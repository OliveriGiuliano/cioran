 THE DEMIURGE With the exception of some aberrant cases man does not incline to the good what god would impel him to do so Man must vanquish himself must do himself violence in order to perform the slightest action untainted by evil And each time he succeeds he provokes or humiliates his Creator If he manages to be good no longer by effort or calculation but by nature he owes his achievement to an inadvertence from on high he situates himself outside the universal order he was foreseen by no divine plan It is difficult to say what station the good man occupies among what we call beings even if he is one Perhaps he is a ghost The good is what was or will be it is what never is Parasite of memory or of anticipation past or possible it cannot be actual present nor subsist in and of itself as such consciousness knows it not and apprehends it only when it disappears Everything proves its insubstantiality the good is a great unreal force a principle which has miscarried from the start lapse immemorial failure its effects are accentuated with the course of history In the beginning in that primal promiscuity where the swerve toward life occurred something unspeakable must have happened which continues in our discomforts if not in our reasonings Who could help concluding that existence has been vitiated at its source existence and the elements themselves The man who fails to envisage this hypothesis at least once a day has gone through life as a sleepwalker    It is difficult it is impossible to believe that the Good Lord Our Father had a hand in the scandal of creation Everything suggests that He took no part in it that it proceeds from a god without scruples a feculent god Goodness does not create lacking imagination it takes imagination to put together a world however botched At the very least there must be a mixture of good and evil in order to produce an action or a work Or a universe Considering ours it is altogether easier to trace matters back to a suspect god than to an honorable one The Good Lord was certainly not equipped for creating He possesses everything except omnipotence Great by His weaknesses anemia and kindness are partners  He is the prototype of ineffectuality He can help no one    Moreover we cling to Him only when we cast off our historical dimension as soon as we resume it He is alien to us incomprehensible He has nothing which fascinates us nothing of the monster Whereupon we turn to the creator inferior and officious god instigator of events In order to understand how he could have created we must imagine him at grips with evil which is innovation and with good which is inertia This struggle must have been fatal to evil which was thereby obliged to endure the contamination of good thus the creation could not be altogether wicked Since evil presides over all that is corruptible in other words over all that is alive it is absurd to try to prove it comprises less being than good does or even that it contains none at all Those who identify evil with nothingness suppose they are thereby saving their poor Good Lord We save Him only if we have the courage to sever His cause from that of the Demiurge Having refused to do so Christianity inveterately sought to impose the inevidence of a merciful Creator a hopeless enterprise which has exhausted Christianity and compromised the God it sought to preserve We cannot help thinking that the Creation had it remained in the rough neither could be completed nor deserved to be the Creation is in fact a fault man s famous sin thereby appearing as a minor version of a much graver one What are we guilty of except of having followed more or less slavishly the Creator s example Easy to recognize in ourselves the fatality which was His not for nothing have we issued from the hands of a wicked and woebegone god a god accursed    Some doomed to believe in the supreme but impotent God others in the Demiurge still others in the Devil we choose neither our venerations nor our blasphemies The Devil is the representative the delegate of the Demiurge whose affairs he manages here on earth Despite his prestige and the terror attached to his name he is merely an administrator merely an angel assigned to a menial task to history Quite different is the sway of the Demiurge how in his absence would we face our ordeals If we were equal to them or even worthy of them to some degree we could abstain from invoking him Before our evident inadequacies we cling to him we even beg him to exist if he were to turn out to be a fiction conceive our distress our shame Upon whom else would we vent our failures our miseries ourselves Appointed by our fiat the author of our deficiencies he serves as our excuse for all we cannot be When furthermore we make him assume the responsibility for this defective universe we enjoy a certain peace no more uncertainty about our origins or our prospects but the utmost security in the insoluble outside the nightmare of promises His merit is indeed inestimable indeed he releases us from our regrets since he has taken upon himself even the initiative of our defeats It is more important to recover in divinity our vices than our virtues We are resigned to our qualities whereas our defects pursue us torment us What a comfort what a reassurance to be able to project them into a god susceptible of falling to our level a god not confined in the insipidity of commonly acknowledged attributes The Demiurge is the most useful god who ever was If he were not under our hand where would our bile be poured out Each and every form of hate tends as a last resort toward him Since we all believe that our merits are misunderstood or flouted how admit that so general an iniquity could be the doing of mere man It must go back further and belong to some ancient dirty work to the very act of the Creation Thus we know whom to blame whom to disparage nothing flatters and sustains us so much as being able to put the source of our indignity as far away from us as possible As for God in the strict sense the good and debilitated One we come to terms with Him whenever there no longer remains in us the trace of a world in those moments that postulate Him those moments that attached to Him from the start provoke Him create Him and during which He ascends from our depths for the greatest humiliation of our gibes God is the grief of irony Yet let our sarcasms get a hold of themselves let them regain the upper hand and our relations with Him are strained and broken Then we tire of questioning ourselves on His account we want to dismiss Him from our preoccupations and our passions even from our contempt So many others before us have dealt Him telling blows that it seems futile to come now and pummel a corpse And yet He still counts for us if only by our regret at not having trounced Him ourselves    In order to evade the difficulties inherent in dualism we might postulate a single God whose history would develop in two phases in the first discreet anemic retiring with no impulse to manifest Himself a sleeping God exhausted by His own eternity in the second phase ambitious frenzied a God committing mistake after mistake participating in a supremely blameworthy activity Upon reflection this hypothesis seems less clearcut and less advantageous than that of the two distinct gods But if we find that neither one accounts for what this world is worth we shall then always have the resource of believing with certain Gnostics that it was drawn by lot among the angels It is pitiable it is degrading to identify the divinity with a person Divinity will never be an idea nor an anonymous principle for the man who has frequented the Testaments Twenty centuries of altercation are not forgotten overnight Whether taking its inspiration from Job or from Saint Paul our religious life is dispute outrage excess Atheists so ready with their invective prove that they have someone in their sights They should be less conceited their emancipation is not so complete as they suppose they have exactly the same notion of God as believers    The Creator is the absolute of external man the inner man in return considers the Creation as an awkward detail as a futile episode even a fatal one Every profound religious experience begins precisely where the realm of the Demiurge ends It has only him to deal with it denounces him it is his negation So much does he obsess us he and the world that there is no way of escaping either in order to unite in an outburst of annihilation with the uncreated and to dissolve within it With the help of ecstasy whose object is a god without attributes an essence of god we raise ourselves toward a purer form of apathy than that of the supreme God Himself and if we plunge into the divine we are nonetheless beyond any form of divinity for that Here is the final stage the goal of mysticism the point of departure being the break with the Demiurge the refusal to consort further with him and to applaud his works No one kneels to him no one venerates him The only words we address to the Demiurge are backward supplications sole mode of communication between an equally fallen creature and creator    By inflicting upon the official God the functions of Father Creator and general manager we exposed Him to attacks to which He was to succumb What might have been His longevity if only we had heeded Marcion of all heresiarchs the one who most vigorously opposed evil s sleight of hand who contributed most to the glory of the Demiurge by the hatred he felt for him There is no example of another religion which at the outset has missed so many opportunities We should assuredly be quite different if the Christian era had been inaugurated by the execration of the Creator for the permission to abuse Him would not have failed to lighten our burden and to render the last two millennia that much less oppressive By refusing to incriminate Him and to adopt the doctrines which would unhesitatingly do so the Church was to commit itself to cunning and deception At least we have the comfort of observing that what is most alluring in its history are its most intimate enemies all those it has opposed and rejected those who in order to safeguard God s honor impugned at the risk of martyrdom His role as Creator Fanatics of the divine nothingness of that absence in which the Supreme Good delights they knew the joy of hating this God and of loving that one without restrictions without second thoughts Swept on by their faith they would have been in no position to discern the touch of imposture which enters into even the sincerest torment The notion of pretext was not yet born nor was that quite modern temptation of hiding our agonies behind some theological acrobatics Yet a certain ambiguity existed among them what were these Gnostics and these Manicheans of every sort but perverts of purity compulsives of horror Evil attracted them almost overwhelmed them without evil their existence would have been    vacant They hunted it down unflagging And if they argued so vehemently that evil was uncreated it was because they secretly longed for it to subsist forever in order that they might delight in it might practice through all eternity their combative virtues Having for love of the Father reflected to excess upon the Adversary they were to end by understanding damnation better than salvation This is why they had grasped so well the essence of the fallen world Will the Church after having spewed them forth be clever enough to appropriate their theses and charitable enough to cast the Creator in a starring role in order to excommunicate Him at the end It will be reborn only by exhuming the heresies by annulling its old anathemas in order to pronounce new ones    Timid devoid of dynamism the good is inept at communicating itself Evil much more zealous seeks to transmit itself and succeeds because it possesses the double privilege of being fascinating and contagious Hence we see a bad Demiurge extend himself get outside himself more easily than a good God We have all inherited something of this incapacity to remain within ourselves whereof the Creator was to make so vexing a demonstration to engender is to continue in another fashion and on another scale the enterprise which bears his name it is by a deplorable mimicry to add to His creation Without the encouragement He has given the desire to extend the chain of beings would not exist nor that necessity to subscribe to the gimmicks of the flesh Every childbirth is suspect the angels luckily are unsuited to it the propagation of life being reserved to the fallen The plague is impatient and greedy it loves to spread There is every reason to discourage generation for the fear of seeing humanity die out has no basis whatever happens there will everywhere be enough fools who ask only to perpetuate themselves and if they themselves end by flinching from the task there will always be found to devote themselves to the cause some hideous couple    It is not so much the appetite for life that is to be opposed as the lust for lineage Parents genitors are provocateurs or mad What could be more demoralizing than the fact that the worst freak should have the faculty of giving life of bringing into the world How contemplate without dread or repulsion the wonder that makes the first man in the street a demiurge on the brink What should be a gift as exceptional as genius has been conferred indiscriminately upon all a liberality of base coinage which forever disqualifies nature The criminal injunction of Genesis Be fruitful and multiply    could never have come out of the mouth of the Good Lord Be ye rare He would have suggested surely if He had had any say in the matter Nor could He ever have added the fatal words    and replenish the earth They should be erased without delay in order to cleanse the Bible of the shame of having garnered them The flesh spreads further and further like a gangrene upon the surface of the globe It cannot impose limits upon itself it continues to be rife despite its rebuffs it takes its defeats for conquests it has never learned anything It belongs above all to the realm of the Creator and it is indeed in the flesh that He has projected His maleficent instincts Normally the flesh should be less harmful to those who contemplate it than to those who extend its duration and assure its progress Far from it for they do not know what aberration it is that they are accomplices of Pregnant women will some day be stoned to death the maternal instinct proscribed sterility acclaimed It is with good reason that in the sects which held fecundity in suspicion the Bogomils for instance and the Cathari marriage was condemned that abominable institution which all societies have always protected to the despair of those who do not yield to the common delirium To procreate is to love the scourge to seek to maintain and to augment it They were right those ancient philosophers who identified fire with the principle of the universe and with desire for desire burns devours annihilates At once agent and destroyer of beings it is sombre it is infernal by essence This world was not created in joy Yet we procreate in pleasure True enough but pleasure is not joy it is joy s simulacrum its function consists in deceiving in making us forget that creation bears down to its least detail the mark of that initial melancholy from which it issued Necessarily illusory it is pleasure too which permits us to carry out certain performances which in theory we repudiate Without its cooperation continence gaining ground would seduce even the rats But it is in what we call the transports of the flesh that we understand how fraudulent pleasure is In the flesh pleasure reaches its peak its maximum intensity and it is here at the zenith of its success that it suddenly opens to its unreality that it collapses in its own void The voluptuous flesh is the disaster of pleasure We cannot grant that a god or even a man proceeds from a gymnastic climaxed by a moan It is curious that at the end of such a long period of time evolution has not managed to perfect another formula Why should it take the trouble moreover when the one in force functions so well and suits everybody Let there be no mistake life in itself is not in question life is as mysterious and enervating as could be wished What is not so is the exercise in question of an inadmissible facility given the consequences When we know what fate permits each man we remain stunned by the disproportion between a moment s oblivion and the prodigious quantity of disgraces which result from it The more one reverts to this subject the more one finds that the only men who have understood anything about it are those who have opted for orgy or for asceticism the debauched or the castrated Since procreation supposes a nameless distraction it is certain that if we were to become prudent in other words indifferent to the fate of the race we should retain only a few samples the way we preserve certain creatures of vanishing species Let us block the way of all flesh let us try to paralyze its alarming spread We are in the presence of a veritable epidemic of life a proliferation of faces Where and how to remain still facetoface with God No one is continually subject to the obsession with this horror Sometimes we turn from it almost forget it especially when we contemplate some landscape from which our own kind is absent Once they appear there the obsession returns settles down in the mind If we were inclined to absolve the creator to consider this world as acceptable and even satisfying we should still have to make certain reservations about man that blot on the creation    We can imagine that the Demiurge imbued with the inadequacy or the harmfulness of his production might someday cause it to perish and even manage to disappear along with it But we can also conceive that down through the ages he has been concerned only to destroy himself and that what we call becoming is no more than the slow process of this autodestruction Lagging or gasping in either eventuality the process involves a reflexive movement a scrutiny of conscience whose result would be the casting out of the creation by its author What is anchored deepest in us and is least perceptible is the sentiment of an essential failure hidden from all including the gods And what is remarkable is that most of us are far from realizing that we experience this sentiment We are moreover by a special favor of nature doomed not to become aware of it Our power resides in our incapacity to know how alone we are Blessed ignorance thanks to which we can act or at least act up Once we have the revelation of this secret our inner spring immediately breaks and irremediably This is what has happened to the Creator or what will happen to Him perhaps    Always to have lived with the nostalgia to coincide with something but not really knowing with what    It is easy to shift from unbelief to belief or conversely But what is there to convert to and what is there to abjure in a state of chronic lucidity Lacking substance it offers no content that can be disclaimed it is empty and one does not disclaim the void lucidity is the negative equivalent of ecstasy To coincide with nothing is not to coincide any better with ourselves whence these faithless appeals these vacillating convictions these fervorlacking fevers this division which makes a victim of our ideas and even of our reflexes At first we kept that ambiguity which governs all our relations with this world and the other for ourselves Subsequently we have extended it around us so that no one may escape it so that no man alive knows what he may still abide by Nothing clear anywhere By our defection things themselves stagger and subside into perplexity What we need is that gift of imagining the possibility of prayer indispensable to anyone in pursuit of his salvation Hell is inconceivable prayer The founding of a universal ambiguity is our most calamitous exploit it makes us rivals of the Demiurge    We were happy only in the ages when greedy for obliteration we enthusiastically accepted our nothingness Religious feeling emanates not from the acknowledgement of but from the desire for our insignificance from our need to wallow in it How will this need inherent in our nature be satisfied now that we can no longer live in the wake of the gods In other times it was the gods who abandoned us today we abandon them We have lived beside them too long for them still to find grace in our sight Always within reach we heard them stirring they watched us spied on us we were no longer at home Now as experience teaches there exists no being more odious than our neighbor The fact of knowing him to be so close in space keeps us from breathing and makes our days and our nights equally unfeasible Try as we will to brood upon his ruin he is there hideously present To suppress him is the impulse of every thought when we finally determine to do so a spasm of cowardice grips us just before the act Thus we are the potential murderers of those who live beside us and from our incapacity to be the actual ones comes our torment our bitterness dilettantes and eunuchs of bloodshed that we are If with the gods everything seemed simpler it is because their indiscretion was immemorial We had to be done with it at all costs Were they not too cumbersome to be endured any longer Hence none of us could fail to add his little voice to the general hue and cry against them When we think of these ageold companions or enemies of all the lords of sects religions and mythologies the only one we are reluctant to part with is this Demiurge to whom we attach the very evils we so much want him to be the cause of It is the Demiurge we think of apropos of each and every act of life and of life itself Whenever we consider it whenever we examine its origins life amazes us alarms us it is a dreadful miracle which must proceed from him a special god a case utterly apart There is no use insisting he does not exist when our daily stupors are there to demand his reality and to proclaim it Even if we argue that perhaps he existed but that he has died like the rest those stupors of ours will not be gainsaid They will busy themselves reviving him and he will last as long as our amazement and our alarm as long as our intimidated curiosity before all that is all that lives We may say Conquer fear so that only amazement remains But to conquer fear to make it vanish we should have to attack its very principle and demolish its foundations to rebuild nothing more or less than the world in its totality nimbly to switch Demiurges confiding ourselves in short to another creator THE NEW GODS A man interested in the procession of ideas and of irreducible beliefs will find it worth his while to pause over the spectacle afforded by the first centuries of our era here he will discover the very model of all the forms of conflict to be met with in attenuated form at any moment of history Quite understandably this is the epoch when men hated the most For which the credit goes to the Christians feverish intractable from the start expert in the art of detestation whereas the pagans could no longer manage anything but scorn Aggression is a trait common to men and new gods If some monster of amenity ignorant of spleen nonetheless wanted to become versed in that subject or at least to learn what it is worth the simplest method would be for him to read some ecclesiastical authors beginning with Tertullian the most brilliant of all and ending say with Saint Gregory of Nazianzus rancorous yet insipid whose oration against Julian the Apostate makes you feel like converting then and there to paganism The emperor is conceded no virtues whatever with unconcealed satisfaction his heroic death in the Persian War is contested for Gregory claims he was despatched by a barbarian who was a buffoon by trade following the armies in order to divert the soldiers from the hardships of war by his gibes and witticisms No elegance no concern to appear worthy of such an adversary What is unforgivable in the saint s case is that he had known Julian at Athens in the days when the two young men had frequented the philosophical schools there Nothing more odious than the tone of those who are defending a cause one compromised in appearance winning in fact who cannot contain their delight at the idea of their triumph nor help turning their very terrors into so many threats When Tertullian sardonic and trembling describes the Last Judgment the greatest of spectacles as he calls it he imagines the laugh he will have contemplating so many monarchs and gods uttering dreadful groans in the depths of the abyss    This insistence upon reminding the pagans that they were lost they and their idols was liable to exasperate even the most temperate A series of libels camouflaged as treatises Christian apologetics represents the acme of the bilious genre Man can breathe only in the shadow of eroded divinities The more convinced of this we are the more we remind ourselves in terror that had we lived at the moment of Christianity s rise we might well have submitted to its fascination The beginnings of a religion like the beginnings of anything are always suspect They alone though possess some reality they alone are true true and abominable We do not watch the founding of a god whoever he may be and wherever he comes from with impunity Nor is this disadvantage a recent one Prometheus already called attention to it a victim to Zeus and the new gang of Olympus Much more than the prospect of salvation it was rage against the ancient world which swept on the Christians in a single impulse of destruction Since they came for the most part from elsewhere their outburst of fury against Rome is understandable But what sort of frenzy was it in which the citizen participated when he became a convert Not so well prepared as the others he possessed but one recourse to hate himself Without this deviation of hatred at first atypical subsequently contagious Christianity would have remained no more than a sect limited to a foreign clientele actually capable of no more than painlessly trading in the old gods for a nailed corpse Let the man who wonders how he would have reacted to Constantine s change of policy put himself in the place of a partisan of the tradition a pagan proud of being so how consent to the Cross how tolerate that symbol of a disgraceful death emblazoned on the Roman standards Yet such men resigned themselves to it and it is difficult for us to imagine the cumulus of inner defeats from which this resignation issued If in the moral realm we may conceive it as the consummation of a crisis and thereby grant it the status or the excuse of a conversion such resignation appears as a betrayal as soon as we consider it from the political viewpoint To abandon the gods who made Rome was to abandon Rome herself to form an alliance with this new race of men born yesterday having neither country nor traditions leagued together against every religious and civil institution pursued by the law universally decried for their infamies yet glorying in this common execration Celsius s diatribe dates from  About two centuries later Julian was to write If in the reigns of Tiberius or Claudius a single distinguished mind is known to have become a convert to Christian ideas consider me as the greatest of impostors The new race of men was to take no end of trouble before overcoming the scruples of the cultivated How trust these unknown men who were appearing out of the lower depths and whose every gesture invited disdain For that was just it by what means accept the God of those one despises and Who was furthermore of such recent manufacture Age alone guaranteed the validity of the gods all were tolerated provided they were not newly minted What was regarded as particularly troublesome in the case was the absolute novelty of the Son a contemporary a parvenu    It was this disheartening figure whom no sage had foreseen nor prefigured who shocked most His appearance was a scandal which it took four centuries to get used to The Father an old acquaintance was admitted for tactical reasons the Christians fell back upon Him and spoke in His name were not the books which celebrated Him and whose spirit the Gospels perpetuated according to Tertullian several centuries older than the temples the oracles the pagan gods The apologist once launched goes so far as to claim that Moses antedates the fall of Troy by several thousand years Such divagations were meant to combat the effect which might be provoked by remarks like this of Celsius s After all the Jews many centuries ago organized themselves into a nation established laws of their own which they retain even today The religion they observe whatever its worth and whatever may be said of it is the religion of their ancestors By remaining faithful to it they do no more than other men do as well who all preserve the customs of their country To sacrifice to the prejudice of antiquity was implicitly to recognize the indigenous gods as the only legitimate ones The Christians were quite willing for selfish motives to bow to this prejudice as such but they could not without destroying themselves go further and adopt it entirely with all its consequences For an Origen the ethnic gods were idols relics of polytheism Saint Paul had already reduced them to the rank of demons Judaism regarded them all as false except one its own Their only error Julian says of the Jews is that even as they seek to satisfy their god they do not serve the others at the same time Yet he praises them for their repugnance to follow the fashion with regard to religion I shun innovation in all things and especially in that which concerns the gods an admission which has discredited him and which is used to brand him as a reactionary But what progress one wonders does Christianity represent in relation to paganism There is no qualitative leap from one god to another nor from one civilization to another any more than from one language to another Who would dare to proclaim the superiority of the Christian writers over the pagan ones Even the Prophets though of another inspiration and another style than the Church Fathers produced Saint Jerome confesses an aversion in the reader who has returned to Cicero or to Plautus Progress at the time was embodied in these unreadable Fathers then was to turn away from them to go over to reaction  Julian was entirely correct in preferring to them Homer Thucydides or Plato The edict by which he forbade Christian educators to explicate the Greek authors has been harshly criticized not only by his adversaries but even by all his admirers in all periods Without seeking to justify him one cannot help understanding him He was dealing with fanatics to gain their respect it was occasionally necessary to exaggerate as they did to spin out some nonsense for their sake or else they would have scorned him as no more than an amateur He therefore requires these instructors to imitate the writers they were expounding and to share their opinions of the gods Yet if they believe that these authors have been deceived as to the most important point let them go into the churches of the Galileans to offer commentaries on Matthew and Luke In the eyes of the ancients the more gods you recognize the better you serve divinity whereof they are but the aspects the faces To seek to limit their number was an impiety to suppress them all for the sake of but one a crime It is of this crime that the Christians made themselves guilty Irony in their regard was no longer appropriate The evil they were propagating had gained too much ground All of Julian s harshness derives from the impossibility of treating them offhandedly    Polytheism corresponds better to the diversity of our tendencies and our impulses which it offers the possibility of expressing of manifesting each of them being free to tend according to its nature toward the god who suits it at the moment But how deal with a single god How envisage him how utilize him In his presence we live continually under pressure Monotheism curbs our sensibility it deepens us by narrowing us A system of constraints which affords us an inner dimension at the cost of the flowering of our powers it constitutes a barrier it halts our expansion it throws us out of gear Surely we were more normal with several gods than we are with only one If health is a criterion what a setback monotheism turns out to be Under the regime of several gods fervor is shared When it is addressed to one god alone it is concentrated exacerbated and ends by turning into aggression into faith Energy is no longer dispersed it is entirely focussed in one direction What was remarkable in paganism is that no radical distinction was made between believing and not believing having faith or not having it Faith is a Christian invention it supposes one and the same disequilibrium in man and in God swept on by a dialogue as dramatic as it is disordered Whence the frantic character of the new religion The old one so much more human left you the faculty of choosing the god you wanted since it imposed none upon you it was up to you to incline toward one or another The more capricious you were the more you needed to change gods to shift from one to another being quite certain of finding the means of adoring them all in the course of one existence Furthermore they were modest they demanded only respect You hailed them you did not kneel before them They were ideally suited to the man whose contradictions were not resolved nor could be to the tormented and unappeased mind How fortunate he was in his itinerant confusion to be able to try them all and to be almost certain of falling on just the one he needed most on the occasion After the triumph of Christianity the freedom of maneuvering among them and of choosing one to your taste became inconceivable Their cohabitation their admirable promiscuity was past Would any esthete wearied but not yet disgusted with paganism have adhered to the new religion if he had divined that it was to spread over so many centuries Would he have bartered the caprice suited to a regime of interchangeable idols for a cult whose God was to enjoy so terrifying a longevity To all appearances man has given himself gods out of a need to be protected guaranteed in reality out of a greed to suffer So long as man believed in a multitude of them he had indulged in a freedom of choice in loopholes Subsequently limiting himself to just one he was thereby afflicted by a supplement of shackles and throes Surely there is but one animal which loves and hates itself to the point of vice which could afford the luxury of a subjection so burdensome What cruelty to ourselves to join forces with the great Specter and to weld our lot to His The one God makes life unbreathable Christianity has made use of the Romans juridical rigor and the Greeks philosophical acrobatics not to liberate the mind but to enchain it And by enchaining it Christianity has obliged the mind to deepen to descend into itself The dogmas imprison it assign it outer limits which it may not exceed at any price At the same time they leave the mind free to explore its particular universe to scrutinize its own vertigo and in order to escape the tyranny of doctrinal certitudes to seek out being or its negative equivalent at the extreme verge of all sensation Experience of the pinioned mind ecstasy is necessarily more frequent in an authoritarian religion than in a liberal one this is so because ecstasy is then a leap toward the intimacy of the depths a recourse to inwardness the selfward flight Having had for so long no other refuge but God we have dived as deep into Him as into ourselves a dive which represents the only authentic exploit we have performed in two thousand years  We have sounded His abyss and our own eroded His secrets one by one weakened and compromised His substance by the double aggression of knowledge and of prayer The ancients did not overwork their gods they had too much elegance to harass them so or to make them into a subject of study Since the fatal transition from mythology to theology had not yet been made they knew nothing of that perpetual tension present alike in the accents of the great mystics and in the banalities of the catechism When earth is a synonym for impracticability and when we feel that the contact which binds us to it is physically severed the remedy lies neither in faith nor in the negation of faith each the expression of the same weakness  but in that pagan dilettantism more precisely in our idea of it the idea we forge The most serious disadvantage a Christian encounters is that of not being able to serve consciously more than one god though he has the latitude to adhere in practice to several the worship of saints  A salutary adherence which has permitted polytheism to continue in spite of everything indirectly Without it an excessively pure Christianity would not have failed to found a universal schizophrenia With all due respect to Tertullian the soul is naturally pagan Any god at all when he answers to our immediate needs represents for us an increase of vitality a stimulus which is not the case if he is imposed upon us or if he corresponds to no necessity Paganism s mistake was to have accepted and accumulated too many of them it died of generosity and excess of understanding it died from a lack of instinct If in order to overcome the self that leprosy we no longer bet on anything but appearances it is impossible not to deplore the effacement of a religion without scenes without crises of conscience without incitations to remorse a religion equally superficial in principles and in practices In antiquity it was philosophy not religion which was profound in the modern epoch Christianity alone was the cause of profundity and all the lacerations inherent in it It is the periods without a specific faith the Hellenistic one or our own which busy themselves classifying the gods while refusing to divide them up into the true and the false The notion that the gods are all worth something are each worth as much as any other is on the contrary unacceptable in the intervals when fervor prevails We cannot pray to a god who is probably true Prayer does not demean itself to subtleties nor tolerate distinctions within the Supreme even when it doubts it does so in the name of truth We do not beseech a nuance All of this is the case only since the monotheist calamity For pagan piety matters were quite different In his Octavius Minucius Felix before defending the Christian position makes Cecilius his representative of paganism say We see national gods worshipped at Eleusis Ceres in Phrygia Cybele at Epidaurus Aesculapius in Chaldea Belus in Syria Astarte in Tauris Diana Mercury among the Gauls and in Rome all the gods together And he adds with regard to the Christian god the only one not to be accepted Whence comes he this one god solitary forsaken recognized by no free nation no kingdom     According to an old Roman decree no one was to worship exclusively new or foreign gods if they were not admitted by the State more precisely by the Senate the one competence in deciding which deserved to be adopted or rejected The Christian God appearing on the Empire s periphery reaching Rome by unavowable means was later to take a terrible revenge for having been obliged to enter the capital by fraud A civilization is destroyed only when its gods are destroyed The Christians not daring to attack the Empire head on waylaid its religion They let themselves be persecuted only to be able to fulminate against it all the more effectively in order to satisfy their irrepressible appetite for execration How wretched they would have been had no one deigned to promote them to the rank of victims Everything in paganism including toleration exasperated them Strong in their certainties they could not understand resignation to likelihood in the pagan manner nor adherence to a worship whose priests mere magistrates appointed to the perfunctory forms of ritual imposed upon no one the burden of sincerity When we realize that life is endurable only if we can change gods and that monotheism contains the germ of every form of tyranny we stop commiserating with the ancient institution of slavery It was better to be a slave and to be able to worship one s chosen deity than to be free and to confront only a single variety of the divine Freedom is the right to difference being plurality it postulates the dispersion of the absolute its resolution into a dust of truths equally justified and provisional There is an underlying polytheism in liberal democracy call it an unconscious polytheism conversely every authoritarian regime partakes of a disguised monotheism Curious the effects of monotheist logic a pagan once he became a Christian tended toward intolerance Better to founder with a horde of accommodating gods than to prosper in a despot s shadow In an age when lacking religious conflicts we witness ideological ones the question raised for us is indeed the one which haunted a waning antiquity how to renounce so many gods for just one with this corrective nonetheless that the sacrifice demanded of us is located on a lower level no longer that of gods but that of opinions As soon as a divinity or a doctrine claims supremacy freedom is threatened If we see a supreme value in toleration then everything which does it violence is to be considered as a crime starting with those enterprises of conversion in which the Church has remained unequalled And if she has exaggerated the gravity of the persecutions she was subjected to and absurdly swelled the number of her martyrs it is because having been an oppressive force for so long she needed to cover her misdeeds with noble pretexts to leave pernicious doctrines unpunished would this not have been a betrayal of those who had sacrificed themselves for her Thus it was in a spirit of loyalty that the Church proceeded to the annihilation of the strayed and that she could after having been persecuted for four centuries be a persecutor for fourteen That is the secret the miracle of her perenniality Never were martyrs avenged with more systematic tenacity The advent of Christianity having coincided with that of the Empire certain Fathers Eusebius among others maintained that this coincidence had a profound meaning one God one Emperor In reality it was the abolition of national barriers the possibility of circulating throughout a vast state without frontiers which permitted Christianity to infiltrate to grow rampant Without this opportunity to spread it would have remained a simple dissidence within Judaism instead of becoming an invading religion and what is more troublesome a propagandizing one All means were justified to recruit to reinforce and to expand even those daily obsequies whose apparatus was a real offence as much for the pagans as for the Olympian gods Julian observes that according to the legislators of old since life and death differ altogether the acts relative to one and the other must be performed separately This disjunction the Christians in their fanatic proselytism were not disposed to make they were well aware of the utility of the corpse the advantage to be drawn from it Paganism did not skimp death but was careful not to put it on display For paganism it was a fundamental principle that death is not consonant with broad daylight that death is an insult to the light Death belonged to night and the infernal gods The Galileans have filled up the sepulchers says Julian who never calls Jesus anything but the dead one For pagans worthy of the name the new superstition could seem only an exploitation only a harnessing of the hideous All the more bitterly were they to deplore the progress it was making in every milieu What Celsius could not know but what Julian knew perfectly were the triflers of Christianity those who incapable of subscribing to it altogether nonetheless strained to follow it fearing that if they remained apart they would be excluded from the future Either from opportunism or fear of solitude they wanted to walk beside these men born yesterday but soon called to the role of masters of torturers    However legitimate his passion for the defunct gods Julian had no chance of reviving them Instead of laboring to do so he should have allied himself out of fury with the Manicheans and with them undermined the Church By sacrificing his ideal he would at least have satisfied his rancor What other card than vengeance still remained in his hand A magnificent career of demolition lay open before him and perhaps he would have taken it up had he not been beclouded by a nostalgia for Olympus One does not wage battles in the name of a regret He died young it is true after scarcely two years of rule With ten or twenty before him what service would he not have rendered us all Not that he would have smothered Christianity but he would have compelled it to more modesty We should be less vulnerable for we should not have lived as if we were the center of the universe as if everything even God revolved around us The Incarnation is the most dangerous flattery of which we have been the object It will have granted us an excessive status out of all proportion with what we are By hoisting the human anecdote to the dignity of cosmic drama Christianity has deceived us as to our insignificance has cast us into illusion into that morbid optimism which despite all the evidence identifies progress with apotheosis More prudently pagan antiquity put man in his place When Tacitus wonders if events are ruled by eternal laws or if they come about by chance he manages to avoid answering he leaves the question open and this indecision nicely expresses the general feeling of the ancients More than anyone the historian faced with that mixture of constants and aberrations out of which the historical process is composed is necessarily led to oscillate between determinism and contingency accident and law physics and fortune There is no misfortune which we cannot refer as we like either to a distraction of Providence or to the indifference of Chance or finally to the inflexibility of Fate This trinity so conveniently applicable for anyone especially for a disabused mind is the most comforting thing pagan wisdom has to propose We moderns are reluctant to resort to it as we are no less reluctant to espouse the specifically ancient notion according to which blessings and misfortunes represent an invariable total which cannot undergo any modification With our obsession with progress and regression we implicitly admit that evil changes either diminishes or augments The world s identity with itself the splendid notion that it is condemned to be what it is and that the future will add nothing essential to the existing data no longer has any currency This is precisely because the future an object of horror or hope is our true site we live in it it is everything for us The obsession with advent which is essentially Christian by reducing time to the concept of the imminent and the possible makes us illsuited to conceive an immutable moment resting in itself preserved from the scourge of succession Even stripped of the slightest content expectation is a void which gratifies us an anxiety which reassures so unfit are we for a static vision There is no need for God to correct His works an opinion of Celsius which is that of an entire civilization runs counter to our inclinations to our instincts to our very being We can ratify it only in an unwonted moment in an outburst of wisdom It runs counter even to what the believer holds for what God is most blamed for in religious circles is His good conscience His indifference to the quality of His work and His refusal to mitigate its anomalies We must have a future at any price Belief in the Last Judgment has created the psychological conditions of a belief in the meaning of history Better still all philosophies of history are merely a byproduct of the idea of the Last Judgment However much we may incline toward some cyclical theory the inclination is only an abstract adherence on our part we actually behave as if history were following a linear unfolding as if the various civilizations which have succeeded each other within it were merely stages occupied in order to manifest and fulfill itself by some vast design whose name varies according to our beliefs or our ideologies    Is there a better proof of the inadequacy of our faith than the fact that there are no longer any false gods for us It is hard to see how for a believer the god he prays to and another quite different god can be equally legitimate Faith is exclusion defiance It is because Christianity can no longer detest the other religions it is because it understands them that it is finished the vitality from which intolerance proceeds is in increasingly short supply Now intolerance was once Christianity s raison d etre To its misfortune it has ceased to be monstrous Like polytheism in its decline it is stricken it is paralyzed by an excessive breadth of views Its God has no more prestige for us than Jupiter had for the discomfited pagans What does the chatter around the death of God come down to if not to Christianity s death certificate We dare not attack religion straight on we assail the Boss reproaching Him for being insipid timid temperate No one any longer fears or respects a God who has squandered His capital of cruelty We are marked by all those centuries when to believe in Him was to fear Him when our terrors imagined Him at once compassionate and unscrupulous Whom would He intimidate now when the believers themselves feel Him bypassed now that we can no longer connect Him with the present still less with the future And just as paganism was to give way before Christianity so this last God will have to yield to some new belief Stripped of aggression He no longer constitutes an obstacle to the outburst of other gods they need only arrive and perhaps they will arrive Doubtless they will not have the countenance nor even the mask of the gods but they will be no less fearful for that For a man to whom freedom and vertigo are equivalent a faith wherever it comes from even if it were antireligious is a salutary shackle a desired a dreamedof chain whose function will be to constrain curiosity and fever to suspend the anguish of the indefinite When this faith triumphs and establishes itself what immediately results from it is a reduction of the number of problems which we must raise as well as an almost tragic diminution of choices The burden of choice is taken from us options are made for us The refined pagans who let themselves be tempted by the new religion expected precisely that choices would be made for them that they would be told where to go that they no longer need hesitate on the threshold of so many temples nor tack between so many gods It is by a lassitude a refusal of the mind s peregrinations that it comes to an end this religious effervescence without a credo which characterizes every Alexandrian epoch We denounce the coexistence of truths because we are no longer satisfied with the dearth each one affords We aspire to the All but to a limited a circumscribed a sure All so great is our fear of declining from the universal into the uncertain from the uncertain into the precarious and the amorphous This downfall which paganism knew in its time Christianity is in the process of discovering now It is failing it is eager to fail which makes it endurable to the unbelievers increasingly welldisposed in its behalf Paganism even vanquished was still detested the Christians were fanatics who could not forget whereas in our time everyone has forgiven Christianity As early as the eighteenth century the arguments against it were exhausted Like a venom which has lost its virtues it can no longer save or damn anyone But it has toppled too many gods for it to escape in all justice the fate it has reserved for them Their hour of revenge has come round their joy must be great to see their worst enemy as low as themselves since it acknowledges them all without exception In the time of its triumph Christianity demolished temples and desecrated consciences wherever it chose to appear A new god were he to be crucified a thousand times knows no pity crushes everything in his path strives to occupy the maximum of space Thus he makes us pay dear for not having recognized him sooner So long as he was obscure he could have a certain attraction we did not yet discern in him the stigmata of victory A religion is never nobler than when it comes to the point of taking itself for a superstition and witnessing its own eclipse with detachment Christianity has been formed and has flourished in the hatred of all that was not itself This hatred sustained it throughout its career its career finished its hatred is finished too Christ will not harrow Hell again He has been put back in the tomb and this time he will stay there It is not likely he will never come forth again there is no longer anyone to deliver on the surface or in the depths of the earth When we think of the excesses which accompanied his advent we cannot help thinking too of that exclamation of Rutilius Namatianus the last pagan poet Would to the gods Judea had never been conquered Since it is granted that the gods are true without distinction why stop halfway why not preach them all That would be on the Church s part a supreme accomplishment she would perish bowing before her victims There are signs to indicate she is not unaware of the temptation Thus after the example of the ancient temples the Church would make it a point of honor to collect the divinities the derelicts from everywhere But once again the true god must efface himself in order for all the others to rise again PALEONTOLOGY An unforeseen shower one autumn day drove me into the Museum of Natural History for a while I was to remain there as a matter of fact for an hour two hours perhaps three It has been months since this accidental visit and yet I am not about to forget those empty sockets that stare at you more insistently than eyes that rummage sale of skulls that automatic sneer on every level of zoology Nowhere is one better served with respect to the past Here the possible seems inconceivable or cracked One gets the impression that the flesh was eclipsed upon its advent that in fact it never existed at all that it could not have been fastened to bones so stately so imbued with themselves The flesh appears as an imposture a fraud a disguise which masks nothing Was this all it was And if it is worth no more how does it manage to inspire me with repulsion or with terror I have always felt a predilection for those who were obsessed by its nullity those who made a great case for its insignificance Baudelaire Swift Buddha    The flesh so obvious is yet an anomaly The more we consider it the more aghast we turn away and by dint of such weighing we tend toward the mineral we grow petrified In order to endure the sight or the idea we require much more than courage we require cynicism We are deceived as to its nature if we call it with one Church Father nocturnal That would be paying it too much honor The flesh is neither strange nor shadowy but perishable to the point of indecency to the point of madness It is not only the seat of disease it is itself a disease incurable nothingness a fiction which has degenerated into a calamity The vision I have of it is the vision of a gravedigger infected with metaphysics Doubtless I am wrong to keep thinking about it one cannot live and lay much stress on it A colossus would perish in the attempt I feel it as it is not permitted to feel it it takes advantage of the fact it obliges me to confer upon it a disproportionate status and monopolizes me to such an extent that my mind is no more than viscera Next to the solidity the seriousness of the skeleton it seems absurdly provisional and frivolous It flatters it gratifies the addict of precariousness I am That is why I am so comfortable in this museum where everything encourages the euphoria of a universe swept clean of the flesh the jubilation of an afterlife At the entrance man standing All the other animals slumped over borne down sagging even the giraffe despite its neck even the iguanodon grotesque in its effort to pull itself upright Closer to us that orangutan that gorilla that chimpanzee easy to see that they have struggled in vain to be erect Their efforts having failed they stay where they are unhappy arrested halfway thwarted in their pursuit of verticality Hunchbacks in short We should be like them still no doubt about it without the luck we had to take one decisive step forward Ever since we labor tooth and nail to eliminate every trace of our low extraction whence that provocative expression so peculiar to man Beside him his posture and the airs he assumes even the dinosaurs seem timid Since his real reverses are only beginning he will have time to settle down Everything suggests that returning to his initial phase he will rejoin this chimpanzee this gorilla this orangutan that he will resemble them once again and that it will be increasingly uncomfortable for him to fidget in his vertical posture Perhaps indeed yielding to fatigue he will be even more bowed than his former companions Having reached the threshold of senility he will reape himself for one fails to see what would be better for him to do    Much more than the skeleton it is the flesh I mean the carrion flesh which disturbs and alarms us and which alleviates us as well The Buddhist monks gladly frequented charnel houses where corner desire more surely and emancipate oneself from it The horrible being a path of liberation in every period of fervor and inwardness our remains have enjoyed great favor In the Middle Ages a man made a regimen of salvation he believed energetically the corpse was in fashion Faith was vigorous then invincible it cherished the livid and the fetid it knew the profits to be derived from corruption and gruesomeness Today an edulcorated religion adheres only to nice hallucinations to Evolution and to Progress It is not such a religion which might afford us the modern equivalent of the danse macabre Let a man who aspires to nirvana act so that nothing is dear to him we read in a Buddhist text It is enough to consider these specters to meditate on the fate of the flesh which adhered to them in order to understand the urgency of detachment There is no ascesis in the double rumination on the flesh and on the skeleton on the dreadful decrepitude of the one and the futile permanence of the other It is a good exercise to sever ourselves now and then from our face from our skin to lay aside this deceptive sheathe then to discard if only for a moment that layer of grease which keeps us from discerning what is fundamental in ourselves Once the exercise is over we are freer and more alone almost invulnerable In order to vanquish attachments and the disadvantages which derive from them we should have to contemplate the ultimate nudity of a human being force our eyes to pierce his entrails and all the rest wallow in the horror of his secretions in his physiology of an imminent corpse This vision would not be morbid but methodical a controlled obsession particularly salutary in ordeals The skeleton incites us to serenity the cadaver to renunciation In the sermon on futility which both of them preach to us happiness is identified with the destruction of our bonds To have scanted no detail of such a teaching and even so to come to terms with simulacra Blessed was that age when solitaries could plumb their depths without seeming obsessed deranged Their imbalance was not assigned a negative coefficient as is the case for us They would sacrifice ten twenty years a whole life for a foreboding for a flash of the absolute The word depth has a meaning only in connection with epochs when the monk was considered as the noblest human exemplar No one will gainsay the fact that he is in the process of disappearing For centuries he has done no more than survive himself To whom would he address himself in a universe which calls him a parasite  In Tibet the last country where monks still mattered they have been ruled out Yet it was a rare consolation to think that thousands and thousands of hermits could be meditating there today on the themes of the prajnaparamita Even if it had only odious aspects monasticism would still be worth more than any other ideal Now more than ever we should build monasteries    for those who believe in everything and for those who believe in nothing Where to escape There no longer exists a single place where we can professionally execrate this world    In order to conceive and to steep ourselves in unreality we must have it constantly present to our minds The day we feel it see it everything becomes unreal except that unreality which alone makes existence tolerable One sign of enlightenment is to have the obsession of the aggregate the everincreasing feeling of being just the place where certain elements come together welded for the moment Conceived as a substantial and irreducible datum the self dumbfounds more than its reassures How to admit that anything that seemed to hold so fast should let go should stop How to be parted from what subsists by itself from what is We can discard an illusion no matter how inveterate but what to do when we are faced with the consistent with the durable If there is only what exists if being spreads everywhere how do we break away from it without falling to pieces Let us postulate a universal fallacy out of precaution or therapeutic concern The fear there is nothing is followed by the fear there is something We are far more comfortable bidding farewell to nonbeing than to being Not that this world doesn t exist but its reality is no such thing Everything seems to exist and nothing exists Every concerted pursuit even that of nirvana if we are not free to abandon it is a shackle as much as any other The knowledge we convert into an idol is corrupted into an unknowing as the Vedic wisdom already preached They are in the depths of darkness those who give themselves up to ignorance those who delight in knowledge are in a darkness deeper still To think without being any the wiser or rather not to think at all but to remain there and to devour the silence that is where perspicacity should lead No pleasure is comparable to that of knowing we don t think It will be objected Isn t knowing we don t think still thinking No doubt but the wretchedness of thought is surmounted for the time that instead of leaping from idea to idea we remain deliberately within just one one which rejects all the rest and which dissolves itself as soon as it takes for its content its own absence This interference with the normal mechanism of the mind is fruitful only if we can renew it at will It must cure us of the subjection to knowledge of the superstition of system The deliverance which seduces which beclouds us is not deliverance We must act so that nothing is ours beginning with desire that generator of dread When everything makes us tremble the one recourse is to realize that if fear being a sensation the sensation par excellence is real the world which causes it is reduced to a transitory assemblage of unreal elements In short our fear is intense in proportion as we give credence to the self and to the world and that our fear must inevitably diminish when we discover the imposture of the former and of the latter Only our triumph over things is real only our realization of unreality which our acumen constructs every day every hour To be delivered is to rejoice in this unreality to seek it out each moment    Seen from outside each being is an accident a lie except in love but love is located outside of knowledge outside the truth  Perhaps we should regard ourselves from outside somewhat as we regard other people and try to have nothing further in common with ourselves If toward myself I were to behave as a stranger I should see myself die with utter unconcern my death would be mine no more than my life One and the other insofar as they belong to me and I assume them represent ordeals beyond my powers When on the contrary I convince myself that they lack intrinsic existence and that they are of no concern to me what a relief Why then knowing that in the last resort everything is unreal still be carried away for such trifles I am carried away granted but I am not involved which is to say that I take no real interest This disinterest I cultivate I achieve only when I trade in my old self for a new one the self of a disabused vision which triumphs here amid these ghosts where everything enfeebles me where the one I was seems to me so remote so incomprehensible The evidence on which I used to turn my back now is discernible in all its clarity The advantage I derive from this is that I no longer feel any obligation with regard to my flesh to any flesh A far better context in which to savor the eighteen varieties of void set forth in the Mahayanist texts so scrupulous in cataloguing the several types of deficiency For here instantly I am in an acute state of unreality    It is scarcely credible to what degree fear adheres to the flesh it is glued to it inseparable almost indistinct from it These skeletons happy skeletons feel no such thing Fear is the one fraternal link which joins us to the animals though they know it only in its natural its healthy form so to speak They know nothing of that other fear the one which arises without motive which we can reduce depending on our whim either to a metaphysical process or to a lunatic chemistry and which daily at an unpredictable moment attacks us overwhelms us In order to hold it in check we would require the cooperation of all the erstwhile gods It reveals itself at the nadir of our daily failure at the very moment when we would be quite ready to disappear if a mere nothing did not keep us from it this nothing is the secret of our verticality To remain erect standing implies a dignity a discipline that has been laboriously inculcated in us and that still saves us at the last minute in that spasm when we grasp what may be abnormal in the career of the flesh threatened boycotted by the sum of elements which define it The flesh has betrayed matter the discomfort it feels it endures is its punishment In a general way the animate appears quite guilty with regard to the inert life is a state of guilt a state all the more serious in that no one is really conscious of it But a crime coextensive with the individual which weighs upon him without his knowledge which is the price he must pay for his promotion to a separate existence for the infraction committed against the undivided creation This crime is no less real for being unconscious and is crucial to the prostration of every creature As I circulate among the carcasses I try to conceive of the burden of fear they must have borne and when I stop in front of the three apes I cannot fail to attribute the evolutionary hitch they have suffered to an analogous burden which weighing upon them has given them that obsequious and flustered expression And even these reptiles isn t it under a like load that they have had to grovel so shamefully and to concoct their venom in the dust of the earth if only to be revenged for their ignominy Whatever is alive the most repellent animal or insect shudders with fear does nothing but Whatever is alive by the simple fact of living deserves commiseration And I think of all those I have known all those who are no more long since sprawling in their coffins forever exempt from flesh and from fear And I feel relieved of the weight of their death Anxiety is consciousness of fear a fear to the second degree a fear reflecting upon itself It consists of the impossibility of communing with the all of assimilating ourselves with it of losing ourselves in it It breaks the current which passes from the world to us from us to the world and favors our reflections only to frustrate their growth ceaselessly disintoxicating the mind Now there is no speculation of any scope which does not proceed from rapture from a loss of control from a faculty to lose and hence to renew the self Inspiration in reverse anxiety calls us to heel at the slightest impulse the slightest divagation This surveillance is deadly to thought suddenly paralyzed trapped in a calamitous circle doomed never to escape itself except by fits and starts by stealth Hence it is true that if our apprehensions make us seek deliverance yet it is they which keep us from achieving it Though he dreads the future to the point of making it the sole object of his preoccupations the anxious man is a prisoner of the past he is in fact the only man who really has a past His tribulations of which he is the slave move him forward only to yank him back He comes thereby to regret the raw anonymous fear from which everything starts the fear that is beginning origin principle of everything alive Terrible as it is such fear is nonetheless endurable since whatever lives resigns itself to it It lacerates and ravages the living it does not annihilate them Such is not the case with this refined fear this recent fear posterior to the appearance of the self in which the diffuse omnipresent danger is never materialized a reflexive fear which for lack of other nourishment devours itself    If I have not returned to the museum I have been there in spirit almost every day thereby deriving considerable advantage what could be more settling than to brood over this ultimate simplification of beings A moment comes when the imagination clears and you see yourself as you will be a sermon no a seizure of modesty On the proper use of the skeleton    We should help ourselves to it in difficult moments especially since we have it right under our hand I have no need of Holbein nor of Baldung Grien with respect to the macabre I rely on my own resources If I see the necessity for it or if I am overcome by a craving there is no one I cannot strip of his carnal envelope Why envy or fear those bones which bear such and such a name that skull which has no love for me Why too love someone or love myself why suffer in any case when I know the image I must invoke in order to alleviate these miseries The sharpened consciousness of what lies in wait for the flesh ought to destroy both love and hate Actually it manages only to attenuate and in rare moments to subdue them Otherwise it would be only too easy represent death and be happy     and the macabre gratifying our most secret desires would be all profit I suspect that I would never have returned in flesh or in spirit so often to those premises if evidently they hadn t flattered my incapacity for illusion Here where man is nothing you realize how unsuited the doctrines of deliverance are to understand him to interpret his past and to decipher his future This is because deliverance has a content only for each of us individually and not for the mob which is unable to grasp the relation between the idea of emptiness and the sensation of freedom It is hard to see how humanity might be saved en bloc engulfed in the false committed to an inferior truth it will always confuse substance with semblance Granting against all appearances that it is following an ascending path humanity cannot acquire at its zenith the level of insight of even the most obtuse Hindu sanyasi In everyday existence it is impossible to say if this world is real or unreal What we can do what we do do is to keep shifting from one thesis to the other all too happy to evade a choice which would settle none of our immediate difficulties Awakening is independent of intellectual capacities a genius can be a dunce spiritually speaking Moreover knowledge as such gets one no further An illiterate can possess the eye of understanding and thereby find himself above and beyond any scholar To discern that what you are is not you that what you have is not yours to be no longer the accomplice of anything even of your own life that is to see clearly that is to get down to the zero root of everything The wider you open yourself to vacuity the more deeply you steep yourself in it the further you remove yourself from the fatality of being yourself of being man of being alive If everything is null and void this triple fatality will be so too Thereby the magic of the tragic is exorcised Is the failing hero worth as little as the hero who finally triumphs Nothing more glamorous than a splendid ending if this world is real if it is not it is pure foolishness to go into ecstasies over any denouement whatever To deign to have a destiny to be blinded or only tempted by the extraordinary proves that we remain opaque to any higher truth that we are far from possessing the eye in question To situate someone is to determine his degree of awakening the progress he has made in the perception of the false and the illusory in others in himself No communion is conceivable with the man who deceives himself as to what he is As the interval separating us from our actions widens we see the subjects of dialogue and the number of our kind diminish Such solitude does not engender bitterness for it does not derive from our talents but from our renunciations Yet it must be added that it does not in the least exclude the danger of spiritual pride which certainly exists as long as we nurse the sacrifices we have consented to and the illusions we have rejected How vanquish ourselves unbeknownst when detachment demands an insistent sounding of consciousness Thus what makes it possible threatens it at the same time In the order of internal values any superiority which does not become impersonal turns to perdition If only one could wrest oneself from the world without realizing the fact One should be able to forget that detachment is a virtue otherwise instead of delivering it envenoms To attribute to God our successes of any sort to believe that nothing emanates from ourselves that everything is given that according to Ignatius Loyola is the one effective means of struggling with pride The recommendation is valid for the thunderbolt states in which the intervention of grace seems de rigueur but not for detachment an undermining labor long and painful of which the self is the victim how fail to pride yourself on that Our spiritual level may be raised yet we do not thereby change qualitatively we remain prisoners of our limits the impossibility of uprooting spiritual pride is one consequence of it the most unfortunate one No creature Saint Thomas observes can attain a higher degree of nature without ceasing to exist Yet if man interests us it is precisely for having sought to surmount his nature He has not managed to do so and his inordinate efforts were not to fail in adulterating in denaturing him This is why we do not question ourselves in his regard without torment without passion No doubt it is also more decent to commiserate with him than with oneself as Pascal so well understood  In the long run this passion becomes so tiring that we think of nothing but means of escaping it Neither the fatality of being oneself nor that of being alive can be compared with that of being man once that fatality spurs me on I reconstruct in order to escape it my promenade among those bones which these days have so often been helpful to me I recognize them I cling to them confirming me in my belief in vacuity they grant me a glimpse of the day when I shall no longer have to endure the obsession of the human of all shackles the most terrible From that we must free ourselves at all costs if we would be free at all but to be really free one more step must be taken to be free of liberty itself to reduce it to the level of a prejudice or a pretext in order not to have to idolize it any longer    Only then will we begin to learn how to act without desire For this the meditation on the horrible prepares us to circle around the flesh and its decrepitude is to be initiated into the art of dissociating desire and act an operation fatal to enterprising minds indispensable to contemplative ones So long as we desire we live in subjection we are given over to the world once we cease to desire we accumulate the privileges of an object and of a god we no longer depend on anyone That desire cannot be extirpated is all too true yet what peace merely to imagine being exempt from it A peace so unwonted that a perverse pleasure creeps into it would not so suspect a sensation come down to nature s revenge upon the man who has made himself guilty of aspiring to a state so unnatural Outside of nirvana in life a rare exploit a virtually inaccessible extremity the suppression of desire is a chimera we do not suppress desire we suspend it and this suspension very strangely is accompanied by a sense of power by a new an unknown certainty The vogue of monasticism in past centuries is doubtless explained by this dilation succeeding the ebb of appetites It takes strength to struggle against desire this strength increases when desire withdraws desire halted fear halts as well For anxiety on its part to conclude any such truce we must go further we must confront a much more rarefied space we must approach an abstract joy an exaltation granted alike to being and to the absence of being It is said in the Katha Upanishad apropos of Atman that it is joyous and without joy That is a state to which we accede as well by the affirmation as by the negation of a supreme principle as much by the detour of Vedanta as by that of Mahayana Different as they may be the two paths meet in the final experience in the glide outside appearances What is essential is less to know in whose name one seeks liberation than how far one can advance on the path to it Whether one is dissolved into the absolute or into the void in either case it is a neutral joy one achieves a joy without any determination as denuded as the anxiety of which it seeks to be the remedy and of which it is merely the outcome the positive conclusion Between them the symmetry is patent they may each be said to be constructed on the same model they dispense with any external stimulant they are selfsufficient they correspond and communicate in depth For just as concrete joy is only a vanquished fear neutral joy is only a transfigured anxiety And it is from their affinities from their permeability that the possibility derives of mounting from one to the other and the danger of falling back of a regression to an earlier state supposedly transcended Which suggests to what degree all spiritual progress is threatened at its base For the unfulfilled seeker after deliverance for the beginner in nirvana nothing is easier nothing more frequent than to retreat toward his old terrors But when at long intervals he manages to hold fast he makes his own the exhortation of the Dhammapada Shine for yourself as your own light and during the time he adopts and follows it he understands from within those who conform to it always ENCOUNTERS WITH SUICIDE You kill yourself only if in some respects you have always been outside of it all What is involved is an original dispossession of which you cannot be conscious A man called to kill himself belongs only accidentally to this world he is in fact answerable to no world at all You are not predisposed you are predestined to suicide you are committed to it before any disappointment before any experience happiness impels you to it as much as misery does even more for happiness amorphous improbable requires an exhausting effort of adaptation whereas misery offers security and the rigor of a rite    There are nights when the future cancels out when only one of all its moments subsists the one we shall choose in order to exist no longer    The further I go the more I see my chances dwindle of dragging myself from one day to the next To tell the truth it has always been like this I have not lived in the possible but in the inconceivable My memory accumulates prostrate horizons    There exists in us a temptation rather than a will to die For it were granted to us to will death who would not take advantage of it at the first vexation Another obstacle also intervenes the idea of killing himself seems incredibly new to the man who is possessed by it he therefore imagines himself performing an action without precedent this illusion fills and flatters him and causes him to waste precious time    Suicide is a sudden accomplishment a lightninglike deliverance it is nirvana by violence    So simple a fact as looking at a knife and realizing that it depends only on yourself to make a certain use of it gives you a sensation of sovereignty which can turn to megalomania    When the idea of putting an end to it all takes hold of us a space opens out before us a vast possibility outside of time and of eternity itself a dizzying issue a hope of dying beyond death To kill yourself is thereby to compete with death to prove that you can do better than death to put one over on death and no negligible success to redeem yourself in your own eyes You are reassured you thus convince yourself that you are not the worst that you deserve some respect You tell yourself up to now incapable of taking any initiative I had no selfesteem now everything is changed destroying myself I thereby destroy all the reasons I had to despise myself I regain confidence I am someone forever       Since it is my mission to suffer I do not understand why I try to imagine my fate otherwise still less why I rage against sensations For that is what all suffering is at the start and at the end in any case In the middle of course it is something more a universe    This passion in the middle of the night this insistence on a final explanation with yourself with the elements    Suddenly your blood seethes you tremble you get up go out remind yourself there is no longer any reason to beat around the bush to procrastinate this time it will be for good No sooner are you outside than you feel almost imperceptibly a kind of relief You walk on imbued with the gesture you are about to make with the mission you have assigned yourself A touch of exaltation replaces the passion when you tell yourself that at last you have come to the end that the future has come down to a few minutes to an hour at the most and that you have decreed on your own authority the suspension of time s total Then comes the reassuring impression which the absence of others inspires everyone else is asleep How to abandon a world in which you can still be alone This night which was to be the last is the one you cannot part with you do not conceive that it might be eliminated And you would like to defend it against the day which undermines and soon submerges it    If we could change our nature become anyone else we should belong from the start to the elect Since metamorphosis is not to be realized we cling to predestination a magic word if ever there was one Merely uttering it gives us the sensation of having passed beyond the stage of questions and perplexities of having found at last the key to every deadlock    When you feel the longing to be done with it all whether weak or overwhelming you are led to reflect upon it to explain it to explain it to yourself You are especially likely to do this moreover when the longing is weak for when it is too intense it invades the mind and leaves it neither space nor time to consider or to escape it    To wait for death is to suffer it to expect death is to reduce it to the rank of a process to resign yourself to a denouement whose date decor and manner you know nothing about You are far from the absolute action Nothing in common between the obsession with suicide and the sentiment of death I mean that profound constant feeling of an end in itself of a fatality to perish as such inseparable from a cosmic background and independent of that drama of the self at the center of any form of autodestruction Death is not necessarily experienced as deliverance suicide always is it is a summum the paroxysm of salvation We should out of decency choose for ourselves the moment to disappear It is debasing to die the way one does it is intolerable to be exposed to an end over which we have no control an end which lies in wait for us overthrows us casts us into the unnameable Perhaps the moment will come when a natural death will be altogether discredited when we shall enrich the catechisms with a new formula Grant us Lord the favor and the force to end it all the grace to eliminate ourselves in time The ageold conspiracy against suicide is responsible for the congestion and the sclerosis of societies We must learn to destroy ourselves at the right moment to run joyously toward our ghost So long as we do not determine to do so we deserve our humiliations When a man has exhausted his raison d etre it is odious to persist    But this indeed is the indignity of natural death which we discover wherever we happen to look Meeting after several years someone we used to know as a child the first glance almost always suggests that some great disaster must have befallen him Leopardi  To last is to lessen existence is loss of being Since no one dies when he should we ought to call to order anyone who survives himself encourage and if need be assist him to abbreviate his days After a given moment to persevere is to assent to decay But be sure of your decline Might you not be mistaken about the symptoms Does not consciousness of decay imply a superiority to decay itself And in that case have you decayed yet How once again know if you have begun the descent how determine that moment Mistakes are certainly possible but they are of no consequence since to all intents and purposes you never die on time You drift and it is only when you flow with the current that you confess you are flotsam And then it is too late to sink of your own free will    It is comforting to think that you are going to kill yourself No subject is more restful as soon as you approach it you breathe To meditate upon suicide is almost as liberating as the act itself The more marginal I am to the moments the more the prospect of severing myself from them forever reincorporates me with existence puts me on a proper footing with the living confers a kind of standing This prospect which I cannot do without has rescued me from all my dejections has allowed me above all to survive those periods when I had no grievance against anyone when I was content Without its help without the hope it affords paradise would seem to me the worst of torments How many times have I murmured to myself that without the notion of suicide one would kill oneself on the spot The mind it engrosses coddles it idolizes it expects miracles from it Like a drowning man who clings to the idea of shipwreck    There are as many reasons to eliminate yourself as there are reasons to continue with the difference however that the latter have more seniority more solidity They weigh more heavily than the former because they are identified with our origins whereas the former the fruit of experience being necessarily more recent are both more urgent and more uncertain    The same man who says I don t have the courage to kill myself will the next moment call cowardly an exploit before which the bravest would cringe You kill yourself we are forever being told out of weakness in order not to have to face suffering or shame Only no one sees that it is precisely the weak who far from trying to escape suffering or shame accommodate themselves to such feelings and that it requires vigor in order to win free of them decisively In truth it is easier to kill yourself than to vanquish a prejudice as old as man or at least as his religions so sadly impermeable to the supreme gesture So long as the Church was rampant only the madman enjoyed the favors of the regime he alone had the right to put an end to his days His corpse was neither profaned nor hanged Between ancient stoicism and modern free thought between say Seneca and Hume suicide suffered aside from the Catharist interlude a long eclipse a dark age in fact for all those who wanting to die dared not infringe the ban on putting oneself to death    The infirmities which we have observed and analyzed lose their gravity and their strength once examined we endure them better With the exception of sadness The degree of performance which is involved in depression is inapplicable to sadness intransigent intractable sadness knows nothing of imagination whimsy With sadness there is no escape clause no flirtation And no matter how much we talk about it comment upon it sadness neither diminishes nor increases It is    The man who has never contemplated killing himself will bring himself to do so much more promptly than the man who thinks about it all the time Every crucial act being easier to perform by thoughtlessness than by scrutiny the mind virgin of suicide once it feels impelled in that direction will have no defense against this sudden impulsion it will be blinded and shaken by the revelation of a final solution which it had not previously considered Whereas the man who is suicide prone can always procrastinate a gesture which he has endlessly weighed and weighed again which he knows through and through and to which he will bring himself without passion if he ever brings himself to it at all    The horrors that glut the universe constitute an integral part of its substance without them the universe would physically cease to exist To draw the ultimate consequences of this phenomenon is not to commit a beautiful suicide The only kind which deserves this epithet is the kind which springs up out of nowhere without apparent motive for no reason pure suicide It is this suicide a defiance to all capital letters which humiliates which crushes God Providence and even Fate    A man does not kill himself as is commonly supposed in a fit of madness but rather in a fit of unendurable lucidity in a paroxysm which may if so desired be identified with madness for an excessive persipicacity carried to the limit and of which one longs to be rid at all costs exceeds the context of reason The culminating moment of the decision testifies nonetheless to no darkening of the mind technical idiots virtually never kill themselves but you can kill yourself from a fear from a foreboding of idiocy The act itself is then inseparable from the last spasm of the mind which recovers itself which musters all its powers all its faculties before cancelling itself out On the threshold of the final defeat it proves to itself that it is not completely lost And it loses itself in full and instantaneous possession of all its powers    We have unlearned the art of killing ourselves cold The ancients were the last to excel in it The suicide we conceive of is ardent feverish an inspired state as for detachment it is as convulsionaries that we dream of it Those sages who antedated the Cross knew how to break with this world or resign themselves to it without drama without lyricism Their style has been lost as well as the basis of their imperturbability a usurping Providence came to dislodge Fatum from every cranny And we rush to recover it craving support there when no other can guide or beguile us    There is nothing more profound nor more incomprehensible than desire Which is why we feel we are alive only when we despair of destroying it    Whether we do away with ourselves or not everything remains unchanged But the decision to do away with ourselves seems to each of us the most important that has ever been taken It should not be so And yet it is so and nothing can prevail against this aberration or this mystery    Having always coincided only with the interval which separates me from beings from things with the void which opens in the center of each of my sensations how could I help being amazed at seeing myself subscribe to anything whatever endorse my remarks adhere to my vacillations even my convictions So much naivete torments me and reassures me    You must be greedy for the absolute in order to envisage suicide But you can also envisage it by doubting by doubting everything It s quite natural the more you seek the absolute the deeper out of resentment at your incapacity to find it you sink into doubt which is the opposite of a quest the negative conclusion of a great crusade a grand passion The absolute is a pursuit doubt a retreat This retreat a pursuit in reverse collides when it cannot stop with extremities inaccessible to rational procedure At first it was only a method now it is an intoxication like everything which tends beyond the self To advance or to retrogress toward limits to plumb the depths of anything is to encounter necessarily the temptation of selfdestruction    On that minor Mediterranean island long before sunrise I was making my way along the path leading to the steepest cliff and thinking the thoughts of a vacationing concierge if I had that villa I d paint it ocher I d have a different fence put up etc Despite my idea I was clinging to every straw I stared at the century plants I dawdled I shrouded in digressions the urgency of my intention A dog began barking then made friends and followed me You cannot imagine if you haven t experienced it the solace of an animal coming to keep you company when the gods have turned their backs    Facing a landscape annihilated by the light to remain serene supposes a temper I do not have The sun is my purveyor of black thoughts and summer the season when I have always reconsidered my relations with this world and with myself to the greatest prejudice of both    When you have understood that nothing is that things do not even deserve the status of appearances you no longer need to be saved you are saved and miserable forever    I try without success to stop finding reasons for vanity in anything When I happen to manage it nonetheless I feel that I no longer belong to the mortal gang I am above everything then above the gods themselves Perhaps that is what death is a sensation of great of extreme superiority    Jean Paul calls the most important night of his life the one when he discovered there was no difference between dying the next day or in thirty years A revelation as significant as it is futile if we occasionally manage to grasp its cogency we resist on the other hand drawing its consequences in immediacy the difference in question seeming to each of us somehow irreducible even absolute to exist is to prove that we have not understood to what point it is all one and the same thing to die now or no matter when Though I may know that I am nothing it still remains for me to convince myself of it authentically Something inside rejects this truth of which I am so certain This rejection indicates that I partially escape myself and what in me escapes my jurisdiction and my control makes me forever uncertain of being able to dispose of myself altogether It is in this way that by everlastingly repeating the pros and cons of the one gesture that matters we reach the point of having a bad conscience about still being alive    The obsession with suicide is characteristic of the man who can neither live nor die and whose attention never swerves from this double impossibility    So long as I act I believe that what I do involves a meaning otherwise I could not do it Once I cease acting and transform myself from an agent to a judge I no longer recover the meaning in question Next to the self who is what I do there is another one the self s self who is superior to what I do for this self what I do and even what I am implies neither meaning nor reality it is as if remote events were involved events forever past whose apparent reasons we decipher without perceiving their intrinsic necessity They might quite simply not have been so external to us are they    This same perspective applied to the whole of an existence leads straight to the rumination upon the extravagance of being born at all In the same way if you were to ask apropos of any action what would be its result in a year in ten years in a hundred or a thousand it would be impossible to complete or even to commence it Every action supposes a limited vision except the action of killing yourself for this action proceeds from an enormous vision one so vast that it makes all other actions vain and unattainable Juxtaposed to it everything is futility and mockery It alone proposes a way out I mean an abyss a liberating abyss    To reckon on anything at all here or elsewhere is to afford proofs that we are still burdened with chains The reprobate aspires to paradise this aspiration disparages compromises him To be free is to rid yourself forever of the notion of reward it is to expect nothing of men or gods it is to renounce not only this world and all worlds but salvation itself it is to destroy even the notion of it that chain among chains    What matters is to combat the instinct of selfpreservation pure stubbornness and nothing else what matters is to combat that instinct by denouncing its ravages There is all the more likelihood we shall succeed when we rehabilitate suicide when we emphasize its excellence when we make it joyous and accessible to all Anything but a negative act suicide on the contrary redeems transfigures all previous actions By the most inexplicable of misunderstandings existence has been declared sacred not only is it no such thing but it is worth something only insofar as we undertake to keep it from being so It is at best an accident an accident which little by little each of us converts into a fatality When we know what to expect in its regard we blush to attach ourselves to it and we attach ourselves to it nonetheless by a long and gradual process which obliges even the most enlightened among us to take it seriously We should by a converse process reduce existence to its original state to its primal insignificance An effort neighboring on the miraculous would be required the man who made it would cease being a slave master of his days he would halt their succession when he chose his existence would be at his discretion this is because it would have rejoined its point of departure its true status that of an accident precisely    To live entirely without a goal I have glimpsed this state and have often attained it without managing to remain there I am too weak for such happiness    If this world emanated from an honorable god to kill yourself would be an audacity a nameless provocation But since there is every reason to believe that this world is the work of a subgod it is hard to see why we should go to the trouble To spare Whom Profiting greatly from the recession of faith suicide will be increasingly easy and thereby less mysterious since it will have used up its prestige as an anathema Once piquant and praiseworthy it is now becoming what can be done it is gaining ground and if it has stopped being astonishing its future on the other hand seems assured Inside the religious universe it appeared as an insanity and a betrayal the transgression par excellence How can a man believe and annihilate himself Let us fall back on the hypothesis of the subgod which has the advantage of permitting extreme gestures the radical victory over a flawed world We can imagine this creator conscious at last of his miscalculation acknowledging his guilt he desists from it withdraws and by a last twinge of elegance does away with himself Thus he vanishes with his opus without man s having had a hand in it Such would be the improved version of the Last Judgment    Suicides prefigure the faroff fates of humanity They are harbingers and as such we must respect them Their hour will come they shall be celebrated given public homage and we shall say that they alone in the past had envisaged all had divined all We shall also say that they had made the first move that they had sacrificed themselves in order to point the way that they were in their fashion martyrs had they not killed themselves in epochs when no one was obliged to do so and when a natural death was all the rage Before the rest they knew that impossibility pure and simple would one day be the lot of all instead of being a curse a privilege Precursors so they will be called and so they were even as those who conscious of the sovereignty of evil have incriminated the creation the Manicheans early in the Christian era and to a singular degree their belated disciples the Cathari The admirable thing is that this incrimination was among the latter more frequent among the people than among the lettered To be convinced we need merely consult Bernard Gui s Practica Inquisitionis or any other report of the period on the ideas and actions of the heretics Here we shall find a comforting detail some tanner s wife or say a woodcutter s at grips with Lucifer or denouncing our first ancestors as guilty of the most Satanic of all actions These sectarians or rather these visionaries so curiously disabused in the midst of their fervor endowed with the gift of scenting the diabolic snares behind all our important actions could let themselves starve to death if need be and this exploit not at all uncommon among them marked the pinnacle of their doctrine To put oneself in endura to fast to death was a practice following upon initiation its mission was to preserve the consoled from the peril of apostasy or from all kinds of temptations The disgust with the useful aspect of sexuality the horror of procreation constitutes part of the interrogation of the creation what is the good of multiplying monsters Had it triumphed and had it remained faithful to itself Catharism would have led to a collective suicide Such a success was hardly possible however advanced they were men s minds were not sufficiently ripe Even today they are still far from being so and we must wait a long time before humanity puts itself in endura Supposing that it ever does so    In the Council of  against the Bogomils those among them were anathematized who held that woman conceives in her womb by the cooperation of Satan that Satan abides there upon conception without withdrawing hence until the birth of the child I dare not suppose that the Devil can be concerned with us to the point of keeping us company for so many months but I cannot doubt that we have been conceived under his eyes and that he actually attended our beloved begetters    This sensation of being jammed for eternity of having served one s term before being born of falling too far to find anyone to commiserate with this certitude that by killing yourself you kill no one this is the temptation of the bad suicide of the one which rises up not from the melancholy according to God but according to the Devil to keep the Apostle s distinction It is also comfortlessness in its highest degree and which seems so irremediable that it would remain intact unbroached were another universe to be started up What is that brief and vehement prayer which the desert fathers recommend against lapses and terrors    Why don t I kill myself If I knew exactly what keeps me from doing so I should have no more questions to ask myself since I should have answered them all    To keep from tormenting yourself you must sink into a profound disinterestedness you must stop being intrigued by the mundane or by the beyond falling instead into the indifference of the dead How can you look at a living man without imagining him a corpse how can you contemplate a corpse without putting yourself in its place Being is unthinkable being unmans       Someone altogether good will never bring himself to take his own life This exploit requires a vein or vestiges of cruelty A man who kills himself might under certain conditions have killed others Suicide and murder belong to the same family But suicide is more refined for cruelty to yourself is rarer more complex not to mention that it includes the intoxication of feeling pulverized by your own consciousness A man whose instincts are compromised by goodness neither intervenes in his fate nor tries to forge another he yields to the one he has resigns himself and continues a stranger to exasperation arrogance and malice which together invite and facilitate selfdestruction The notion of hastening his end never occurs to his    modesty Indeed it takes a morbid modesty to submit to dying in any way except by your own hand    How to conceive that a prayer might be anything except a monologue that an ecstasy might have any value beyond itself that our salvation or our perdition might matter to a god And yet this is what you would have to be able to admit if only for one second each day    The future that precipice so fells me that I should like to see even the notion of it disappear Actually it is that notion much more than the slither into the abyss which it conceals that has me shivering in my shoes and keeps me from enjoying the present My reason staggers before everything that happens before everything that is to happen It is not what awaits me it is waiting in itself imminence as such which erodes and appalls me To regain a semblance of peace I must cling to a time without tomorrow to a decapitated time    No matter how often I rehash the formula of triple renunciation I reject this world I reject the world of the ancestors I reject the world of the gods when I measure the space separating me from sackcloth and the desert I remind myself of a fairground sanyasi    Isn t regret a sign of precocious aging If so I am senile from birth    You haven t seen to the bottom of a thing if you haven t considered it in the light of prostration    Only those moments count when the desire to remain by yourself is so powerful that you d prefer to blow your brains out than to exchange a word with someone    The hard thing for a man who has renounced halfway is to do the rest Existence doubtless burdens him but he has not exhausted his surprise at existence Which accounts for his vacillations and the remorse at having stopped in between with no opportunity to fulfill an intention conceived long ago One of renunciation s failures    It is our sufferings which give some weight to our thoughts and keep them from turning into pirouettes it is also our sufferings which make us proclaim that there is no such thing as reality that even our sufferings have none Hence they suggest a defense strategy we triumph over them by declaring them unreal by linking them to the general deception If they were endurable what need would there be of diminishing them of exposing them Since we have no other way out except to identify them with either nightmare or whim it is easiest to opt for the latter All things considered it would be best if there were nothing If something existed we should live in the apprehension of being able to apprehend it Since there is nothing all moments are perfect and null and it is indifferent whether or not we enjoy them    The only way of dissuading someone from suicide is to urge him to do it He will never forgive you for your gesture he will abandon his scheme or postpone its execution he will regard you as an enemy as a traitor You thought you were rushing to his aid rescuing him and he sees in your eagerness no more than hostility and contempt The strangest thing of all is that he was seeking your approval pleading for your complicity What did he actually expect Haven t you deceived yourself as to the nature of his confusion What a mistake on his part to turn to you At this stage of his solitude what should have struck him is the impossibility of coming to an understanding with anyone except God    We are all deranged we take for real what is not so A living man as such is mad and blind both Incapable of discerning the illusory aspect of things he sees solidity fullness everywhere If by some miracle he happens to see the truth he lays himself open to vacuity and flourishes there Richer than the reality it replaces vacuity takes the place of everything without everything it is basis and absence abyssal variant of being But to our misery we regard it as a deficiency whence our fears and our failures What is vacuity for us after all At most a diaphanous impasse an impalpable inferno    Diligent in extenuating in reducing his appetites to nothingness he has managed only to derange them to strip them of whatever was healthy was stimulating about them a thwarted undermined beast of prey regretting his former instincts His claws being blunted but not the desire to use them all his violence is turned to desolation for desolation is nothing but wounded aggression an aggression humiliated impotent to make the most of itself  He has begun by sabotaging his passions then his beliefs The process was inexorable This revelation which presided over his days to adhere to anything is to participate in infantilism or madness might be legitimate enough he may subscribe to it still it is nonetheless excruciating intolerable It permits him to endure but not to exist it belongs to those certitudes a man never gets over Contentious and quarrelsome by nature he no longer contends no longer picks fights at least no longer with others The blows once intended for them he now belabors himself with he himself is the target Himself What self There is no one left to strike no more victim no more subject nothing but a succession of actions without agent nothing but an anonymous parade of sensations    Is he released or merely wrecked Saved or merely a spook    What shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul To gain the world to lose your soul I ve done better than that I ve lost both    Whatever I attempt it will never be anything but the demonstration of a downfall patent or camouflaged For a long time I worked out the theory of the outsider the man apart from it all This man I have now become I incarnate him My doubts have materialized my negations are made flesh I live what once I imagined myself living At last I have found myself a disciple THE UNDELIVERED The more we consider the Buddha s last exhortation Death is inherent in all created things labor ceaselessly for your salvation the more we are troubled by the impossibility of feeling ourselves as an aggregate a transitory if not fortuitous convergence of elements We readily conceive ourselves as such in the abstract in the immediate we physically gainsay it as if we were faced with some unassimilable evidence So long as we have not triumphed over this organic repugnance we shall continue to suffer that illusionbased scourge which is the craving to exist That we unmask things that we stigmatize them with the name of appearances counts for nothing for we admit thereby that they harbor being We cling to anything if only we don t have to tear ourselves away from that fascination accountable for our actions and even our nature from that primal dazzle which keeps us from discerning the nonreality in everything I am a being by metaphor if I were one in fact I should remain so forever and death stripped of meaning would have no hold on me Labor ceaselessly for your salvation that is don t forget that you are a fugitive assemblage a composite whose ingredients are only waiting to come apart Salvation indeed has a meaning only if we are provisional to the point of mockery if there were the slightest principle of duration in us we should have been forever saved or lost no more quest no more horizon If deliverance matters at all our unreality is a real godsend    We should deprive being of all its attributes make it no longer the support the site of all our attachments the eternal reassuring impasse a prejudice the most deeply rooted of all the one we are most accustomed to We are accomplices of being or of what seems so to us for there is no being there is only the ersatz of being If there were a true one we should still have to release ourselves from it extirpate it since everything which is turns to subjection and shackles Let us ascribe to others the status of shades we shall separate ourselves from them all the more easily If we are mad enough to believe they exist we expose ourselves to nameless miscalculations Let us have the prudence to acknowledge that everything that happens to us every event like every bond is inessential and that if there is a knowledge what it must show us is the advantage of maneuvering among ghosts Thought too is a prejudice a shackle It liberates only at the beginning when it permits us to break certain moorings afterwards all it is capable of is to absorb our energy and to paralyze our impulses toward liberation That it can help us in no way is sufficiently proved by the happiness we feel when we suspend it Like desire to which it is related thought feeds on its own substance it likes to manifest to multiply itself At best it can tend toward truth but what defines thought is bother We think by a liking for thought as we desire by a liking for desire In either case a fever amid fictions an overexertion within nescience The man who knows has recovered from all the fables engendered by desire and by thought he leaves the current no longer consents to the deception To think is to participate in the inexhaustible illusion which begets and devours itself greedy to perpetuate and destroy itself to think is to compete with delirium In so much fever the only sensible thing is the pause when we breathe the moments of suspension when we get the better of our hard breathing the experience of the void which is identified with the totality of such pauses of such intervals in delirium implies the momentary suppression of desire for it is desire which plunges us into nescience which sets us straying which drives us to project being all around us The void allows us to erode the idea of being but it is not drawn into this erosion itself it survives an attack which would be selfdestructive for any other idea It is true that the void is not an idea but what helps us rid ourselves of any idea Each idea represents one more mooring we must free the mind of them as we must free ourselves of all beliefs those obstacles to withdrawal We shall succeed only by raising ourselves above the operations of thought as long as thought functions as long as thought is rife it keeps us from discerning the depths of the void perceptible only when the fevers of the mind and of desire diminish All our beliefs being intrinsically superficial and governing only appearances it follows that all are on the same level at the same degree of unreality We are constituted to live with them we are constrained to do so They form the elements of our ordinary everyday malediction This is why when we happen to expose them and sweep them away we enter into the unheardof into an expansion next to which everything seems pale episodic even that very malediction Our limits retreat if we have any left The void myself without me is the liquidation of the adventure of the I it is being without any trace of being a blessed engulfment an incomparable disaster The danger is to convert the void into a substitute for being and thereby to thwart its essential function which is to impede the mechanism of attachment But if the void itself becomes the object of attachment would it not have been wiser to abide by being and the cortege of illusions which follows it In order to throw off our fetters we must learn to adhere to nothing any longer if not to the nothing of freedom    Ideally we should lose without suffering from the loss our liking for beings and for things Every day we should honor someone creature or object by renouncing them Thereby we should arrive inventorying appearances and dismissing them one after the other in perpetual withdrawal the very secret of joy Everything that we appropriate our knowledge even more than our material acquisitions merely feeds our anxiety on the other hand what calm what radiance when that frenzied pursuit of possessions even spiritual ones abates It is already a serious matter to say me more serious still to say mine for that supposes an additional collapse a reinforcement of our allegiance to the world It is a consolation the notion that we possess nothing that we are nothing the supreme consolation resides in the victory over this notion as well So closely does anxiety adhere to being that it must tear itself away if it would overcome itself If it aspires to rest in God it will succeed in doing so only insofar as He is superior to being or at least insofar as He contains a zone where being is reduced or rarefied it is here that no longer having anything to contend with anxiety is freed and approaches those confines where God liquidating His last vestiges of being lets Himself be tempted by the void    The sage as the East has always known refuses to make plans never projects Hence you would be a kind of sage    To tell the truth you make plans but it revolts you to carry them out The more you brood over one the more you feel abandoning it a wellbeing which can reach the point of ecstasy Everyone lives in and on the project consequence of nescience a metaphysical confusion on the scale of the species For the awakened becoming and a fortiori every action which is inserted within it is no more than a lure a deception begetting disgust or dread What matters is not to produce but to understand And to understand signifies to discern the degree of awakening to which a being has achieved his capacity to perceive the sum of unreality which enters into each phenomenon    Let us abide by the concrete and the void let us proscribe whatever is located between the two culture civilization progress Let us brood over the best formula ever devised here on earth manual labor in a monastery    There is no truth except in physical expenditure and in contemplation the rest is accidental useless unhealthy Health consists in exercise and in vacuity in muscles and meditation in no case in thought To meditate is to be absorbed into an idea and to be lost there whereas to think is to leap from one idea to the next to delight in quantity to accumulate trifles to pursue concept after concept goal after goal To meditate and to think are two divergent even incompatible activities To abide by the void is this not also a form of pursuit No doubt but it is to pursue the absence of pursuit to aim at a goal which sets aside all the others from the start We live in anxiety because no goal can satisfy us because over all our desires and a fortiori over being as such floats a fatality which necessarily affects those accidents which are individuals Nothing of what becomes actual escapes forfeiture The void a leap outside this fatality is like every product of quietism antitragic in essence Thanks to the void we might learn to recover ourselves by climbing back toward our origins toward our eternal virtuality Does it not put an end to all our desires And they what are they taken together next to a single moment when we pursue none when we feel none Happiness is not in desire but in the absence of desire more precisely in our enthusiasm for that absence in which we would like to wallow to sink to vanish to exclaim       When the void itself seems too heavy for us or too impure we hurl ourselves toward a nakedness beyond any conceivable form of space while the last moment of time rejoins the first one and dissolves into it    Let us scour consciousness of everything it includes of every universe it drags in its wake let us purge ourselves along with perception confine ourselves to white let us forget all the colors except the one which denies them What peace once we annul diversity once we escape the calvary of nuance and are engulfed in the uniform Consciousness as pure form then the very absence of consciousness To elude the intolerable let us seek out a counterirritant a means of avoidance a region where no sensation condescends to take a name nor any appetite to be made flesh let us recover that initial repose and abolish with the past odious memory and consciousness above all our ageold enemy whose mission it is to impoverish us to erode us Unconsciousness on the contrary is nutritive it fortifies it makes us participate in our beginnings in our primal integrity and plunges us back into beneficent chaos the chaos before the trauma of individuation    Nothing matters a great discovery if ever there was one from which no one has been able to gain any advantage To this discovery supposedly a depressing one only the void of which it is the motto can give a stirring resonance only the void takes its place takes the place of everything fulfills all the irreparable into the possible That there is no self we know but our knowledge is encumbered with reservations Luckily the void is there and when the self is withdrawn the void takes its place takes the place of everything fulfills all our expectations affords us the certitude of our nonreality The void the abyss without vertigo Instinctively we incline to the self everything in us lays claim to it It satisfies our demands for continuity for solidity it confers upon us against all evidence a timeless dimension Nothing more normal than to cling to it even when we put it in question divulge its impostures The self is any living man s reflex    All the same it seems inconceivable for us once we consider the self coldly it crumbles it vanishes it is nothing more than the symbol of a fiction Our first movement bears us toward the intoxication of identity toward the dream of indistinction toward Atman which answers our deepest most secret summons But as soon as we gain a little perspective coming to our senses we abandon the supposed basis of our being turning toward the fundamental destructability knowledge and experience of which a disciplined obsession lead to nirvana to plenitude within the void    It is because it gives us the illusion of permanence it is because it promises what it cannot provide that the idea of the absolute is suspect not to say pernicious Assailed at the roots of our being utterly unfit to last perishable to our very essence it is not consolation we require but cure The absolute neither resolves our perplexities nor suppresses our ills It is merely a makeshift and a palliative A doctrine which extols it is true insofar as it confines itself to analysis insofar as it exposes appearances it inspires doubts as soon as it confronts them with an ultimate reality Once we leave the realm of the illusory and struggle to substitute the indestructible for it we skid into falsehood If we lie less with the void it is because we do not seek it out for itself for the truth it is supposed to contain but for its therapeutic virtues we make it into a remedy we imagine it will correct the mind s oldest deviation which consists in supposing that something exists    A compromised animal man has passed the stage of being content with a hope what he expects is not just another artifice but deliverance Who will bring it to him On this point the only one that matters Christianity has shown itself less helpful than Buddhism and Western speculation less effective than Oriental Why bother with abstractors deaf to our cries or with redeemers busy rubbing salt into our wounds And what is still to be hoped for from this part of the world which regards contemplation as abulia awakening as torment We need some saving shock It is incredible that a Saint Thomas should have seen in stupor an obstacle to philosophic meditation whereas it is precisely when we are stupefied that we begin to understand that is to perceive the inanity of all truths Stupor benumbs us only to awaken us the more readily it opens to us it releases us to the essential A complete metaphysical experience is nothing but an uninterrupted stupor a triumphal stupor    It is a sign of indigence to be unable to open ourselves to the purifying void the void that appeases We are so low and so entangled in our philosophies that we have been able to conceive only nothingness that sordid version of the void We have projected all our uncertainties all our miseries and terrors there for what is nothingness finally but an abstract complement of hell a performance of reprobates the maximum effort toward the lucidity available to beings unsuited for deliverance Too tainted by our impurities for it to let us make the leap toward a virgin concept such as the void is for us the void which has not inherited from taken after hell which is not contaminated by it  nothingness in truth represents only a sterile extremity only a disconcerting vaguely funereal way out quite close to those attempts at renunciation which turn sour because too much regret is mixed in with them The void is nothingness stripped of its negative qualifications nothingness transfigured If we should manage to develop a taste for it our relations with the world are transformed something in us changes though we keep our old defects But we are no longer from here in the same way as before This is why it is salutary to resort to the void in our crises of rage our worst impulses are blunted upon that contact Without the void who knows we might now be in prison or in some padded cell The lessons in abdication it teaches also invite us to a subtler behavior with regard to our denigrators our enemies Should they be killed or spared Which does more harm which gnaws deepest vengeance or victory over vengeance How decide In our uncertainty let us choose the torture of not taking revenge Such is the limitconcession we can make if we are not saints    Only the man oppressed by the universality of torment is ripe for deliverance To try to free yourself without the awareness of this torment is either an impossibility or a vice There is no gratuitous deliverance we must be liberated from something in this case from the omnipresence of the intolerable which we suffer as much in the hypothesis of being as of nonbeing since things and the appearances of things make us suffer equally But the hypothesis of vacuity offers an advantage after all it casts a clearer light over the excess of the torment over the proportions it assumes and the inanity of the cause which provokes it We always torture ourselves too much whether this world is real or unreal The majority it is true are unaware of how much they are suffering It is the privilege of consciousness to waken to the excruciating to perceive the throbbing illusion to which human beings are in thrall It is with deliverance as it is with Christian salvation some theologian in his scandalous naivete believes in redemption even while denying original sin but if sin is not consubstantial with humanity what meaning can we attribute to the advent of the redeemer What has he come to redeem Anything but accidental our corruption is permanent it is congenital The same with iniquity abusively charged with mystery iniquity is an evidence it is even what is most visible here on earth where to put things back in order would require a savior for each generation or rather for each individual    Once we cease to desire we become the citizen of all worlds and of none It is by desire that we are from here desire vanquished we are no longer from anywhere and have nothing further to envy a saint nor a specter It may happen that there is happiness in desire but beatitude appears only where every bond is broken Beatitude is not compatible with this world It is for beatitude that the hermit cuts all his moorings for beatitude that he destroys himself    Cow s urine was the only medicine monks were authorized to use in the first Buddhist communities One cannot imagine a more judicious restriction If we pursue peace we shall reach it only by rejecting whatever is a factor of disturbance whatever man has grafted onto simplicity onto his original health Nothing exposes our failure better than the spectacle of a pharmacy all the remedies desirable for each of our ills but none for our essential ill for the disease of which no human invention can cure us    If believing ourselves unique is the result of an illusion it is let us admit an illusion so total so imperious that we are entitled to wonder if we can still call it one How desist from what we shall never recover from that pathetic and unheardof nothing which bears our name The illusion in question source of all the pangs we must suffer is so deeply anchored in each of us that we can vanquish it only by means of a sudden whirlwind which sweeping away the ego leaves us alone without anyone without ourselves    Unfortunately we cannot exterminate our desires we can only weaken them compromise them We are up against the self infected with the venom of the I It is when we escape it when we imagine we escape it that we have some right to use the high words employed by the true and the false mysticism As for a fundamental conversion there is no such thing we convert with our nature Even the Buddha after illumination was only Siddhartha Gautama with knowledge in addition Everything we believe we have smothered rises to the surface again after a certain time defects vices obsessions The most patent imperfections we have corrected return disguised but as awkward as before The pains we have taken to rid ourselves of them will not however have been altogether in vain A desire long supplanted reappears but we know it has come back it no longer gnaws us in secret nor takes us unawares it dominates us subjugates us we are still its slaves true but not consenting slaves Every conscious sensation is a sensation we have unsuccessfully opposed We are not the more pained for that since its victory will have driven it from our deepest life    In each encounter we have chosen what is easiest God or His substitutes persons in any case in order to have someone to gossip or argue with We have replaced contemplation with tension thereby creating tiresomely emotional relations between divinity and ourselves Only men who seek but are unwilling to find could have become virtuosi of the inner drama The great modern discovery is spiritual malaise the quartering between substance and vacuity more precisely between the simulacre of each Whence the cult of singularity in every realm In literature a rare mistake is worth more than any tried acknowledged truth The unwonted on the contrary has no value on the spiritual level where all that matters about an experience is its depth According to the Bhagavadgita a man is lost to this world and to the other who is given over to doubt that same doubt which Buddhism for its part cites among the five obstacles to salvation This is because doubt is not depth or a search for depth but stagnation the vertigo of stagnation With doubt it is impossible to advance to arrive doubt is corrosion and nothing but When we suppose ourselves farthest from it we relapse into it and everything begins all over again It must explode for us to be able to take the path of emancipation Without this outburst which must pulverize even the most legitimate reasons for doubting we perpetuate ourselves in malaise we cultivate it we avoid the great solutions we corrode ourselves and delight in our corrosion    The passion to withdraw to leave no trace is inaccessible to anyone attached to his name and to his work and even more inaccessible to anyone who dreams of a name or a work the trifler in short Such a man if he persists toward salvation will achieve it at best only by bogging down in nirvana    We do not conceive of a bitter mystic Knowledge according to the world clairvoyant aridity excessive lucidity without an inner dimension bitterness is the appanage of the man who having cheated in his relations with the absolute and with himself no longer knows what to hold onto nor whom to turn to Bitterness is after all more frequent than we suppose it is normal everyday the common lot Joy on the other hand fruit of an exceptional moment seems to rise up out of a disequilibrium a derangement in the depths of our being so contradictory is it to the appearances where we live And if it were to come from elsewhere from further than ourselves Joy is expansion and every expansion participates in another world whereas bitterness is constriction even if infinity looms in the background But it is an infinity which crushes instead of liberating No it is inconceivable that joy should be deranged still less that it should come from nowhere joy is so complete so enveloping so marvelously unendurable that we cannot confront it without some supreme reference In any case it is joy and joy alone which allows the notion that we can forge gods out of our need for gratitude    It is not difficult to imagine the language a contemporary man would use if he were obliged to declare his opinion about the only religion which has contributed a radical formula for salvation The search for deliverance is justified only if we believe in transmigration in the indefinite vagabondage of the self and if we aspire to put an end to it But for those of us who do not believe in this what is there to put an end to To this unique and infinitesimal duration It is obviously too brief to deserve the exertion of withdrawing from it For the Buddhist the prospect of other existences is a nightmare for us the nightmare is the cessation of this one of this nightmare As for nightmares better give us another we should be tempted to cry out in order that our disgraces not end too soon in order that they have time to follow us through several lives    Deliverance corresponds to a necessity only for the man who feels threatened by an additional existence who dreads the task of dying and dying all over again For us condemned not to be reincarnated what is the use of struggling to liberate ourselves from    nothing to free ourselves from a terror whose end is in sight And what is the use of pursuing a supreme unreality when everything here on earth is already unreal Why bother ridding ourselves of something so little justified so unfounded    An increase in illusion and in torment that is what each of us aspires to each of those who have no opportunity to believe in the endless circle of births and deaths We sigh for the curse of being reborn The Buddha has really taken too much trouble to what end A definitive death what the rest of us are sure to obtain without meditations or mortifications without any effort whatever    It is more or less in this manner that our fallen man would express himself if he consented to expose his real thoughts And who would dare cast the first stone Who hasn t spoken this way to himself We have sunk so deep into our own history that we want it to be perpetuated without respite But whether we live once or a thousand times whether we own one hour or all of them the problem is the same an insect and a god would not differ in their way of considering the fact of existing as such which is so terrifying as only a miracle can be that when we linger over it we conceive the desire to disappear forever in order not to have to consider it again in other existences It is on this phenomenon that the Buddha has insisted and it is doubtful that he would have modified his conclusions if he had ceased believing in the mechanism of transmigration    To find that everything lacks reality and not to put an end to it all this inconsistency is not an inconsistency at all taken to extremes the perception of the void coincides with the perception of the whole with the entrance into the All At last we begin to see we grope no longer we are reassured we are confirmed If a chance of salvation exists outside of faith it is in the faculty of enriching ourselves upon contact with unreality that we must seek it Even if the experience of the void were only a deception it would still deserve to be tried What it proposes what it attempts is to reduce to nothing both life and death and this with the sole intention of making them endurable to us If it occasionally succeeds what more can we desire Without it no cure for the infirmity of being nor any hope of reinstating even for a few moments the prenatal joy the light of pure previousness STRANGLED THOUGHTS I Endless brooding over a question undermines you as much as a dull pain    In what ancient author did I read that melancholy was caused by slowing of the blood Just what it is stagnant blood    You are done for a living dead man not when you stop loving but stop hating Hatred preserves in it in its chemistry resides the mystery of life Not for nothing is hatred still the best tonic ever discovered for which any organism however feeble has a tolerance    Think of God and not religion of ecstasy and not mysticism The difference between the theoretician of faith and the believer is as great as between the psychiatrist and the psychotic    It is in the nature of a rich mind not to shrink from foolishness that scarecrow of the finicky whence the latter s sterility    To make more plans than an explorer or a crook yet to be infected at the will s very root    Refinement is the sign of deficient vitality in art in love and in everything    What is a contemporary  Someone you d like to kill without quite knowing how    Each moment s tug of war between nostalgia for the deluge and intoxication with routine    To have the vice of scruple to be an automaton of remorse    Terrifying happiness Veins in which thousands of planets distend    The most difficult thing in the world is to put yourself in tune with being to catch its pitch    Sickness gives flavor to want it intensifies it picks up poverty    The mind advances only if it has the patience to go in circles in other words to deepen    First duty on getting up in the morning to blush for yourself    Fear will have been the inexhaustible nourishment of his life He was swollen stuffed obese with fear    The lot of the man who has rebelled too much is to have no energy left except for disappointment    No assertion is more false than Origen s according to which each soul has the body it deserves    In every prophet coexist a craving for the future and an aversion for happiness    To want fame is to prefer dying scorned than forgotten    To remember suddenly that you have a skull and not to lose your mind over it    Suffering makes you live time in detail moment after moment Which is to say that it exists for you over the others the ones who don t suffer time flows so that they don t live in time in fact they never have    The only man who knows what it feels like to be accursed is the man who knows he would have that feeling in the middle of paradise    All our thoughts are a function of our ailments If we understand certain things the credit for it goes to the gaps in our health and to them alone    If he didn t believe in his star he couldn t perform the merest action without an effort to drink a glass of water would seem a gigantic even a deranged undertaking    What they ask you for is actions proofs works and all you can produce are transformed tears    An ambitious man resigns himself to obscurity only after having exhausted all the reserves of bitterness he possessed    I dream of a language whose words like fists would fracture jaws    To enjoy only hymns blasphemy epilepsy       To conceive a thought just one but one that would tear the universe to pieces    Only insofar as we do not know ourselves is it possible for us to realize and to produce ourselves Fruitful is the man who is mistaken as to the motives of his actions who resists weighing his qualities and defects who foresees and dreads the impasse into which the exact view of our capacities leads us The creator who becomes transparent to himself no longer creates to know oneself is to smother one s endowments and one s demon    There is no means of proving it is preferable to be than not to be    Never let melancholy assail you for melancholy forbids all good says Tauler s sermon on the Right Use of the Day The wrong use I have made of each of my days    I have repressed all my enthusiasms but they exist they constitute my reserves my unexploited resources perhaps my future    The mind staved in by lucidity    My doubts have not been able to get the better of my automatisms I continue to make gestures to which it is impossible for me to adhere To overcome the drama of this insincerity would be to renounce to annul myself    We really believe only as long as we are unaware that we must implore A religion is alive only before the elaboration of its prayers    Every form of impotence and failure involves a positive character in the metaphysical order    Nothing could persuade me that this world is not the fruit of a dark god whose shadow I extend and that it is incumbent upon me to exhaust the consequences of the curse hanging over him and his creation    Psychoanalysis will be entirely discredited one of these days no doubt about it Which will not keep it from having destroyed our last vestiges of naivete After psychoanalysis we can never again be innocent    The very night when I asserted that our dreams had no relation to our innermost life and that they derived from bad literature I fell asleep only to be the onlooker at the procession of my oldest and most hidden terrors    What is called strength of mind is the courage not to imagine our fate otherwise    A writer worthy of the name confines himself to his mother tongue and does not go ferreting about in this or that alien idiom He is limited and likes to be out of selfdefense Nothing wrecks a talent more certainly than a mind too wide open    The moralist s primordial duty is to depoeticize his prose only then to observe men    How badly nature has conceived us an old woman once said to me It is nature herself that is badly conceived I should have answered if I had heeded my Manichean reflexes    Irresolution has become virtually a mission for him Anyone at all made him despair of all his resources He was incapable of making a decision in front of a face    All things considered it is pleasanter to be surprised by events than to have anticipated them When we exhaust our powers in the vision of disaster how are we to confront disaster itself Cassandra torments herself doubly before and during the calamity whereas the optimist is spared the pangs of prescience    According to Plutarch by the first century of our era men went to Delphi only to ask trivial questions marriage investments etc  The decadence of the Church imitates that of the oracles    The naive is a nuance of vulgarity Fontenelle There are certain remarks which are the key to a country because they yield us the secret of its limits    Napoleon on Saint Helena liked to leaf through a grammar from time to time    Thereby at least he proved he was French    Sunday afternoon Streets filled with a haggard exhausted pitiable crowd rejects from everywhere vestiges of continents scum of the earth One thinks of Rome under the Caesars overrun by the dregs of the Empire Every world center is a city dump    The disappearance of animals is a phenomenon of unprecedented gravity Their executioner has invaded the landscape there is no room left for anyone or anything but him The horror of finding a man where you could contemplate a horse    Insomnia s role in history from Caligula to Hitler Is the impossibility of sleeping the cause or the consequence of cruelty The tyrant lies awake that is what defines him    A beggar s remark When you pray beside a flower it grows faster    Anxiety is not difficult it adapts itself to everything for there is nothing which fails to please it At the first excuse an eminently miscellaneous occurrence it presses in fondles taps a mediocre but certain malaise on which it feeds Anxiety is content with little enough anything will serve Ineffectual trifler anxiety lacks class it tries for anguish and falls short    How does it happen that in life as in literature rebellion however pure has something false about it whereas resignation however tainted with listlessness always gives the impression of authenticity    Squatting on the banks of the Seine several million soured souls elaborate a nightmare in common which the rest of the world    envies    What is commonly called being expressive is being prolix    His sterility was infinite it partook of ecstasy    The certitude of failing my obligations of not doing what I was born for of letting the hours go by without taking advantage of them even a negative advantage This last reproach is is not justified though boredom my running sore being precisely that paradoxical advantage    To be naturally combative aggressive intolerant and to be unable to appeal to any dogma    Confronted with this bug the size of a comma running across my desk my first reaction was charitable to squash it Then I decided to abandon the creature to its panic what was the use of liberating it Only I should so much have liked to know where it was going    An anxious man constructs his terrors then installs himself within them a stayathome in a yawning chasm    Impossible to know why an idea seizes upon us and will not let us go As if it rose up out of the weakest point of our mind or more exactly out of the most threatened point of our brain    Expert at dissimulating his pride the sage is someone who does not deign to hope    That sudden tension that sense that something is happening that the mind s fate is being decided       Madness is perhaps merely an affliction which no longer develops    Those moments when it seems impossible for us ever to disappear when life and death lose all reality when neither one nor the other can touch us yet       It is a mistake to identify dejection and thought Were we to do so anyone who felt depressed would automatically become a thinker The worst of it is he does    The experience of inanity of the void sufficient unto itself also involves such philosophic virtues that one fails to see why we should look elsewhere What does it matter if we discover nothing by this experience if by this experience we understand everything    Living is an impossibility of which I have unceasingly become aware day after day for say forty years       Memory s one function is to help us regret    I can distinctly imagine the moment when there will no longer be a trace of flesh anywhere and yet I go on as if it made no difference How define this state in which consciousness does not weaken desire in which it actually stimulates desire the way it is true the worm wakens the fruit    The continuity of reflection is thwarted and even broken each time the brain s physical presence is felt This is perhaps the reason why the mad think only in flashes    Sometimes you feel like shouting to the cidevant gods Oh exert yourselves a little just try to reexist Grumble as I will against everything that is I am nonetheless attached to it judging by these discomforts that are related to the first symptoms of being    The skeptic is the least mysterious of men and yet starting from a certain moment he no longer belongs to this world II A work cannot rise up out of indifference nor even out of serenity that sifted fulfilled victorious indifference At the height of an ordeal we are surprised to find so few works that can calm and comfort us How could they when they themselves are the product of disturbance and discomfort    Every beginning of an idea corresponds to an imperceptible lesion of the mind    On the mantelpiece the photograph of a chimpanzee and a statuette of the Buddha This proximity more accidental than intentional makes me wonder over and over where my place might be between these two extremes between man s pre and transfiguration    Not the excess but the absence of fear is morbid I think of that friend whom nothing ever frightened a woman who couldn t even imagine a danger of any kind So much freedom so much safety was one day to lead her straight to a straightjacket    In our certainty of not being understood there is as much pride as shame Whence the equivocal character of any failure We are proud of it on the one hand mortified on the other How impure any defeat    Incurable an honorific that should be applied to only one disease the most terrible of all desire    It is unjust to call imaginary the diseases which are on the contrary only too real since they proceed from our mind the only regulator of our equilibrium and of our health    Every neophyte being a spoilsport once someone gets excited over anything even my own vagaries I prepare for a rift and my revenge    Inclined toward resentment I often give in to it and brood over it and stop only when I recall that I have envied one sage or another that I have even thought I resembled him    Those moments when you want to be absolutely alone because you re sure that face to face with yourself you will be able to discover rare unique unheardof truths then disappointment and thereafter bitterness when you find that once this solitude is achieved at last nothing comes out nothing could come       At certain times instead of the brain the very exact sensation of usurping nothingness that steppe which has substituted itself for ideas    To suffer is to produce knowledge    Thought is destruction in its essence More precisely in its principle You think you begin to think in order to break bonds to dissolve affinities to compromise the scaffolding of the real Only later when the sapper s work is well under way does thought recover itself and rebel against its natural movement    Whereas sadness is justified as much by reasoning as by observation joy rests on nothing it derives from divagation Impossible to be joyous by the pure fact of living we are sad on the other hand as soon as we open our eyes Perception as such produces melancholy witness the animals Only mice seem to be gay without effort    On the spiritual level all pain is an opportunity on the spiritual level alone    I can undertake nothing without setting aside what I know Once I envisage that once I think of that even if only for a second I lose courage I undo myself    Since things continue to get worse from generation to generation to predict catastrophes is a normal activity a duty of the mind Talleyrand s remark about the Old Regime suits any period except the one in which you are living and the one in which you are going to live The sweetness in question is continually diminishing one day it will have vanished altogether In history we are always on the threshold of the worse    That is what makes history interesting what makes us hate it and be unable to detach ourselves from it    We may be sure that the twentyfirst century more advanced than ours will regard Hitler and Stalin as choirboys    Basilides the Gnostic is one of the rare minds to have understood early in our era what now constitutes a commonplace ie that humanity if it wants to be saved must return within its natural limits by a return to ignorance true sign of redemption This commonplace we hasten to say is still a clandestine one each of us murmurs it but is careful not to declare it aloud When it becomes a slogan a considerable step forward will have been taken    In everyday life men act out of calculation in their decisive choices they please themselves and we understand nothing of either individual or collective dramas if we lose sight of this unexpected behavior No one should concern himself with history if he fails to realize how rarely the instinct of selfpreservation is manifested in it Everything occurs as if the defensemechanisms functioned only in the presence of everyday dangers and failed in the face of a major disaster    Consider the face of the man who has succeeded who has struggled in any realm You will not find there the slightest trace of pity He has the stuff out of which enemies are made    For days at a time the longing to perpetrate an attack against the five continents without a moment s thought as to the means    My energy awakens only outside of time and I feel myself a veritable Hercules as soon as I transplant myself in imagination to a universe where the very conditions of action are suppressed    The horror and the ecstasy of life experienced simultaneously as though within the same moment within each instant    The quantity of exhaustion that rests in my brain    What I have in common with the Devil is bad humor I am like him crabby by divine decree    The books I read with most interest concern mysticism and dietetics Might there be some relation between them Yes doubtless insofar as mysticism implies ascesis which is to say a regimen more precisely a diet    Eat nothing you have not sown and harvested with your own hand this recommendation of Vedic wisdom is so legitimate and so convincing that in one s rage over being unable to abide by it one would like to let oneself starve to death    Stretching out I close my eyes Suddenly an abyss yawns like a well that in search of water perforates the ground with a dizzying speed Swept into this frenzy into this void endlessly begetting itself I identify myself with the generating principle of the abyss and unhoped for happiness I thereby find an occupation and even a mission    When Pyrrho conversed if his interlocutor left he continued talking as if nothing had occurred This power of indifference this discipline of disdain I dream of with all the impatience of derangement    What a friend expects are accommodations deceptions consolations all things which imply effort the labor of reflection selfcontrol The permanent preoccupation with delicacy which friendship supposes is antinatural Give me enmity or indifference so I can breathe a little    By all the emphasis I lay on my miseries past and future I have neglected those of the present which has permitted me to endure them more readily than if I had spent my reserves of attention upon them    Sleep would be good for something if each time we dropped off we tried to see ourselves die after a few years training death would lose all its prestige and would seem no more than a formality or a pinprick    In the career of a mind which has liquidated prejudice after prejudice there comes a moment when it is quite as easy to become a saint as a swindler in any line    Cruelty our oldest characteristic is rarely described as borrowed simulated apparent labels proper on the other hand to kindness which being recent acquired has no deep roots It is a belated invention and an intransmissible one Each of us struggles to reinvent it and succeeds only by fits and starts in those moments when his nature is eclipsed when he triumphs over his ancestors and himself    Often I imagine myself climbing up on the roof getting dizzy and then on the point of falling letting out a scream Imagine is not the word for I am obliged to imagine this The thought of murder must come in the same way    If you want never to forget someone to think of him constantly to attach yourself to him forever you must not set about loving him but hating According to a Hindu belief certain demons are the fruit of a vow made in a previous life to be incarnated in a being dead set against God in order to be able to meditate upon Him the better and to have Him ceaselessly present to the mind    Death is the aroma of existence Death alone lends savor to the moments alone combats their insipidity We owe death almost everything This debt of recognition which we now and then consent to pay is what is most comforting here on earth    It is during our insomnias that pain fulfills its mission that it materializes blossoms Then pain is as limitless as the night which it imitates    We should suffer no sort of anxiety so long as we have the notion of bad luck As soon as we invoke it we are comforted we endure anything we are almost content to suffer injustices and infirmities Since anything becomes intelligible thereby we must not be surprised that idiot and illuminated alike resort to it This is because bad luck is not an explanation it is the explanation which is reinforced by the inevitable failure of all the others    Once we scrutinize the merest memory we are ready to burst with rage    What is the source of that monotonous vision of ours when the ills which have provoked and sustained it are so unaccountably diverse The fact is that this vision has assimilated them and preserved only their essence which is common to them all    Chatter any conversation with someone who has not suffered    Midnight Tension bordering on epilepsy Craving to make everything blow up efforts not to explode in fragments Imminent chaos You can be worth nothing by yourself and be someone by what you feel But you can also not be worthy of your sensations    In theory it matters as little to me whether I live as whether I die in practice I am lacerated by every anxiety which opens an abyss between life and death    Animals birds insects have resolved everything long since Why try to do better Nature loathes originality nature rejects execrates man    Torment for some men is a need an appetite and an accomplishment Everywhere they feel diminished except in hell    In the blood an inexhaustible drop of vinegar to what fairy do I owe it    An envious man forgives you nothing he will envy even your embarrassments even your shames    The mediocrity of my grief at funerals Impossible to feel sorry for the deceased conversely every birth casts me into consternation It is incomprehensible it is insane that people can show a baby that they can exhibit this potential disaster and rejoice over it    You are obsessed by detachment purity nirvana and yet someone in you whispers If you had the courage to formulate your most secret wish you would say I d like to have invented all the vices    There is no point in being a monster if you are not also a theoretician of the monstrous    You have let what was best in you die More careful you would not have betrayed your true vocation which was that of the tyrant or the hermit    To turn against yourself at every opportunity is to give evidence of a great concern for truth and justice it is to indict and to strike the real criminal Unfortunately it is also to intimidate and paralyze him and thereby to make him unlikely to improve    These rages which strip you of skin and flesh reducing you to the state of a trembling skeleton    After certain nights we should change names since we are also no longer the same man    Who are you I am an alien to the police to God to myself    For years I have gone into ecstasies over the virtues of impassibility and a day doesn t pass that I don t suffer a fit of violence which unrepressed would justify the asylum These convulsions generally occur without witnesses but in fact almost always on account of someone My rages lack breeding They are too plebeian too earthy to be able to emancipate themselves from a cause    Impossible for me to deal with anything external objective impersonal unless it should be ills ie what in others makes me think of myself    The desolation expressed by a gorilla s eyes A funereal mammal I am descended from that gaze    Whether we consider the individual or humanity as a whole we must not identify to advance with to progress unless we admit that going toward death is progress    The earth is apparently five billion years old life two or three These figures contain every consolation we could hope for We should remember them in the moments when we take ourselves seriously when we dare suffer    The more we stammer the more we struggle to write better Thus we take revenge for not having been able to be an orator The stutterer is a born stylist    What is difficult to understand are fruitful generous natures always content to be working to be producing Their energy seems excessive and yet one does not quite envy them They can be anything because at bottom they are nothing dynamic puppets nullities with inexhaustible gifts    What keeps me from going down into the arena is that I see too many minds there I admire but do not esteem so naive do they seem to me Why provoke them why measure myself against them on the same track My lassitude grants me such a superiority that it seems to me quite impossible they should ever catch up    We can think of death every day and yet persevere quite cheerfully in being This is not the case if we think unceasingly of the moment of our death the man who had only that in view would be committing an outrage against all his other moments    People are astonished that France a frivolous nation should have produced a Rance founder of the austerest order of all perhaps they should be even more astonished that Italy more frivolous still should have given the world a Leopardi the most serious of all poets    Germany s drama is not to have had a Montaigne What luck for France to have begun with a skeptic    Disgusted by the nations I turn to Mongolia where it must be good to live where there are more horses than men where the Yahoo has not yet triumphed    Every fruitful idea turns into a pseudoidea degenerates into a belief Only a sterile idea preserves its status as an idea    I imagined myself more exempt from vanity than others A recent dream was to disabuse me I had just died A coffin of planks was brought You could have put a little varnish on it even so I exclaimed before belaboring the undertakers with my fists An uproar ensued Then came the awakening and shame    This fever which leads to no discovery which bears no idea but which gives you a feeling of quasidivine power power which fades once you try to define it what does it correspond to and what can it be worth Perhaps it has no relation to anything perhaps it goes further than any metaphysical experience    Happiness is to be outside to walk to look to amalgamate with things Sitting down you fall victim to the worst of yourself Man was not created to be nailed to a chair But perhaps he doesn t deserve any better    During my insomnia I tell myself as a kind of consolation that these hours I am so conscious of I am wresting from nothingness and that if I were asleep they would never have belonged to me they would never even have existed    To lose oneself in God this believer s cliche assumes a revelatory value for the nonbeliever who in it discerns a longedfor and impracticable adventure despairing as he does of being unable to stray he too into something or preferably someone    Who is superficial Who is profound To go very far into frivolity is to cease being frivolous to reach a limit even in farce is to approach extremities of which in his line any metaphysician is quite incapable    An elephant would

the start of our civilization granted himself the luxury of objectivity at the antipodes in a belated period like ours there is no longer room for anything but attitude    Alone even doing nothing you do not waste your time You do almost always in company No encounter with yourself can be altogether sterile Something necessarily emerges even if only the hope of some day meeting yourself again    So long as you envy another s success even if it is a god s you are a vile slave like everyone else    Each being is a broken hymn    According to Tolstoy we should desire only death since this desire unfailingly realized will not be a deception like all the rest Yet is it not desire s essence to tend toward anything except death To desire is to want not to die If then we begin wanting death it is because desire is diverted from its proper function it is a deviated desire raised up against the other desires all committed to disappoint whereas this one always keeps its promises To bet on this one is to be sure of winning no matter what This desire does not cannot deceive But what we expect of a desire is precisely that it deceive us Whether or not it is realized that is secondary the important thing is that it hides the truth from us If it reveals the truth it fails in its duty it compromises and abjures itself and consequently must be struck from the list of desires    Attracted though I am by Buddhism or Catharism or any system or dogma I preserve a core of skepticism which nothing can ever penetrate and to which I always return after each of my enthusiasms Whether this skepticism is congenital or acquired it seems to me no less of a certitude even a liberation when every other form of salvation blurs or rejects me    Other people do not have the feeling that they are charlatans and they are I    I am one as much as they but I know it and suffer from that    That I should continue to sabotage my powers is it not childish to chide myself for that Yet instead of flattering me the evidence of my lack of accomplishment discourages me shatters me To be intoxicated with lucidity and be no further than this I drag vestiges of dignity which dishonor me    Only a writer without a public can allow himself the luxury of being sincere He addresses no one at most himself    A full life is in the best of cases merely an equilibrium of drawbacks    When you know that every problem is only a false problem you are dangerously close to salvation    Skepticism is an exercise in defascination    Everything in the end comes down to desire or to the absence of desire The rest is nuance    I have maligned life so much that wanting for once to do it justice I find no word that fails to ring false III Sometimes it seems better to realize yourself than to let yourself go sometimes it seems the contrary And you are quite right in both cases    Our virtues far from reinforcing each other actually envy and exclude each other When we grow conscious of their warfare we begin to denounce them one by one only too pleased not to have to take any futher trouble for any of them    What we want is not freedom but its appearances It is for these simulacra that man has always striven And since freedom as has been said is no more than a sensation what difference is there between being free and believing ourselves free    Every action as action is possible only because we have broken with Paradise whose memory which poisons our hours makes each of us a demoralized angel    Our repressed prayers explode in sarcasms    We have the feeling we are someone only when we brood over some misdeed    If we make doubt a goal it can be as comforting as faith Doubt too is capable of fervor doubt too in its way triumphs over every perplexity doubt too has an answer to everything How account for its bad reputation then From the fact that it is rarer than faith less accessible and more mysterious We cannot imagine what is going on in the doubter s house

or of Freud who labels them polymorphous perverse Either would certainly have said Suffer the little monsters to come unto me    In the decision to abjure salvation there is no diabolic element for if there were what would account for the serenity which accompanies such a decision Nothing diabolic induces serenity In the Devil s vicinity we are on the contrary morose my case    Hence my serenity is shortlived just long enough to persuade me to have nothing to do with salavation Luckily I am often so persuaded and each time what peace    To get up early filled with energy and enthusiasm

what he preaches when he is conquered by his own vaticinations Henceforth a slave an automaton he will occupy himself regretting the time when a free man he announced calamities without quite believing in them when he fabricated fears for himself It is not easy to act an Isaiah and a Jeremiah sincerely Which is why most prophets prefer being impostors    Everything that happens to us everything that counts for us affords no interest for someone else it is on the basis of this evidence that we should elaborate our rules of behavior A reflective mind should banish from its intimate vocabulary the word event    Anyone who hasn t died young deserves to die    Nothing gives us a better conscience than to fall asleep with the clear view of one of our defects which till then we hadn

very moment almost everywhere thousands and thousands are dying while clutching my pen I vainly search for a word to annotate their agony    To dwell on an action however unmentionable to invent scruples for yourself and get tangled in them proves that you are still concerned with your kind that you like to torment yourself on their account    I shall consider myself liberated only on the day when like murderers and sages I have swept my conscience clean of all the impurities of remorse    Tired of being myself yet I keep praying the gods to restore me to myself    To regret is to deliberate in the past tense to substitute the possible for the irreparable to cheat by heartbreak    Delirium is incontestably finer than doubt but doubt is solider    Skepticism is the faith of what Montaigne calls undulant minds    To see nothing but words in the calumny of words is the one way to endure that calumny without suffering Dissect any remark made against yourself isolate each syllable treat it with the disdain an adjective is worth a substantive an adverb    Or else liquidate the calumniator on the spot    Our claims to detachment always help us not to ward off blows but to digest them In any humiliation there is a first and a second period It is in the second that our coquetry with sagesse is revealed to be useful    What place do we occupy in the universe  A point if that Why reproach ourselves when we are evidently so insignificant Once we make this observation we grow calm at once henceforth no more bother no more frenzy metaphysical or otherwise And then that point dilates swells substitutes itself for space And everything begins all over again    To know is to discern the bearing of illusion a key word as essential to the Vedanta as to the song to

and misery being evils for approximately the same reason the one way of avoiding them is to make yourself external to everything    When I spend days and days among texts concerned with nothing but serenity contemplation and ascesis I am filled with a longing to rush out into the street and break the skull of the first person I meet    The proof that this world is not a success is that we can compare ourselves without indecency to Him Who is supposed to have created it but not to Napoleon or even to a bum especially if the latter is incomparable of his kind    It could not have done better a remark made by a pagan about providence which no Father of the Church was honest enough to apply to God    Speech and silence We feel safer with a madman who talks than with one who cannot open his mouth    If a Christian heresy any one of them had triumphed it would not have wasted its time on nuances Bolder than the Church it would also have been more intolerant since more convinced No doubt about it victorious the Cathari would have outstripped the Inquisitors For any victim however noble let us have a pity without illusions    What remains of a philosopher is his temperament what makes him forget himself yield to his contradictions his whims reactions incompatible with the fundamental lines of his system If he seeks truth let him free himself of all concern with coherence He must express only what he thinks and not what he had decided to think The more alive he will be the more he will let himself be himself and will survive only if he takes no account of what he ought to think    When we are to meditate upon vacuity impermanence nirvana crouching or lying down is the best position It is the one in which these themes were conceived It is only in the West that man thinks standing up Which accounts perhaps for the unfortunately positive character of our philosophy    We can endure an affront only by imagining the scenes of revenge of the triumph we shall someday have over the wretch who has flouted us Without this prospect we would fall victim to disturbances which would radically renew madness    Every mortal agony is in itself curious the most interesting however remains that of the cynic of the man who theoretically disdains it    What is the name of this bone I am touching What can it have in common with me I should begin the operation all over again with another part of my body and continue until the moment when nothing is mine    To have both the taste for provocation and the taste for effacement to be by instinct a spoilsport and by conviction a corpse    After so many living men all dead how tiring to die in our turn and to suffer like them this inept fear How explain that it still persists that it is not exhausted or discredited and that we can still sustain it as intensely as the first mortal    The hermit assumes responsibilities only toward himself or toward everyone in no case toward someone He takes refuge in solitude in order to have no one in his care himself and the universe enough    If I were sure of my indifference to salvation I should be far and away the happiest man who ever lived    To come to your senses there is nothing like being forgotten No one coming between us and what counts The more others turn away from us the more they labor toward our perfection they save us by abandoning us    My doubts about

What are you doing now Would anyone have dared ask Pyrrho or Laotsu such a question We do not imagine that the questions no one could have asked our idols can be asked of us    By nature I am so refractory to the slightest undertaking that to bring myself to perform one I first have to read some biography of Alexander or Genghis Khan    What should make old age endurable is the pleasure of seeing disappear one by one all those who have believed in us and whom we can no longer disappoint    It is my delight to gloss our fall from grace I love living as a parasite of original sin    If we could make ourselves inhumiliable    Contrary to the common allegation suffering attaches rivets us to life it is our suffering we are flattered to be able to endure it it testifies to our quality as a being and not as a specter So virulent is the pride of suffering that it is exceeded only by the pride of having suffered    Determined to save the past regret represents our sole recourse against the maneuvers of forgetting What is regret in substance if not memory on the offensive By resuscitating so many episodes and distorting them at will it offers us all the versions we want of our life so that it is correct to assert that it is thanks to regret that our life seems to us at once pitiable and fulfilled    Every theoretical formula appearing in sleep interrupts its course Dreams are events Once one of them turns into a problem or ends in a discovery we waken with a start To think asleep is an anomaly frequent among the oppressed among those who in fact sleep badly because their miseries culminate in definitions night after night    We make martyrs of ourselves we create by torments a conscience and then we realize with horror that we can never get rid of it again    The discomfort that follows on a pettiness is the state most favorable to selfexamination it even identifies itself with such reflections Scarcely surprising that each time it seizes upon us we should have the impression of knowing ourselves at last    The only subversive mind is the one which questions the obligation to exist all the others the anarchist at the head of the list compromise with the

flesh for money But what can a subsidized flesh be worth In the old days we engendered out of conviction or by accident today in order to gain a subsistance allowance or a tax deduction Such excess of calculation cannot fail to damage the quality of the spermatozoa    To look for a meaning in anything is less the act of a naif than of a masochist    To become conscious of our complete our radical destructibility is salvation itself But it is to go counter to our deepest tendencies to know we are at every moment destructible Might salvation be an exploit contra naturam    Frivolous disconnected an amateur at everything I shall have known thoroughly only the disadvantage of having been born    We should philosophize as if philosophy didn t exist like some troglodyte dazed or daunted by the procession of scourges which pass before his eyes    To relish one s pain the feeling and even the expression figure in Homer though of course as an exception As a general rule we must wait till more recent times for it It is a long road from the epic to the diary    We would not be interested in human beings if we did not have the hope of someday meeting someone worse off than ourselves    Rats confined in a limited space and fed solely on those chemical products we stuff them with become apparently much nastier and more aggressive than usual Doomed as they multiply to pile on top of each other men will detest each other much more than before they will even invent unwonted forms of hatred they will rend each other as they never did before and a universal civil war will explode not because of claims but because of humanity s inability to witness the spectacle it affords itself Even now if for a single moment it glimpsed the whole future humanity would not survive that moment    The only true solitude is where we brood upon the urgency of a prayer a prayer posterior to God and to faith itself    We should keep reminding ourselves that everything that delights or distresses us corresponds to nothing that it is all quite meaningless and futile    Well I keep reminding myself of it every day and I continue nonetheless in my delight in my distress    We are all deep in a hell each moment of which is a miracle Introduction Recent developments in literary theory and continental philosophy while remaining decidedly atheistic in orientation have brought a renewed concern with the theological In the wake of studies such as Charles Taylor s A Secular Age scholars have called into question the secularization hypothesis whereby the birth of modernity in the West represented a definitive break with the religious worldview in favor of a thoroughgoing secularization of thought and practice that attempts to draw the consequences of the disenchantment of the world in Max Weber s famous phrase borrowed from Friedrich Schiller Weber   This is not to deny of course that many philosophers writers and artists maintained religious belief or a religious outlook but it is to say that the main currents of art and thought since the midnineteenth century tended to discard theological engagement in favor of new secular models of inspiration Recent continental thought however has suggested that no such definitive break occurred and that while art and thought may be atheistic in orientation it cannot be said merely to have put aside or surpassed the theological In fact modern art and thought might even be said to depend on it From the outset Friedrich Nietzsche s famous claim that God is dead and we have killed him Gay  is shot through with the traditional theological resonance of the innocent God taking on the sins of guilty humanity and dying to redeem them and Nietzsche s own writings are full of theological y resonant vocabulary from notions of transfiguration and redemption in The Birth of Tragedy to the quasibiblical prose of Thus Spoke Zarathustra This is not to say that Nietzsche s atheism is not sincere but Nietzsche s entanglement in the discourse he was trying to surpass complicates a simple division between theism and atheism and the possibility of a simple passage from one to the other A recent study of contemporary French philosophers Christopher Watkin s Difficult Atheism argues convincingly that thinkers such as Jacques Derrida Alain Badiou and JeanLuc Nancy retain more than a trace of theological heritage in their atheistic thought Watkin demonstrates the persistence of theological orientation in contemporary thought of the force of theology as a structure of thought even as this thought divorces itself from questions of religious belief and practice There is a new move in French philosophy today to come to terms with the death of God more rigorously than ever and it cannot be understood under the banner of atheism No longer can we think in terms of a monolithic atheism or of a single agenda of thinking without God for what we see developing is a plurality of perhaps incommensurable approaches to thinking after God Watkin   The term atheism itself of course establishes a relation with theism by its very semantic structure the semantics also reveal the extent to which the concept of  The Fall Out of Redemption atheism itself depends upon the theological In that sense the fact that there is no other word for atheism that does not define it in terms of theism is revealing about the difficulty of shaking off the traces and more than the traces of the theological as a structure of thought Recent work by continental philosophers from Slavoj zizek to Giorgio Agamben Alain Badiou and JeanLuc Nancy has taken up considerations of Christian theology quite explicitly In contrast to thinkers such as Michel Henry and JeanLuc Marion who work within the bounds of theism and seek to redefine it while preserving the notion of a deity zizek Agamben and Badiou have taken up within an explicitly atheistic context questions such as Pauline theology the betrayal of Judas the foundational myth of the garden of Eden early monasticism and incarnation giving these notions philosophical and sometimes political valence in ways that go far beyond simple questions of belief To judge by these writers atheism has reached a stage where it can move beyond the by turns aggressive and defensive insistence that God does not exist and engage with the import of theological y inflected thought in the contemporary world At the same time there has recently been increased attention to the pluralities of esthetic and intellectual practices typical y labeled as modern Antoine Compagnon s book Les Antimodernes identifies a countercurrent within modernity of those who take up ideas or practices typical y associated with the modern in a critical which is not always to say reactionary way From some of these writers and thinkers a paradoxical situation arises whereby those who are strongest in their critiques of aspects of modernity such as progress secularization technological development and so on are also those most readily identified with the foundation of esthetic modernity Compagnon s earlier work such as the Five Paradoxes of Modernity was also sensitive to this irony It would seem not quite accurate or at least overly reductive to call these writers antimodern given that a long tradition of the most innovative practices in the arts of the modern period find inspiration in these writers works What I propose in this study is very much in the spirit of those writers who take the theological as a major and abiding current in the modern period but who divorce it from questions of belief in anything that might be identifiable as a form of Christianity The theological as it emerges here will be of a philosophical and esthetic kind one that operates as a structure of thought sometimes in accordance with and other times in opposition to more typical y philosophical systems of thought To the extent that this gesture represents a move back toward a premodern unification of theology and philosophy it too both participates in and cal s into question the kinds of divisions of sacred and secular putatively established in the modern period Contemporary esthetic philosopher Paul Audi cal s attention to the way in which knowledge and artistic creation are inscribed in a theological framework by the move that they accomplish from the virtual to the actual Au paradis non seulement tout est possible mais la possibilite est tout ce qu il y a  Dans la mesure ou nous agissons et parce que nous sommes toujours en situation de jugement et d actualisation des possibles il est un fait que nous sommes toujours que nous sommes toujours deja expulses du paradis In paradise not only is everything Introduction  possible but possibility is all there is  Insofar as we act and because we are always in a situation of judgment and realization of possible things it is a fact that we are always that we are always already thrown out of paradise   He goes on to clarify that his use of terms such as paradise and hell is as I have been suggesting more than metaphorical but distinct from anything that could appropriately be labeled belief Paradis enfer purgatoire ce sont ici des cadres conceptuels des districts de l esprit qui permettent de situer des enjeux de conscience Paradise hel  purgatory these are conceptual frames districts of the mind that allow us to situate the stakes of consciousness conscience   My contention is that Charles Baudelaire is a key figure in the reimagining of theological discourse in a way that divorces it from a recognizable Catholicism yet retains the force of theological language as it seeks to recast the relationship between the metaphysical and esthetic questions in play in literary creation By initiating this realignment Baudelaire casts himself as neither modern nor antimodern but rather amodern just as he could be said to be an atheological writer in both of those terms the presence of the modern and the theological is retained at the same time that the terms attempt to cancel their traditional connotations The terms suggest the kinds of complications that Baudelaire and those who follow him introduce for anyone seeking to employ theological or modern as straightforward concepts that divide cultural or esthetic history into neat periods of before and after Indeed as we shall see a questioning of any neatly linear progression of time is one of the consequences of the move that Baudelaire makes in his complex engagement with the theological Reading Baudelaire through this lens allows us to give renewed attention to aspects of his work that are too easily neglected if one concentrates exclusively on the areas in Baudelaire s poetry that make him unflinchingly modern the registration of the shock of modern urban experience the complicated split subjectivity at play in his poetry and so on at the expense of a more holistic reading In teasing out these radical y innovative aspects of the modern Baudelaire Fredric Jameson dismisses the secondrate postRomantic Baudelaire the Baudelaire of diabolism and of cheap frisson of a creaking and musty religious machinery which was no more interesting in the midnineteenth century than it is today Jameson   A more compelling reading of Baudelaire would seek to do justice to the duality that is always at hand in his work not as a clearly set opposition but rather as a simultaneous duality which Baudelaire claims is itself humanity s condition as a result of the permanent and irreparable fall from grace and which plays a determinative role in Baudelaire s depiction and theorization of the modern On this view Baudelaire s Satanism is not a holdover from romanticism but rather I shall argue an ultimately futile attempt to revolt in the face of the impossibility of redemption Baudelaire s devil is no more real than his God but both function powerful y in a larger metaphysical and esthetic view that attempts to imagine what a portrait of humanity without the possibility of redemption might look like This attempt at constructing an aredemptive worldview is among Baudelaire s most innovative moves as a writer poet and thinker and the religious machinery to which he has frequent recourse is a crucial aspect of that move given the ways in which he rebuilds that machinery  The Fall Out of Redemption and assigns to it a radical y different function from the one at play in earlier writers or those invested in a secularized notion of progress This rewriting of theological discourse is what Jerome Thelot has called Baudelaire s religion without religion deprived of all authority and all teaching deprived even of any finished text L immemorial   an attempt at what Yves Bonnefoy has called the difficulty of modern poetry which is that it has to define itself simultaneously via Christianity and against it cited in L immemorial   This project of thinking and writing both by and against Christianity resonates far beyond Baudelaire into our own time and it often generates a kind of writing that situates itself beyond easily definable categories of literary or nonliterary writing between what we could call poetry and criticism Much of the writing I consider in this study lies at the liminal space between the two as esthetic nonfiction chiefly aphorism or essay or philosophical y inflected poetry Baudelaire prefigures this double status of writing when he claims in his essay on Richard Wagner that tous les grands poetes deviennent naturellement fatalement critiques all great poets become natural y fatal y critics OC   Contemporary critical theory continues this tradition of esthetical y inflected philosophical writing and often those given to such a style also take up the question of thinking by and against Christianity Foremost among these in our own time is JeanLuc Nancy in his work on the self deconstruction of Christianity It is not a question of being somehow interested in Christianity for itself or for some religious moral spiritual or saving virtue in any of the senses that the professions of Christian faith have left us with In order to end we give what remains of Christianity its leave and this is why we can maintain that it is deconstructing itself But in deconstructing itself it disencloses our thinking whereas Enlightenment reason and following it the reason of the world of integral progress judged it necessary to close itself off to all dimensions of the outside what is called for now is to break the enclosure in order to understand that it is from reason and through reason that the pressure the drive this Trieb of reason that Kant wants to uphold of the relation with the infinite outside comes about and does so in this very place Deconstructing Christianity means opening reason to its very own reason and perhaps to its unreason Adoration   Nancy s view would thus establish more of a continuum than a rupture between sacred and secularly inflected thinking The only thing that can be actual is an atheism that contemplates the reality of its Christian origins Deconstruction   but at the same time Christianity contains its own deconstruction the emptying out of its own transcendence The notion of a continuum between Christianity and atheism has implications for every branch of thought from metaphysics to ethics esthetics and politics It is my contention that the origin of this combined intellectual and esthetic project lies in Baudelaire and that the key marker of the shift away from traditional Christianity is not an affirmation of secularism but rather the removal of redemption by any Introduction  means whether divine esthetic or political as a conceptual or actual possibility In  Georges Bataille recorded in Inner Experience a conversation he had with Maurice Blanchot in which the latter identifies three aspects of the foundation of contemporary atheistic spiritual life which can only have its principle and its end in the absence of salvation in the renunciation of all hope affirm of inner experience that it is authority but all authority expiates itself  be contestation of itself and nonknowledge   With Baudelaire we have the first definitive sketch of what such a spiritual world without the possibility of redemption would look like It is an unsentimental approach to experience that while it may have moments of nostalgic longing for the comforts of older visions recognizes them as nostalgic returns rather than actual possibilities an outlook which once again will find its full flowering in twentieth century art and thought Bataille links salvation not only to nostalgia but also to an altered attitude to suffering The nostalgia for salvation responds perhaps to the increase of suffering or rather to the incapacity to bear it  The idea of salvation comes I believe from one whom suffering breaks apart He who masters it on the contrary needs to be broken to proceed on the path towards rupture Bataille   This move to a Nietzschean affirmation of suffering prefigured in Baudelaire and made explicit here in Bataille refuses nonetheless the comforts of redemption via art which Nietzsche affirms in ways that place him among theorists of redemption rather than among those such as Baudelaire who attempt to think and write beyond it The stakes are high when writers and thinkers aim to move beyond the logic of salvation toward what I will call asoteriology a paradigm that refuses to entertain the possibility of redemption as opposed to soteriology the term for the study of redemption The work of all of the writers I consider in this study could be said to be a prolonged attempt to draw out the full consequences of the move to asoteriological thinking which becomes as urgent as it is difficult given how deeply embedded in Western thought and writing the notion of redemption is I will concentrate above all on a double set of consequences metaphysical and esthetic as they play themselves out in the authors I consider To rethink salvation is ultimately to rethink the question of endings since the logic of redemption maps onto a linear sense of time and a sense of progression from a fall to a redemption This has its parallel in the progression of an essay or poem from the beginning of the exposition through a development that leads us to the sense of an ending that gives retrospective meaning to the progression of words that will have led us to where we ultimately end In other words we read while trusting that by the end of our reading there will have been meaning just as the end of linear time on traditional accounts of redemption gives meaning and completion to the development of chronological historical time and thus leads it on to its end A break with the logic of redemption profoundly disrupts this linear sense of time and its concurrent notions of development and progress and indeed a refusal of progress is a constant concern of the authors who figure in these pages A move away from linearity also forces a new relationship to time since both secular narratives of progress and Christian notions of redemption depend on a similarly linear conception of time that is necessarily disrupted when redemption  The Fall Out of Redemption is removed A Nietzschean eternal return of the same is just one of many ways to reconceive our relation to time beyond historical progress or redemption and many of the writers I consider do not adopt such a framework opting instead like Walter Benjamin for a catastrophedriven notion of a series of calamities to which one might wish to put an end but which it appears impossible to stop Thus another major concern of these writers is despair an obvious problem that emerges when redemption is removed since the traditional virtue of hope was directly linked to the notion of redemption Without the redemptive event or a secular equivalent of some kind little stands in the way of human beings succumbing to despair at the view of the world that emerges from an aredemptive standpoint Refuge in the work of art is one possibility and again Nietzsche is a major theorist of such an option but such an approach makes us fall back into redemptive logic rather than allowing us to get past it The narrative of esthetic redemption has to be refused just as systematical y as its political or religious equivalents in order to draw all of the consequences of the move beyond redemption Asoteriological writing thus values lucidity above al  This lucidity is seldom comforting Catholic philosopher Gabriel Marcel rejects the worldview contained in Emil Cioran s writing precisely on the grounds that its conclusions risk rendering life unlivable He struggled with embracing Cioran as a friend while feeling the need to reject the conclusions of his work and writes poignantly about the painful y felt divorce between my unfailing consideration for the man for my friend and the rejection of a thought to which I could not subscribe without renouncing al my reasons for living Marcel   While there can be no redemption in esthetics literary writing clearly plays a key role for the writers I consider here one of its essential functions is to serve as an experimental ground for the working through of some of the consequences of the move out of redemptive logic I have already identified how a sense of ending is troubled when the notion of redemption is refused the consequences of a new approach to endings are esthetic as much as metaphysical The refusal of redemption is played out at the level of form when writers rethink the way a literary work ends or concludes In Baudelaire this trouble with endings reveals itself both at the level of the individual poem and at the level of Les Fleurs du Mal as a whole which as I will demonstrate turns in on itself rather than progressing toward an ending that could be derived from a linear reading of the poems In fact the poems themselves in their complex system of echoes among poems from sometimes vastly different parts of the collection direct readers on to new interpretive paths that actively defy an attempt to read a linear plot in the collection all the while affirming nonetheless that there is a sense of interrelation among the parts that compose the whole Another key figure in my analysis Emil Cioran likewise complicates our sense of an ending by complicating the relation of parts to wholes this time via collections of aphorisms rather than poems Like poems in a collection aphorisms supposedly stand on their own as a unit often with a definitive conclusion that gives the individual aphorism its particular force but they also function as parts of a whole that is not necessarily meant to be interpreted according to a logic of linearity Collections of aphorisms thus have no definitive beginning or end and are thereby a particularly fruitful Introduction  genre for exploring the consequences of the refusal of redemption Their refusal of a definitive endpoint echoes their refusal of definitive logical conclusion and thus Baudelaire s lyric poetry collection and Cioran s volumes of aphorisms also perform one of the intellectual consequences of the refusal of linearity the fall into an endlessly prolongable discourse where conclusions can only be tentative in the wake of a refusal of systematic approaches to thought If the fall is irredeemable then it is also eternal as poems and aphorisms end rather than conclude and as readers are drawn into a labyrinthine artistic form Thus the form of these works echoes a key traditional theological notion of sin that of fallen humanity as incurvatus in se turned in on itself The idea stems from Paul and plays a key role in Augustine according to whom the sinful subject seeks al things for its own sake rather than relating to God as the ground and center of our existence Such an idea is ful y consonant with the atheological vision that the authors I consider shape through their works in fact a doubled selftorturing subject figures prominently in Baudelaire s writings In the face of an atheology of impossible redemption such is the portrait of subjectivity that emerges it is one of the consequences of the impossibility of redemption Fittingly such a torturous subjectivity is worked out in literary forms that can also be described as incurvatus in se not in the sense of a hermetical y closed object that attempts to cut off reference to the external world but rather in the sense of a form that turns in on itself rather than proceeding linearly to a conclusion This kind of subjectivity new in Baudelaire at least insofar as it presents itself as an incorrigible model rather than a temporary and corrigible state is not a selfactualization in and through language and thus cannot carry any esthetic redemptive value any more than it can preserve the hope of divine redemption This is a crucial aspect of Baudelaire s rupture with the romantics for whom a powerful y transformative relationship to language emerges through the poetic word As Jerome Thelot describes it it is only by language that subjectivity attains itself and freely reflects itself it is thus only by language that romantic man will redeem his era Romanticism spurred on by the end of history which is its golden age and this being what is not since it is to come and thus to be said has as its task to return into a redemptive language the analytic discourse of science which empties the world of its life and the systematic discourse of philosophical rationalism which is only the last aberration of the concept this redemptive language is named poetry L immemorial  Baudelaire and his descendants sometimes assert the power of the transformative and transcendental poetic word as his romantic predecessors did  but in the context of the Fleurs du Mal in their entirety such a faith in the power of poetry much like Baudelaire s faith in God cannot be sustained in the face of those other moments that powerfully call those into question Those moments come significantly at the end of the Spleen et Ideal Spleen and Ideal section and  The Fall Out of Redemption at the end of La Mort Death which closes the collection in other words at precisely those culminating moments when one might expect a conclusion that affirms the transformative power of the poetic word we have those poems that most powerfully question it They do so by their inability to conclude by the way in which they turn in on themselves condemned to perform that kind of doubled backonitself subjectivity into which the Baudelairean subject has permanently fallen In the face of such lucidity the moments where Baudelaire seems to aspire toward transcendence cannot help but ring hollow What then becomes of the role of poetic creation Asoteriology does not simply cancel the creative powers of the writer after all As we saw above the act of creation can survive the death of God because it retains the force of the theological account of creation even beyond the removal of God from that account As Paul Audi claims paradise cannot be desirable for the artist because everything remains there in the realm of the changeless virtual possibility as opposed to the actualization of reality and of creation that needs to separate itself from the virtuality of paradise in order to realize itself On this view artistic creation is not rendered less powerful by the removal of the redemptive possibility of poetry rather the aredemptive nature of the work of art is precisely what becomes its very condition of possibility Poetic language is thus more limited than it had been in the romantic framework because it carries no redemptive power but it also becomes a powerful vehicle for lucidity and thus a way to give form to an incurvatusinse subjectivity one that is fully aware of the illusory nature of poetic creation and embraces that very production of illusion as the condition of possibility of poetry And not just of poetry as I have been implying the question of the impossibility of redemption inextricably links esthetic concerns to questions of lived experience as those are conceptualized in writers whose work implicates both metaphysics and ethics Commenting on the work of Giorgio Agamben Thanos Zartalouids gives voice to the way redemption is linked to esthetic questions as well as modes of living in the world It is not recognition any longer that saves us but the realization that we cannot recognize ourselves in any saviorsign let alone return to it Unlearning is needed for this proposition is not to be confused with empty nihilism or other horrors that remain deep scars on the face of our degraded culture and poverty of experience  Removing redemption then does not cancel esthetic production it could in fact be said to enable it by complicating in ways at which I have already hinted and which I develop further in Chapter  the possibility of an ending and thus putting into play a condition of eternal proffering of language shaped by the writer not in any attempt at redemption of whatever by whomever but rather as an act of participation in the creative order which reinforces our move away from the purported paradise of the virtual and pushes us more solidly toward the world of the actual the only one left for us to inhabit Introduction  Released from any col usion with the salvific or the transcendent poetic language reinforces its link with the nonliterary language of criticism as I have already suggested allowing us to read across the genres of literature and criticism or theory in ways that permit us to see the thought value of the former and the creative gestures inherent in the latter Along these lines we can also profitably read interhistorical y bringing texts of different periods into dialogue with each other Such an approach is ful y consonant with these authors own rejection of linear time in favor of a more dynamic model that questions progress and thus allows us to reduce the conceptual distance that separates two chronological y distinct periods It is interhistorical reading that allows us to claim Baudelaire as in some important ways our contemporary it is also what allows fruitful readings of say Baudelaire and Cioran in similar terms despite the differences in the particularities of their historical situations And it is what allows literary theory to engage powerful y meaningful y and dynamical y with the literary texts on which it comments My contention then is that the kind of working through of asoteriological atheology that is taking place in recent critical theory is in direct relation to sometimes much older writing that is involved in the same sorts of working through of this idea In that sense Nancy s notion of the selfdeconstruction of Christianity is pertinent since it implies that the move away from a theism that still preserves a theological framework for thought is already operative in Christianity itself Such theoretical models refuse a logic of the either or that would endorse a progression from a theological to an atheological metaphysics or esthetics By rejecting such linear conceptual as well as historical moves contemporary thought gets beyond a mode of thought motivated by its conclusion this too is an important consequence of thinking beyond redemption and its messianic logic of temporal progression for thought that rejects the possibility of definitive conclusion must be asystematic and indeed all of the writers I examine here explicitly or implicitly reject systematic philosophy This refusal to conclude definitively and the impetus to proliferate the conversations that can be had across genres and across time periods encourages the kind of dynamic relation that I trace between literature and thought most immediately visible in genres such as Cioran s aphorisms but also very much at work in Baudelaire s poetry and in the other writers I examine as wel  Ulrich Baer underscores the link between meaning making and the col apse of systematicity in Baudelaire s poetry Philosophical writers may indeed vainly attempt to claim a position that will not come undone Baudelaire s poetry however generates its very sense and meaning its claim to reach through and above time from this col apse of its position   The fact that much of the work of the writers I examine sits solidly between literary and philosophical writing is in part a result of their refusal to adopt any system that would risk reducing or arresting the dynamism at work in their texts a productive result of the inability definitively to conclude that I argue is one of the consequences of moving beyond redemption By now it should be clear that I am not reading Baudelaire or any of the literary writers I consider in an attempt to tease out philosophical concepts from his writing nor to see him as an example of one or another idea that is expressed already in another writer s philosophical or  The Fall Out of Redemption theological writing Rather my argument depends on the blurring of precisely the boundaries that are implied in the distinction between literary and philosophical writing and when I claim that the consequences of the refusal of redemption are both esthetic and philosophical I would like to suggest an interdependence of the two and to demonstrate a working through of one set of consequences by way of the other The way that the writers I engage encourage us to see the literary in the philosophical and vice versa is one of their hallmark features Inasmuch as the fall out of redemption inaugurates an altered approach to temporality and to the possibility of concluding it enables a new and particular amodernity Before proceeding let us pause for a moment over this concept which is as I indicate above distinct from antimodernity Elisabeth Goodstein s subtly argued study of boredom and modernity seeks to claim boredom as a specifical y modern phenomenon different in kind from earlier experiences such as taedium vitae or acedia If rationality is the sustaining myth of modernity boredom as an everyday experience of universalized skepticism constitutes its existential reality An heir to Enlightenment the bored subject rejects the everyday world yet finds in it negative metaphysical significance the experience of boredom fosters a nihilistic dynamic that makes such disaffection seem a timeless feature of the human condition   For Goodstein the language of boredom is secular materialist and resigned to the loss of meaning   and while the bored subject makes universal claims about boredom s metaphysical significance those claims are historical y specific in ways that the modern bored subject s very boredom renders him or her incapable of seeing While I do not dispute the historical origins of this particular experience of boredom I wish to complicate the either or implied by the opposition between metaphysical and historical experience and in this I take my lead from the very authors I consider in this study those of both the nineteenth century and our own time I would begin by qualifying the notion that the language of boredom is secular If Baudelaire is to be considered a major figure in the inauguration of modern boredom as Goodstein s several references to him and to his major interpreter Walter Benjamin suggest then secular cannot be understood as opposing itself to or divorcing itself from a religious framework Baudelaire and those that follow him force us to redefine what we mean by terms such as secular while Baudelaire is at best ambivalent about God s existence and while he denies the hope of redemption and in that sense cannot be said to be Christian in orientation he and those who write in his wake retain a powerful y theological framework that structures their thought and writing even as it distances itself from questions of religious belief or practice Goodstein herself refers to the incomplete way in which religious and other metanarratives have actually been overcome in modernity  my own task will be to identify the consequences of such incomplete overcoming of the logic of redemption specifically To begin to do that we need to distinguish writers such Introduction  as Baudelaire and Cioran from what we would call secular and modern writers in a more casual sense These writers often oppose themselves powerfully to the modern world when it is characterized in terms of a secularized notion of the linear development of history that reflects progress While this might incline us to label them antimodern such a label would be no more complete a descriptor than modern since the former term implies a reactionary conservativism that is not really in line with these thinkers thought Baudelaire s lip service to Joseph de Maistre in his autobiographical notes notwithstanding  A better descriptor of writers such as Baudelaire and Cioran would be amodern a term which suggests that only by passing through the experience of the historical modern the political economic and industrial events of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries do these authors come to articulate their paradoxical position as prototypically modern writers giving voice to the very kinds of experience they often react against without in any way seeking to return to a putatively better earlier period The fact that their fundamentally ahistorical view of human history as an inevitable series of calamities and cruelties is of course historically inflected inasmuch as it arises from a particular set of historical circumstances does not alter their ability or ours to enter into the esthetic and metaphysical conclusions to be drawn from their alinear perspective For Goodstein the historicity of boredom is visible only from a position outside the nihilistic dynamic of the experience a position that permits reflection on the discursive regime in which this peculiar experience came to be   What is at stake then is our own contemporary ability to remove ourselves from the position of that nihilistic dynamic identified by the writers I engage here that is the degree to which Baudelaire could be said to be our contemporary The interhistorical reading I propose puts into dialogue writers in the nineteenth century the early twentieth century and our own day but not in the sense of contemporary writers commenting on an earlier tradition that we are now able to analyze from that outside position that Goodstein evokes Rather writers from each of these periods are implicated in the same kind of project of coming to terms with the persistent residue of a salvational framework zizek Agamben and Nancy are not ahistorical thinkers any more than Baudelaire or Cioran but they do all attempt I would argue to articulate history in terms of metaphysics while also giving voice to the way metaphysical concerns manifest themselves in historically specific ways It is this backandforth between history and philosophy as well as the hesitation between philosophy and literature that is one important site of continuity that enables an interhistorical approach to these writers an approach whereby Baudelaire may have as much to tell us about Agamben as Agamben does about Baudelaire With the impossibility of redemption comes a notion of a fall that is perpetual The writers in question here define the nature of that fall differently but always in some kind of relation to knowledge and thus to something fundamental about human interaction with the world in which we act As Elissa Marder remarks about Baudelaire the ancient fal is conceived as a fall both into time and out of it One fal s into time by becoming conscious of it but the moment one becomes conscious  The Fall Out of Redemption of time one fal s out of it because consciousness of time prevents one from being able to live in it   This allows us to take a first step toward seeing why the kind of consciousness of time that is necessary in order to historicize properly is impossible to maintain perpetual y since the very act of contemplating removes us from the time for which we hope to account thus forcing another attempt at historicizing that moment and onward toward a future of which we could only have knowledge from the perspective of the end of time which is precisely the perspective refused when we refuse the possibility of redemption The position that Marder articulates here is one developed by Cioran as wel  for whom the fal s relationship to time is double first a fall into time and then a fall from it as we shall see in more detail in Chapter  If nothing redeems the fall into knowledge and especial y for most of them knowledge via language  then human beings are always already falling and thus anything we could say about our relation to the world is necessarily limited by that condition which restricts our ability to step out of that fallen condition in order to see from some sort of Archimedean point how we might historicize this view of humanity s relation to the world in which it operates While it certainly is possible to examine such a position historical y for a moment such historicization is for the writers I consider here in the wake of the impossibility of redemption ultimately col apsible back into the philosophical concerns In other words a dynamic relationship establishes itself between historical and philosophical concerns that never allows the historical definitively to override the philosophical Putting an end to that dynamism by claiming that what appears to be ahistorical reflection on the part of these writers is actual y and only deeply historical does not reduce the force of those philosophical reflections To claim as much would be implicitly to affirm the very sort of linear model of historical progression these writers seek to deny it would be to claim that we used to think the positions we announced pretended to universality but now we know better than that To deny linear progress is to call such a view into question and to deny the comfort of settling into a definitive position that is that historicization puts an end to all universal claims The possibility of concluding is as I have suggested already and will explore in far more detail precisely what is called into question when the logic of redemption is denied It follows from the fal s logic of duality that we need to maintain the tension between universalizing and historicizing approaches where the attempt to historicize can never be permanent but rather always ready to open on to the possibility of another interhistorical conversation The realm of literary writing whether in the form of poetry aphorism or critical writing that manifests a strong literary mode is a privileged site in which to explore the ways the philosophical claims and their particular historical manifestations interact That esthetic terrain is the one that is most conducive to holding dualistic oppositions in creative tension and to enabling interhistorical reading it is thus no accident that it is the preferred mode of writing for all of the authors I explore here My first chapter lays the groundwork for understanding what is at stake in Baudelaire s refusal of redemption and sets up an interhistorical nexus by reading Baudelaire s Journaux intimes and his lyric poetry in relation to Walter Benjamin s Introduction  early writings as well as Paul de Man s work on modernity and Giorgio Agamben s recent essay on the relationship of creation to redemption The Journaux intimes provide a crucial starting place because they set out the theme of the fall without redemptive grace and its implications for Baudelaire s view of history politics and progress These notes which I read as de facto aphorisms present the theological y inflected view that he had been developing throughout his poetic career as my look back to the Fleurs du Mal which precede the autobiographical notes by over a decade will indicate What also emerges between these texts is a sense of human solidarity if not equality stemming from the irredeemable original sin that defines humanity and accounts both for particular acts and larger historical movements Original sin emerges from these texts not only as a political but also as an epistemological problem since it is linked to and even stems from the question of knowledge Baudelaire as both poet and critic helps us think through not only the epistemological but also the esthetic implications of living and writing under the condition of original sin and the condemnation to knowledge that it brings Agamben s reflections on the interdependence and simultaneity of the creative and critical act resonate with Baudelaire s and extend the poet s theological y inflected atheology of creation by claiming that redemption effectively cancels itself because since the work of creation esthetic or otherwise  is destined to pass away redemption can be operative only on itself a pure saving of nothing This selfdestruction in turn echoes de Man s notion of modernity and history condemned to being linked together in a selfdestroying union that threatens the survival of both   De Man discusses the difficulty of theorizing modernity precisely in the Baudelairean terms of the eternal and the transitory a characterization that both requires and renders impossible a movement outside the modern in order to contemplate and characterize the modern The postulation of an existence both within and outside time chimes with the notion of simultaneity that Baudelaire s cancelation of a linear notion of times engenders My analysis brings together several threads of this discussion including irony the satanic contemplation and the neant in a reading of Baudelaire s poetry that both inaugurates and in its way provides critical comment on the implicit conversation between the midnineteenth and late twentieth centuries The second chapter returns to the question of how Walter Benjamin s early writings ones not explicitly concerned with Baudelaire can be put in dialogue with the poet s prototheological stance on questions of knowledge the fal  and redemption I read the poet and the critic together in order to suggest that some of Benjamin s comments on Baudelaire in for instance his notes on the Arcades project can benefit from being read in light of the theological orientation of Benjamin s earlier writings of which more than a trace of a theological approach remains later despite Benjamin s move toward a materialist stance Theological concepts open up productive possibilities for interpreting Baudelaire but also show the limits of Benjamin s approach given his implicit concern with messianism which is precisely the kind of position that Baudelaire would reject I turn by contrast to a poet and critic active at the same time as Benjamin the Romanianborn French writer  The Fall Out of Redemption Benjamin Fondane whose magnum opus his booklength study of Baudelaire was eclipsed at the time of its publication by JeanPaul Sartre s book on Baudelaire and has since lived in the long shadow cast by Benjamin s highly influential essays on the poet Fondane foregrounds metaphysical questions more than historical ones and like Baudelaire engages theology as a mode of thought rather than a generator of belief or practice Fondane reads Baudelaire in a lineage that gives weight to early existentialist writers such as Pascal Kierkegaard and Dostoyevsky with and through Baudelaire s writings Fondane attempts to react against the hopelessness of the neant that plays such a key role in Baudelaire even while he operates in the knowledge that the attempt may be doomed to failure His existential reading of Baudelaire markedly different from Sartre s existentialist take sees value in suffering and questions how to avoid despair in the face of the lack of redemptive grace I thus argue that Fondane accounts better than Benjamin does for the refusal of the possibility of redemption in Baudelaire his reading has important implications for the ambiguous status of revolt in Baudelaire and the role of political violence a question of particular urgency given Fondane s haste to finish the Baudelaire book before being murdered at AuschwitzBirkenau The last section of the chapter extends the consideration of suffering in the wake of impossible redemption by reading Fondane s poetry of the s where we can see as we do in Baudelaire the poetic working out of a worldview that mediates between or even cal s into question the distinction between metaphysical reflection and lived experience The following chapter continues to negotiate the terrain of a poetic metaphysics and a metaphysical poetics by deepening the simultaneous engagement of esthetic and philosophical or theological concerns as they relate to the question of the end of the poem The notion of endings is common ground in both theology and poetry and in this chapter I read Baudelaire together with Giorgio Agamben in order to inquire about the esthetic consequences of an asoteriological view Agamben s notion of messianic time not as the view from the end of time but rather as the time it takes for time to come to an end has powerful consequences for the way poems end and Agamben emphasizes the paradox that poems both drive on toward their end and resist that end since the end of the poem is the moment when language fal s back into prose or into silence Here as in the other chapters I read Baudelaire not merely as a confirmation of or case study for Agamben s ideas but rather as a partner in the working through of these ideas unique in the way he allows us to extend Agamben s ideas through his approaches to bringing his poems to an end These esthetic questions are intricately entwined for Baudelaire as for Agamben with metaphysical questions and not just because death is an important subject of the last poems of Les Fleurs du Mal The role of metaphysical considerations is not just thematic but also formal for both the critic and the poet Once redemption is removed from the poet s worldview there is a profound effect on the way poems end or rather how they struggle to come to their end This chapter considers the ways poems end or resist ending in Baudelaire from formal questions of structural repetition to the sense of endless falling suggested by several of his most innovative poems and on to the poems that conclude the  and  editions of Les Fleurs du Mal In both editions the Introduction  final poems resist definitive ending by sending the reader back to poems earlier in the same section thus creating a sort of spiraling back that resists closure and with it the calming assurance of death or the neant which as I explore in Chapter  is as desirable as it is impossible for Baudelaire The struggle to accept the impossible is at the heart of Emil Cioran s engagement with the notion of redemption and it is to him that I turn in Chapter  A Romanian immigrant to Paris Cioran published his collections of aphorisms and essays in French from the s to the s One of the most distinctive stylists of his generation he was hailed by Maurice Nadeau as the prophet of the concentrational era and of collective suicide  the bringer of bad news Nadeau   His work is often philosophical in orientation but Cioran refused the label philosopher on account of the systematic nature of philosophical thought which he categorical y refused in favor of the fragment His work frequently foregrounds notions of despair and pessimism and like Baudelaire Cioran works within a Christian theological frame while refusing religious belief and practice As such he returns obsessively to the idea of impossible redemption I demonstrate that this idea grounds his writing which we can see as an extension of Baudelaire s project reconceived in light of the cultural intellectual and political history that transpired between the poet s time and Cioran s I begin by tracing Cioran s investment in the idea of lucidity about the human condition a position that brings him close to a version of nihilism but that distances him from a thinker with whom he is sometimes associated Friedrich Nietzsche With Nietzsche we have an approach to redemption that is fundamental y different from that of the other thinkers I explore since Nietzsche does affirm the possibility of redemption in the form of the esthetic I argue that such an approach which leans heavily on the notion of the transfiguration of reality merely reproduces the logic of redemption rather than allowing us to get past it This is a position that Cioran himself criticizes in his rejection of Nietzsche on grounds of the philosopher s naivete Cioran s own approach to asoteriology is linked like Baudelaire s to a selftortured subjectivity eternal y divided against itself and like Baudelaire Cioran works out the consequences of the impossibility of redemption via the form he chooses in his case the aphorism which like Baudelaire s approach to his collection of lyric poetry puts in question the notion of coming to an end and disrupts the possibility of a simple linear reading For Cioran form is an importance consequence of the fall that he theorizes and redemption becomes paradoxical y perhaps an intellectual and spiritual temptation one that we find reassuring but that not only results in falsehood but also blocks esthetic creation From this it might seem to follow that the knowledge that there is no redemption is itself a kind of redemption for Cioran especial y given the value he places on lucidity But Cioran demonstrates the impossibility of coming to rest in such an affirmation an impossibility generated by the fall itself which while it condemns us to seek knowledge also relegates us to a position of skepticism from which we cannot even affirm the salvific effect of being freed from the notion of redemption but rather will always see it as an irreparable loss Chapter  expands these considerations of Cioran in order to establish the crucial role that fiction plays in relation to lucidity and to read Cioran s work more directly  The Fall Out of Redemption in the light of his crucial middleperiod essays on the fal  In light of the despair that haunts Cioran s vision of the world it is fiction that allows us to live in the world not by providing some sort of escapist fantasy that would merely be akin to the comforts of traditional Christianity but by providing temporary nourishment by which we may continue to act in the world Cioran distinguishes between nourishing and poisonous fictions my analysis will il uminate the particular role that poetry specifical y has to play in this bridging of conceptual and lived experience Poets perhaps like Cioran himself can by their creation which emerges from an act of destruction become a model for how to mitigate between the lucidity that leads to total inaction in the world and a sense of agency that risks leading to il usion The problem of the fall as Cioran poses it is as it had been for Baudelaire and Fondane as wel  a problem of knowledge and thus literature becomes both a way of knowing our fallen state and a way of working out how we might live in what we might cal lucid delusion This doubled state is of course a consequence of the fall itself which Cioran like Baudelaire theorizes in terms of doubleness Cioran takes a step beyond other thinkers however by positing the fall itself as double it is a fall first into and then out of time The second fall repeats rather than correcting the first and thus is to be distinguished from a messianic end of time that would cancel the fall into linear time The conceptual restlessness to which we are condemned by the fall as Cioran portrays it allows him to consider a number of potential earthly forms of redemption but all of them are temporary at best and thus Cioran s thought comes to a series of provisional conclusions about an accessible redemption but cancels them all by turn in the affirmation that none of them can be definitive or eternal a move that brings us back to the notion of an eternal fal  The final chapter broadens onto ethical concerns reading Baudelaire and Cioran together in order to articulate the way in which their emphasis on the notion of irredeemable original sin while giving rise to anguish and despair ultimately uses that shared notion of despair as a kind of basis for ethical relations to others Paradoxical y these two writers often labeled misanthropes arrive at a vision of solidarity based precisely on the notion of unredeemed original sin as the common denominator of humanity one that does not allow for division between believer and atheist Christian and nonChristian or saved and unsaved The quasisecularized notion of asoteriology does give rise to a certain nihilism but it is not the nihilism of unqualified destruction or quietism Rather in our eternal falling lies a potential moment of relation to the other that is first expressed for these authors in esthetic terms For it is the work of esthetic creation that provides the model of violent action that tears us away from the pure potentiality of paradise I appeal to contemporary philosophers Paul Audi and JeanLuc Nancy and return once more to Agamben to articulate a critique of potentiality Baudelaire and Cioran provide the link between esthetic creation which is also in some sense a violent destruction of the given world and lived experience with others Through an analysis centered on Baudelaire s prose poems I demonstrate the way the esthetic rather than distancing these writers from lived experience allows them to enter it more ful y This is not a triumph over nihilism or despair but rather an articulation of the way we can live appropriately within the Introduction  very particular kinds of conclusions wrought by the theorizing of the impossibility of redemption that I will have traced throughout the book It would be misleading to label either Baudelaire or Cioran a humanist and I in no way seek to redeem or cancel their deepseated despair and tendency toward nihilism in the sense of a longing for nothingness Rather I demonstrate the way the removal of the category of redemption transforms that nihilism into a productive kind one that makes room for artistic creation and shared human experience without seeking redemption in either one and in fact guarding against the longstanding tendency to do so The book s entire cast of characters returns in the final chapter where we reach the fullest implication of my interhistorical reading That reading uses the question of redemption to avoid the pitfal s both of a Christian framework of thought and the frameworks that attempted to replace it through the long period of modernity dating from the midnineteenth century and still very much unfinished We best avoid these pitfal s I argue by shifting the ground on which we ask questions about knowledge and belief metaphysics and ethics fiction and reality Baudelaire holds the key to a new style of thinking previously underrecognized and to be sure ambiguous a thought worked out not via a system but rather in literature which becomes a model for this new kind of thought while resisting any attempt to become a new model of redemption itself  Saving Nothing Baudelaire Benjamin de Man Agamben Philosopher John Gray has claimed that if anything defines the West it is the pursuit of salvation in history It is historical teleology the belief that history has a builtin purpose or goal rather than traditions of democracy or tolerance that sets western civilization apart from all others Black   Both capitalism and communism were messianic movements using the language of reason and science but actually driven by faith   When the object of that faith is progress and when the stakes involve war and bloodshed lucidity when we are tempted to take our guiding myths as fact is particularly important and for Gray belief in progress has become a mechanism of selfdeception that serves only to block perception of the evils that come with the growth of knowledge Heresies   This critique of self deception leads Gray back to a more accurate foundational myth that of original sin fully acknowledged in its mythical status but nonetheless operative and useful as a corrective to more potentially dangerous modern myths of progress There is much is Gray s diagnosis of our contemporary world that is expressed in sometimes similar ways in Baudelaire as I will show in this chapter Baudelaire s own refusal of the idea of historical scientific or technological progress leads to an emphasis on original sin that is not simply a vehicle for a poetry steeped in devils and the macabre but rather a complex vision that seeks to articulate the intersection of metaphysics with lived experience in a way that both belongs to his particular historical moment and transcends it allowing us to establish a dialogue between Baudelaire and thinkers from other key moments when the shape and nature of modernity was called into question This first chapter lays the Baudelairean groundwork for exploring these issues concentrating in particular on the critique of progress its relation to original sin the implications of the critique of knowledge the status of the theological and most importantly the consequences of removing redemption from this nexus of ideas It is this last aspect of Baudelaire s thought which is his most original Baudelaire is the first to attempt to push to its limit a refusal of redemption this results in what is perhaps the most radical y heretical variation on Christian thought cutting as it does at the very heart of the Christian faith While Baudelaire s pessimism and antimodernity will figure in our analyses throughout the book his effort to draw all the consequences from a refusal of redemption and other thinkers travels  The Fall Out of Redemption on that path will be the most important guiding thread In answer to the all tooeasy alternative of simply substituting a different kind of redemption for the traditional theological one whether that be revolutionary political dreams or the estheticism of either art for art s sake or its later nineteenth and early twentieth century manifestations Baudelaire challenges us to consider how we might think unredemptively or rather aredemptively Let us begin by considering Baudelaire s characterization of the modern in light of his critique of progress While he is often evoked as the first modern poet and his characterization of the painter of modern life has become canonical there is also a deeply antimodern strain in Baudelaire We must resist the urge to see the two in simple opposition however and recognize that as Antoine Compagnon has remarked the antimoderns are not just any adversaries of the modern but indeed the thinkers and theoreticians of the modern Compagnon   Modernity is thus defined and even constituted by antimoderns if we take care to avoid making this term simply synonymous with vituperative cultural and political reactionaries  Part of being antimodern is positing a critical relationship to history but what makes the case of Baudelaire unique is that while working out ideas on history he is also working through new notions of time a question inextricably interwoven with theological and moral considerations Hence the particularly modern kind of antimodernism that the Baudelaire of the s and s espouses not simply ahistorical or antihistorical nor a critique of progress or revolution but a deeper pessimism that is worked out through a new relationship to writing and to theological discourse that finds one of its best expressions in the fragmentary writings of the Journaux intimes Intimate Journals  To be antimodern is at the very least to posit a critical relationship to history As far as revolutionary intervention into history is concerned we can trace a shift in Baudelaire s views from the young man eager to go to the barricades in  to the older man who claimed in a nowfamous remark in a letter that the  coup d etat by Napoleon III m a physiquement depolitique physically depoliticized me Corr    Beyond the political engagement of Baudelaire the man the writings themselves accomplish a shift from the consideration of history to the consideration of the notion of time more generally And it is a certain divided relation to time that marks for theorists such as Matei Calinescu the concept of modernity in its broadest outlines Calinescu asserts that modernity is reflected in the irreconcilable opposition between objectified socially measurable time of capitalist civilization and the personal subjective imaginative duree the private time created by the unfolding of the self Calinescu   and recognizes that although the idea of modernity has come to be associated almost automatically with secularism its main constitutive element is simply a sense of unrepeatable time a view he affirms as by no means incompatible with JudeoChristian eschatological views of history Calinescu   The question of modernity a historically minded attempt at periodization is thus complicated from the outset by a set of temporal considerations that expand questions of history to include more farreaching philosophical and theological notions And it is important to note that Calinescu s Saving Nothing  conceptual framework establishes a continuity between modernity and Judeo Christian notions of time through the category of the eschatological This is the very continuity that Baudelaire s own vision will question by canceling the possibility of redemption An important step toward articulating an antimodern notion of time is the adaptation of theological discourse that Baudelaire accomplishes in both his poetry and the Journaux intimes This is not however a simple transposition of terms from the theological to the secular realms Hans Robert Jauss cautions against such a simplistic reading claiming that if such were the case the modernity of the Fleurs du Mal would not be essential y different from the experience of empty transcendence already discovered long before by the romantic poetry of solitude Jauss   Jauss underscores that Baudelaire instead radicalized the Christian theology of original sin itself when he legitimated the antinaturalism of his aesthetics against the nature religion of romanticism producing a provocative secularization that deepens Christian notions of the fall into original sin without retaining any notion of salvation or grace This shift emerges quite explicitly in the Journaux intimes in passages such as the following Une fois il fut demande devant moi en quoi consistait le plus grand plaisir de l amour Quelqu un repondit naturellement a recevoir et un autre a se donner Celuici dit plaisir d orgueil et celuila volupte d humilite Tous ces orduriers parlaient comme l Imitation de JC Enfin il se trouva un impudent utopiste qui affirma que le plus grand plaisir de l amour etait de former des citoyens pour la patrie Moi je dis la volupte unique et supreme de l amour git dans la certitude de faire le mal Et l homme et la femme savent de naissance que dans le mal se trouve toute volupte OC   One time it was asked in my presence in what the greatest pleasure of love consisted Someone natural y responded in receiving and another in giving oneself The latter said selfish pleasure of pride and the former voluptuousness of humility All these filthy people were speaking like the Imitation of Christ Final y there was an impudent utopian who affirmed that the greatest pleasure of love was to form citizens for the fatherland As for me I said the only and supreme voluptuous pleasure of love lies in the certainty of doing evil And man and woman know from birth that it is in evil that all voluptuousness is to be found Here Baudelaire marks the passage from utopian political projects to a simultaneously wider and more pessimistic evaluation of the human condition in ways that go beyond narrow considerations of historical particularities to consider evil as the source of human motivation and pleasure Such a discussion removes us from the specificity of the city while at the same time reminding us that it is only in a modern city that such an exchange of ideas among a variety of representatives of various kinds of human stupidity can occur  The Fall Out of Redemption The historical and geographical moment thus becomes the condition of the speaker s selfremoval from that specificity the modern and antimodern conjoin as progress in the latter is facilitated by the conditions generated by the former If there is no redemption from the depths of evil to which we are all condemned to descend Baudelaire s vision nonetheless reinterprets theological discourse in political terms In a fragment which resembles the prose poem Assommons les pauvres Let s Beat up the Poor  the speaker imagines the following scenario Si quand un homme prend l habitude de la paresse de la reverie de la faineantise au point de renvoyer sans cesse au lendemain la chose importante un autre homme le reveil ait un matin a grands coups de fouet et le fouettait sans pitie jusqu a ce que ne pouvant travailler par plaisir celuici travail at par peur cet homme le fouetteur ne seraitil pas vraiment son ami son bienfaiteur  If when a man takes on the habit of laziness reverie inaction to the point of always putting the important thing off until the next day another man would wake him one morning with big lashes of the whip and beat him pitilessly until no longer able to work from pleasure he would work from fear that man the one whippingwould he not truly be his friend and benefactor The speaker concludes De meme en politique le vrai saint est celui qui fouette et tue le peuple pour le bien du peuple The same goes in politics the true saint is the one who whips and kil s the people for the good of the people   One cannot speak then of a simple removal of theological vocabulary and notions of redemption nor of a simple turn away from politics Baudelaire reintwines political and theological discourse here even more so than in the prose poem which shares certain features of this anecdote and which I shall analyze in the last chapter Rather than secularizing sainthood by emphasizing a political utopia the speaker imports religious discourse into the political by reinvesting violence with a kind of negative redemptive value and seeming to give moral value to tyranny If humanity is eternal y the same the speaker in the Journaux intimes demands that we change our perspective in order to remind ourselves that we have not in fact progressed beyond the savage state Quoi de plus absurde que le Progres puisque l homme est toujours semblable et egal a l homme c estadire toujours a l etat sauvage Qu estce que les perils de la foret et de la prairie aupres des chaos et des conflits quotidiens de la vie Que l homme enlace sa dupe sur le Boulevard ou perce sa proie dans des forets inconnues n estil pas l homme eternel c estadire l animal de proie le plus parfait  What is more absurd than Progress since man is always like and equal to man that is always in the savage state What are the perils of the forest and prairie next to the everyday chaos and conflicts of life Whether man embraces his dupe Saving Nothing  on the Boulevard or skewers his prey in unknown forests is he not the eternal man that is the most perfect animal of prey If we have not progressed beyond the savage stage then time and space can be compressed and flattened so that it no longer makes sense to conceive of them according to a linear model and the modern city becomes not so much a copy of the wild forest as its eternally equivalent substitute an eternal repetition of the same space wherever humanity finds itself Seen in this light I would argue that the form in which the Journaux intimes survives for us as a de facto set of fragments and aphorisms itself negates the notion of progress inviting us to begin anew with each fragment and to see the work as a whole whose parts do not and cannot pretend to suggest progression coherence or systematic exposition Baudelaire here carves out an antimodernist literary space of negation without redemption the work of a speaker who could be any of us representative of l homme c esta dire chacun man that is every one naturel ement deprave natural y depraved   Baudelaire s radicalization of original sin is at the heart of his antimodernism and catalyzes not only the removal from linear notions of time but also what he calls a joie de descendre joy of descending   an irremediable and eternal tendency to revel in evil Such a reversal of the good is fully consonant with traditional theology but Baudelaire pushes the boundaries of this assertion to arrive at new consequences of the logic of the fall La Theologie Qu estce que la chute Si c est l unite devenue dualite c est Dieu qui a chute  Theology What is the fall If it is unity become duality it is God who has fallen This assertion blurs further distinctions pressing the logic of duality which governs humanity Baudelaire s famous double postulation toward God and Satan and extending it to God himself who with Satan s fall from grace himself fal s into duality and thus becomes the mirror of humanity and erases the distinction between divinity and humanity Depravity is for Baudelaire inscribed in all of creation En d autres termes la creation ne seraitelle pas la chute de Dieu In other terms would creation not be the fall of God   This realization then allows a reimagination of different notions of progress Theorie de la vraie civilisation Elle n est pas dans le gaz ni dans la vapeur ni dans les tables tournantes elle est dans la diminution des traces du peche originel Theory of true civilization It is not in natural gas nor steam nor turbing tables it is in the diminution of the traces of original sin   Baudelaire borrows and extends ideas of Joseph de Maistre for whom history is synonymous with the Fall because human time is inaugurated by it Even the fall into time itself is double  The Fall Out of Redemption in structure as Elissa Marder has argued The ancient fal is conceived as a fall both into time and out of it One fal s into time by becoming conscious of it but the moment one becomes conscious of time one fal s out of it because consciousness of time prevents one from being able to live in it   This problem is at the heart of Baudelaire s supposed celebration of the modern which canonical readings see in his call to represent the contemporary But as Gerald Froidevaux has shown representing the present implies just that kind of removal from the present that Marder signals since one would have to be simultaneously in the present and outside it in order to represent it The apparently tautological formula of the representation of the present expresses the Baudelairean desire to establish the present in an intemporal duration  The modern beautiful liberates the present from its alienation from Time gratifies it with a sort of ontological solidity and confirms it as a Same that escapes incessant chronological subversion Situated at the opposite of History the Baudelairean idea of the present sets itself up in the negation of the historical present of the present that defines itself by its place in temporal continuity Froidevaux  Progress could only be attained by canceling duality including the paradoxical duality of existing within and outside the present moment and reestablishing lost Unity but whereas the earlier Baudelaire held out the possibility of such unity at least at the level of esthetic perception the later Baudelaire cancels any such hope and plants humanity firmly in the changelessness of duality and the fragmentation of which the Journaux intimes become an important il ustration The text performs the duality to which we are condemned by refusing efforts to order it or establish coherence or development within its structure thus serving as a kind of refutation of the poetics of synaesthesia announced by poems like Correspondances or Elevation What we have in the Journaux intimes as they come down to us is something that is not at al  of course a personal journal or autobiography the title Journaux intimes was imparted posthumously and never corresponded to anything Baudelaire had conceived as a journal As such what we have is not merely a firstperson subject Far from a heart laid bare that subject is a generalized persona speaking from that no time that sort of eternal present that an antimodern modernity requires and seeks In fact often only the least developed fragments segments which are not even ful sentences are the ones that evoke biographical elements of Baudelaire s life  Most often the speaking subject is removed from the specificity of a particular human person while all the same making reference to the particular times and places in which it was composed and thus serving as an il ustration of the always only partial success of efforts to transcend the present by representing it In aphoristic writing the transitional and personal present become universalized announced in an iterative present that solves the problem of representing the present Saving Nothing  by refraining from doing so eschewing it in favor of a more generalized moment of utterance Like the impossible present instant which is fragmented into ever smaller units aphorisms ask us to leap over the gaps between them assigning continuity or discontinuity to their fragments imposing order even though such an order may only be a readerly construction  In this sense each time the Journaux intimes are read as a collection the reader takes on the same role as the editors who initial y compiled the fragments into the order in which we read them now Aphorisms thus perform two kinds of separation from linear time and from other personal subjectivities and group identities as Joshua Foa Dienstag remarks Rather than emphasizing community and identity as a dialogue does aphoristic wisdom tends to separate its reader from his or her self and from the group of which he or she is a part The ironic and openly sarcastic aphorisms of the early masters of this form throw a cold light on various common social and political hypocrisies   This slippage between a general I and a particular I is in fact a crucial aspect of Baudelaire s aphoristic writing Ivresse religieuse des grandes villes Pantheisme Moi c est tous tous c est moi Tourbillon Religious intoxication of big cities Pantheism I am al  and all are I Whirlwind OC   The complexity of the blurred intersubjective relations here is revealed in affirmations such as the following Quand j aurai inspire le degout et l horreur universels j aurai conquis la solitude When I will have inspired universal horror and disgust I will have conquered solitude   Baudelaire cal s into question the very nature of the solitude he evokes here and provokes a fall into the undecidability of language in what initial y seems like a straightforward assertion Whose solitude is being conquered here At first it seems that the poet perversely conquers his own solitude by inspiring universal disgust as some kind of existential proof that he is not alone in the world but it is also plausible that the poet helps others to conquer a more universal solitude uniting everyone in their feelings of horror against the poet in which case the poet takes on a kind of sacrificial role for universal benefit Or perhaps awakening others to disgust and horror would inspire in them the same kinds of feeling already present in the poet and thus forge solidarity between them This deceptively simple statement performs the kind of vertigo implied in Moi c est tous tous c est moi and reinforces the move away from biography and toward a more generalized assessment of the workings of time and subjectivity and with important political consequences as wel  since Baudelaire cal s the notion of an individualized subject into question and favors an older model of the human person playing a role as part of a more generalized humanity La peine de Mort n a pas pour but de sauver la societe materiellement du moins Elle a pour but de sauver spirituellement la societe et le coupable The goal of the death penalty is not to save society at least in material terms It is to spiritual y save society and the guilty one   In this too Baudelaire cal s into question the modernist philosophical and political project indeed Robert Pippin identifies the question of how there could be such a being that was both in the world and the subject of a world as the distinctive modern problem in any account of the subjectworld relation xvi  Being as a subject and being in time are both called into  The Fall Out of Redemption question by Baudelaire in assertions that neither revert whol y to medieval models nor participate ful y in the postKantian formulation of the subject This particular speaking subject halfway between a specific individual and a more generalized voice derives a certain authority precisely from that liminal status a subject in the world but not of it and whose pronouncements can thus sometimes take the shape of prophecy Quant a moi qui sens quelque fois en moi le ridicule d un prophete je sais que je n y trouverai jamais la charite d un medecin Perdu dans ce vilain monde coudoye par les foules je suis comme un homme lasse dont l oeil ne voit en arriere que desabusement et amertume et devant lui qu un orage ou rien de neuf n est contenu ni enseignements ni douleur  As for me who sometimes feel in myself the ridiculousness of a prophet I know that I will never find there the charity of a doctor Lost in this nasty world bumped into by the crowds I am like a weary man whose eye sees behind him only disil usionment and bitterness and in front of him a storm where nothing new is contained neither teachings nor pain Baudelaire s prophet is stripped of the confidence or certainty that divine ordinance normally confers and is thus reduced to a selfdoubt that calls the status of the prophecy into question The prophet of antimodernity refuses progress and remains suspended in a present of intermittent lucidity alternating with a questioning of that very lucidity and of the value of announcing it This observation comes in one of the longest but most tentative fragments of the Journaux intimes and this entry is followed by a comment indicating that these remarks were off the mark yet even so je laisserai ces pages parce que je veux dater ma colere tristesse I will leave these pages because I want to date my anger sadness   This statement puts in doubt the worth of the observations that precede it claiming that their only value is biographical But rather we should reverse the claim and suggest that the remarks that Baudelaire undercuts by reducing them to a record of personal anger or sadness are in fact a key observation for the more generalized voice emerging from the Journaux intimes The present moment barely exists for the speaker who uses it only as a vantage point from which to see the present and future Moreover the future is not even distinguishable from the present since it contains rien de neuf a phrase that once again cancels linear time and returns us to the primacy of the atemporal metaphysical experience of evil in Baudelaire s record of his contemporary urban experience As Francoise Meltzer has argued Obsessed with the concept of sin and a hyperAugustinianism by way of Maistre Baudelaire writes the city less as a theoretician of modernity than as a producer of texts that argue the inevitability indeed the triumph of evil in the new urban Saving Nothing  world Though he does notoriously revel in corruption and wickedness Baudelaire s conviction that man is by definition irrevocably sinful is confirmed in his depictions of the modern capitalist industrial city Baudelaire s pleasure then lies less in the escapism provided by debauchery than in the affirmation of his deepest belief that man can never escape his sinful heritage  Acknowledging the primacy of Baudelaire s metaphysical vision over the poetics of representing the contemporary as indeed the force determining the nature of that representation allows us to avoid the temptation to see the Tableaux parisiens Parisian Tableaux and the prose poems of Le Spleen de Paris Paris Spleen as a progression on Baudelaire s part away from more abstract concerns and toward a representation of a more experiential lived reality Besides the fact that there is not a sharp chronological divide between the compositon of lyric poems and prose poems there is not a conceptual shift that would abandon the prototheological vision of evil for a more secularized vocabulary While Baudelaire does certainly fulfill his role as one of the first to give poetic voice to urban alienation and shock even that representation depends on the metaphysical vision which remains primary and operational simultaneously with the voice of the disenfranchised temporal y situated poet To affirm the contrary would be to try to impose a linear development or progression on Baudelaire s work that his own musings on the nature of time would reject By now it should be clear that I am not suggesting a return to a religious or even postsecular reading of Baudelaire As I have suggested certain theological concepts retain their full force in Baudelaire while being divorced from the question of belief and removed from anything that we could recognize as an actual y Christian framework Baudelaire is not like less remarkable antimoderns suggesting we avoid science and return to a premodern Catholic worldview While he suggests the limits of science in texts such as Le mauvais vitrier The Bad Glazier  which I shall analyze in the last chapter and provides a warning about a misplaced faith in its methods and conclusions he does not suggest that science be supplanted by a simple traditional Catholicism In fact in  Baudelaire wrote in a letter to his mother Je desire de tout mon coeur avec quelle sincerite personne ne peut le savoir que moi croire qu un etre exterieur et invisible s interesse a ma destinee mais comment faire pour le croire I desire with all my heart with how much sincerity no one but me can know to believe that an exterior and invisible being is interested in my destiny but what to do in order to believe it Corr    No matter what valence the capacity to believe may have had for Baudelaire personal y lack of belief cannot reduce the impact of the theological concepts in his writing Nowhere is such force more visible than in Baudelaire s engagement with original sin which also evinces his distance from actual Christian frameworks not only in that it consists chiefly in knowledge rather than disobedience an idea I explore in more depth in Chapter  but also in that it is never corrected by grace eliminated by baptism or triumphed over by redemption  The Fall Out of Redemption Original sin is far from a merely theological concept As Simon Critchley has recently indicated it is the conceptual expression of a fundamental experience of ontological defectiveness or lack which explains the human propensity towards error malice wickedness violence and extreme cruelty Furthermore this defect is not something we can put right which is why authoritarians think that human beings require the yoke of the state God law and the police Politics becomes the means for protecting human beings from themselves that is from their worst inclinations towards lust cruelty and violence   The high stakes of any modern or contemporary discussion of original sin immediately become apparent quickly divorced from questions of belief original sin becomes the base of a political theology that veers toward tyranny The authoritarian conclusions fall back however into a logic of redemption since beneath the concept of protecting human beings from themselves lies an implicit notion of redemption in this case via the state as Critchley goes on to note as he paraphrases proponents of original sin Because the human being is defined by original sin authoritarianism in the form of dictatorship say becomes necessary as the only means that might save human beings from themselves Human beings require the hard rule of authority because they are essentially defective   He will go on to defend anarchism as the political expression of freedom from original sin   Baudelaire s own position here is a more complicated one than is immediately apparent While Baudelaire in his most Maistrean moments sometimes seems to affirm such a reactionary politics as we saw in his defense of capital punishment above such a view is ultimately inconsistent with his refusal of redemption Here Baudelaire is a more original thinker than de Maistre who retains a logic of redemption by way of the notion of a sacrificial victim While authoritarianism provides an all too easy answer to the ontological defectiveness at hand Baudelaire cannot defend it in anything more than a halfhearted or temporary way In other words emphasis on original sin does not necessarily lead to reactionary politics it does so only when we hold on as de Maistre did but as Baudelaire ultimately refuses to do to the logic of redemption Trying to push beyond that logic is part of Baudelaire s crucial intellectual and literary project and in this he might be better situated with thinkers like Freud and Schopenhauer than with overtly political reactionaries United to this political problem is an epistemological one the premise that knowledge pace the Greek philosophical tradition is a source of evil We shall see below that the early Walter Benjamin returns to this idea with important consequences that we can apply to the Baudelairean worldview as it emerges in his verse poetry John Gray has noted the curious transformation in the contemporary world of the identification of knowledge and sin in Genesis In modern times nothing is more heretical than the idea that knowledge can be a sin  The belief that humanity advances with the growth of knowledge is at the Saving Nothing  heart of liberal humanism In many ways humanism is not much more than secular Christianity but it has suppressed the profound insights into the contradictions of human nature and the ambivalence of knowledge that were preserved in the Christian tradition At the same time it has perpetuated Christianity s worst errors Heresies   Chief among these errors is the anthropocentrism more pronounced in Christianity than in other world religions according to Gray that leads to an unreasonable and political y suspect humanism hence the link that Gray establishes here between humanism and Christianity  As we shall see Baudelaire s crucial revision of Christianity which robs it of its core doctrine of redemption in a way that allows him to restore the full emphasis on knowledge as evil also has the potential to serve as a corrective to a damaging anthropocentrism This is so not because Baudelaire affirms the animal over the human but because his pessimism imposes limits on the untenable optimism of secular liberalism as Gray here describes it By such reference to a critique of secular liberalism I do not mean to imply that a fullfledged or clearly articulated politics emerges from Baudelaire s literary or nonliterary writings Such was not his goal and attempts to claim otherwise are destined to leave unexplained exceptions to any coherent political position unaccounted for This is not to say that political conclusions cannot be drawn from his texts but like any interpretive move in the case of Baudelaire the conclusion can never be definitive on account of the very tensions and contradictions that characterize his texts What I wish to trace is above all the metaphysics that ground the kinds of tentative political conclusions we may draw from Baudelaire s texts on these grounds the poet presents a more clearly delineable position that I have already begun to identify via the refusal of redemption and its consequences both for thought and lived experience This latter consideration will come to the fore in later chapters where I attempt to delineate the ethical implications of Baudelaire s metaphysics While there are clearly political implications in many poems one only needs to think of the caricatural violence of Assommons les pauvres or the implied argument against tyranny in Une mort heroique A Heroic Death the very uncertainty of Baudelaire s own political commitments mitigates against any overconfident reading of a positive political position in these texts Indeed while there are sure indications of a shift from revolutionary enthusiasm to conservative vituperation over the course of Baudelaire s life his complex deployment of irony in his texts mitigates any definitive articulation of a political position If Joseph de Maistre did indeed teach Baudelaire to reason as the poet claims I   he does not ultimately follow him very far since sacrificial violence in the name of the redemptive act is absolutely crucial to Maistrean thinking lying at the very heart of his reactionary politics By contrast one of the few areas of Baudelaire s thought both untouched by irony and consistent throughout his writings is the refusal of redemption which effectively closes down the possibility of a direct conceptual and political lineage from de Maistre to Baudelaire This is not of course to say that it is easy to move past redemptive thinking Is it in fact possible to think beyond the logic of redemption whether by a god or art or politics or something else altogether   The Fall Out of Redemption Rethinking artistic creation in light of the logic of redemption or its impossibility has been the subject of some recent critical attention Giorgio Agamben s essay Creation and Salvation explores the secularization of religious traditions related to the interdependent acts of creation and salvation in the context of the work of the modern poet and the critic Agamben s reflections can help us articulate what is at stake for Baudelaire s criticism and poetry in his attempt to think beyond salvation In turn the world of prophets angels creators and redeemers that populates Agamben s essay can be il uminated by careful attention to the way in which Christian discourse functions in Baudelaire While the theological framework in Agamben applies chiefly to the critic in Baudelaire it is the poetry that abounds in reconceived religious structures The enabling mechanism of religious discourse is thus transferred from poetry in Baudelaire to criticism in Agamben and serves as an interesting test case of the kinds of exchanges and mutual interdependence that Agamben theorizes between creation and salvation Agamben the criticbecomepoet and Baudelaire the poetbecomecritic demonstrate the ways in which the critic s redemptive work also simulates rather than merely reproduce or describe the poet s creative work Several features of Agamben s essay invite questions about the best way to read it While its nine pages can be read continuously it is divided not so much into sections as into nine pagelong propositions or theses that could also stand independently as variations on a theme Another notable feature of the essay is its willful lack of contextualization within any larger critical conversation In this essay that offers a meditation on the act of criticism Agamben writes without footnotes implicitly proposing an ahistorical intervention that blends well with the nonlinear temporality that his reflections on creation and redemption as perpetual and simultaneous acts imply Agamben thus by flattening critical time demonstrating the interdependence of the creative and critical act and refraining from limiting the critical field by identifying fellow critical interlocutors invites dialogue with creators and critics from other periods who have considered questions of the relationship of creation to salvation in the context of literary production and interpretation My own attempt to read Agamben and Baudelaire together will pass through two other critics between Baudelaire s time and Agamben s the early Benjamin and Paul de Man What follows is an attempt to interhistoricize Agamben s essay in a way faithful to the kind of reading he suggests via his own ahistorical critical intervention in the Creation and Salvation essay After considering in the first half of his essay the role of the prophet in several world religious traditions Agamben establishes what at first appears to be a straightforward secularization hypothesis whereby creation and salvation have been transformed into nonreligious domains In modern culture philosophy and criticism have inherited the prophetic work of salvation that formerly had been entrusted to exegesis poetry technology and art are the inheritors of the angelic work of creation Through the process of secularization of the religious tradition however these disciplines have progressively lost all memory of the relationship that had previously linked them Nudities  Saving Nothing  Agamben s essay attempts to restore the memory of the link between creation and salvation by rethinking the relationship between literature and criticism in ways I shall trace below but from the outset I would inquire whether the secularization of these concepts was as complete as Agamben implies If we are to take for instance the concept of political theology seriously we need to rethink a simple secularization thesis whereby new concepts come to replace the old without remainder leaving us with nostalgia for a time when criticism and poetry were interconnected in ways we find it difficult now to fathom Agamben goes on to attempt reading creation and salvation together claiming that inasmuch as they represent the two powers of a single God they are secretly conjoined   and necessarily so since a critical or philosophical work that does not possess some sort of an essential relationship with creation is condemned to pointless idling just as a work of art or poetry that does not contain within it a critical exigency is destined for oblivion    Agamben creates an altered myth of lost paradise where today criticism and literature just like their homologous pair salvation and creation search desperately for a meeting point where their lost unity can be rediscovered They do this by exchanging their roles which nevertheless remain implacably divided   This is not restoration of lost primeval unity then but rather an exchange where one becomes the other as they exchange roles Later in the essay however Agamben asserts the ultimate impossibility of salvation Since the created being cannot but be lost   turned into a memory or ultimately as is the fate of all things destroyed it therefore cannot be saved nor can the created being s potentiality Rather creation and potentiality are rendered indistinguishable The resulting consequence is that the ultimate figure of human and divine action appears where creation and salvation coincide in the unsavable   Following upon the logic of impossible salvation Agamben asserts that salvation unlike creation which is bound to be destroyed is eternal but since it has survived creation its exigency is lost in the unsavable Born from a creation that is left pending it ends up as an inscrutable salvation that no longer has an objective   Salvation remains as a pure but useless notion given that it cannot have an object on which to act A crucial point of entry into the complex web of concepts that Agamben weaves is a consideration of time What Agamben effects in his essay is a shift from eternity to simultaneity He eliminates the possibility of creation s eternity as we have seen and retains salvation only as a potentiality Redemption is nothing other than a potentiality to create that remains pending that turns on itself and saves itself But what is the meaning of saving in this context After al  there is nothing in creation that is not ultimately destined to be lost   What remains however is the notion of simultaneity of creation and salvation if they once were as Agamben argues indistinguishable and copresent then it no longer makes sense to speak of creation preceding redemption It is here that we need to ask an important question about Agamben s own temporal schema he claims as I have noted that literature and criticism have progressively lost all memory of the relationship that had previously linked them so intimately to one another  but also claims that we have belated knowledge of the intimate connections between creation and redemption In other words Agamben s essay posits simultaneously the possibility and impossibility of  The Fall Out of Redemption perceiving creation and salvation together This simultaneous postulation is rendered possible by the form of Agamben s essay itself in its numbered sections that invite us to read them sequential y or cumulatively even though each can be read on its own terms related to the other sections by its thematic concerns but not by the linear progression of a conventional argument Religious discourse operates here neither in a traditional Christian or Jewish or Islamic frame nor as a source for ideas which will then be simply secularized but rather as an enabling mechanism for rethinking the modern since it is at the very least implied that the separability of creation and salvation and by extension literature and criticism is a modern phenomenon Agamben cites Dante as an example of a writer for whom the literature criticism distinction is not yet operable Religious discourse retains more than a simply haunting presence for writers like Agamben who draw on figures such as prophets and angels while clearly not carrying the same force of belief that this discourse may have had for premoderns Here Agamben operates in a line of poets and critics that goes far back within modernity Baudelaire s poetry and criticism set the stage in important ways for a strain of critical discourse about redemption and modernity that recurs regularly throughout the twentieth century and beyond Reading Baudelaire and Agamben together along with Benjamin and de Man highlights a simultaneity of thought among these writers a notion that flattens time in a decidedly amodern way by collapsing conventional distinctions of historical time in order to focus on continuity This notion of chronological simultaneity can be usefully expanded to analyze the coexistence of creation and salvation and by Agamben s further extension of literature and criticism There are many fruitful points of intersection between Baudelaire and the Agamben of the Creation and Salvation essay beginning with Baudelaire s formulation of the nonmutually exclusive relationship between poet and critic In his essay on Richard Wagner Baudelaire declares that tous les grands poetes deviennent naturellement fatalement critiques All great poets become naturally fatally critics and adds Je plains les poetes que guide le seul instinct je les crois incomplets Il serait prodigieux qu un critique devint poete et il est impossible qu un poete ne contienne pas un critique I pity the poets guided only by instinct I think they are incomplete It would be prodigious if a critic were to become a poet and it is impossible that a poet not contain a critic OC   Baudelaire here defies Agamben s assertion that criticism and literature once united came to be perceived as distinct activities for while Baudelaire affirms the unity of poet and critic it is in a onesided way since the poet contains the critic whereas the critic cannot aspire to the status of the poet In other words Baudelaire s description depends on the dichotomy it calls into question in the case of the poet In order for us to understand that the complete poet includes the critic but not vice versa we need to have the kind of split between poet and critic that Agamben describes without retaining his historical narrative of a move from unity to division Agamben s link between the categories of poet critic and creation salvation proves fruitful here since Baudelaire s assertion about the poetascritic remains ambiguous as to Saving Nothing  whether the poet acts as critic only when writing criticism or whether the poet is most effective as critic by writing poetry If we follow a long strain of twentiethcentury commentators stretching back at least as far as Heidegger literature qua literature holds crucial insights into questions traditionally pursued by philosophy and that cannot be expressed any other way except as literature Therefore the poet as Baudelaire describes him could very well be seen as acting as a critic in the sense of interpreter through the writing of poetry thus participating in the simultaneous act of creation and redemption that Agamben describes eliminating the temporal distance between those two acts at the same time as he eliminates the need for the role of critic and poet to be embodied by different individuals We recall Agamben s characterization of redemption as nothing other than a potentiality to create that remains pending that turns on itself and saves itself   even if there is nothing that can in fact be saved Here there is resonance with Baudelaire s description of the modern artist as the one who is able to tirer l eternel du transitoire to draw out the eternal from the transitory OC   This formulation suspends the modern between the immediate present and the atemporal in a way that allows us to make more of a link than is sometimes acknowledged between Baudelaire s theologically inflected poetry and his writing of the modern city in the Tableaux parisiens and the prose poems which has captured the lion s share of recent critical attention to Baudelaire via the long legacy of Walter Benjamin s analysis of urban experience in Baudelaire To complicate the picture by seeing more of a connection between the metaphysical and the urban Baudelaire is to pose important questions about the nature of time and modernity in Baudelaire s conception of artistic production and criticism Given that his famous comments about the eternal and the transitory are offered almost in passing in an essay devoted to an analysis of the style and subjects of Constantin Guys many critics have attempted to flesh out Baudelaire s theory of modernity antimodernity history or theology as those are suggested in the tension between the eternal and the transitory Among those critics is Paul de Man in his essay Literary History and Literary Modernity which begins as a reading of Nietzsche but then turns to consider questions of modernity and history that are pertinent to our analysis De Man underscores the problem of temporality when addressing the modern precisely because of the impossibility of thinking the present moment as one is experiencing it The spontaneity of being modern conflicts with the claim to think and write about modernity it is not at all certain that literature and modernity are in any way compatible concepts de Man   His elaboration of this idea questions the same split that Agamben evokes between the creative and the critical Even though the term modernity would have appeared in manifestoes rather than learned articles writes de Man this does not mean that we can divide the twentieth century into two parts a creative part that was actual y modern and a reflective or critical part that feeds on this modernity in the manner of a parasite   De Man s reading of Nietzsche works through the opposition between the eternal and the transitory establishing that it is a temporal experience of human mutability historical in the  The Fall Out of Redemption deepest sense of the term in that it implies the necessary experience of any present as a passing experience that makes the past irrevocable and unforgettable because it is inseparable from any present or future    The impossibility of stepping outside time in order to seize the present cancels the standard notion of linear time by showing the necessary connection among past present and future Nietzsche s notion of the eternal return is one way of conceiving such an ahistorical sense of historicity Agamben s notion of simultaneity of creation and redemption is another along with Baudelaire s proposal that the artist and presumably the critic as wel  can draw the eternal from the transitory On this view the transitory disappears in the eternal because of the impossibility of accounting for the transitory in the immediacy of its moment which is another way of expressing perhaps contra Baudelaire the necessity and impossibility of being both poet and critic except if we abandon a linear model of time Agamben s interdependent and simultaneous relationship between creation and redemption is prefigured in de Man s comments on modernity and history which relate to each other in a curiously contradictory way that goes beyond antithesis or opposition Modernity and history seem condemned to being linked together in a selfdestroying union that threatens the survival of both   We cannot view the present as present thus we require an eternal y recuperative act in order to save that which as Agamben reminds us is destined to be destroyed anyway leaving the redemptive act without an object De Man identifies a similar impasse in Baudelaire s own conception of the artist as critic As soon as Baudelaire has to replace the single instant of invention conceived as an act by a successive movement that involves at least two distinct moments he enters into a world that assumes the depths and complications of an articulated time an interdependence between past and future that prevents any present from ever coming into being    Recast in the theological language that Baudelaire prefers in his poetry he has fallen into the unavoidable consequence of original sin the fall into a linear time that renders impossible the very simultaneity that he wishes to establish Paradoxical y this makes of original sin the origin of modernity if we take modernity to involve a shift from nonlinear to linear time which is indeed necessary for the discourse of modernity as linked to a sense of progress is to hold In this scenario the task of the critic is all the more urgent since the impossibility of seizing the present reinforces the importance of the critical act which is typical y viewed as coming after the artistic creative act as a comment upon it If there is no possibility of immediacy the function of the critic becomes primary rather than secondary or rather it becomes simultaneous or even synonymous with the act of creation in ways that Agamben has suggested While there is no creation to save it is the critical act itself that allows us to step out of the model of linear time that we saw Baudelaire forced to fall into Criticism inasmuch as it is creative rather than descriptive is thus removed from sequential temporality an idea de Man underscores In describing literature from the standpoint of modernity as the steady fluctuation of an entity away from and toward its own mode of being we have constantly stressed that this movement does not take place as an actual sequence Saving Nothing  in time to represent it as such is merely a metaphor making a sequence out of what occurs in fact as a synchronic juxtaposition Even in the discursive texts we have used the three moments of flight return and the turning point at which flight changes into return or viceversa exist simultaneously on levels of meaning that are so intimately intertwined that they cannot be separated When Baudelaire for example speaks of representation du present of memoire du present his language names at the same time the flight the turning point and the return  De Man s formulation suggests that when seeking an alternative model to linear time in Baudelaire we may wish to abandon the concept of eternity in favor of the kind of simultaneity that I have been emphasizing from Agamben s analysis and that Francoise Meltzer identifies as a key aspect of Baudelairean temporality Time in Baudelaire is precisely not the collapse of everything into one eternity of space There are two times in Baudelaire the past which can serve as an antidote to the present and the future which poisons the present Thus the present is the place in which a double vision not only is made possible but is demanded   These considerations of temporality in Baudelaire may seem to have taken us far from the question of redemption a famous analyst of Baudelaire s work Walter Benjamin will help us establish the links among nonlinear temporality the critical act and redemption but not by way of his writings on Baudelaire Rather two key passages from Benjamin s Trauerspiel book will not only further illuminate the links among these categories but also themselves serve as an illustration of the non linearity of developments in literary criticism as we go back in time from de Man to Benjamin by approximately the same fortyyear period that separates de Man from Agamben In the EpistemoCritical Prologue to The Origin of German Tragic Drama Benjamin writes Method is a digression Tirelessly the process of thinking makes new beginnings returning in a roundabout way to its original object This continual pausing for breath is the mode most proper to the process of contemplation   Here Benjamin links the critical act with nonlinearity by identifying a return to the object of criticism which is not simply a temporal regression but rather a return with a renewed understanding a new way in which artistic creation and criticism are conjoined The stakes are much higher by the end of Benjamin s study however since the act of contemplation here restricted for the most part to the critical act is expanded and most significantly for our purposes infused with a theological impetus The Bible introduces evil in the concept of knowledge The serpent s promise to the first men was to make them knowing both good and evil But it is said of God after the creation And God saw everything that he had made and behold it was very good Knowledge of evil therefore has no object There is no evil in the world It arises in man himself with the desire for knowledge or rather for judgment Knowledge of good as knowledge is secondary It ensues from practice Knowledge of evil as knowledge this is primary It ensues from contemplation  The Fall Out of Redemption Knowledge of good and evil is then the opposite of all factual knowledge Related as it is to the depths of the subjective it is basical y only knowledge of evil In the very fall of man the unity of guilt and signifying emerges as an abstraction The allegorical has its existence in abstractions as an abstraction as a faculty of the spirit of language itself it is at home in the Fal    Here a new significance is assigned to contemplation the concept which links this passage to the earlier one It is now identified as the source of knowledge of evil which Baudelaire in L irremediable Beyond Redemption calls la conscience dans le Mal consciousness of doing Evil OC   Identifying the fall with knowledge rather than primarily with an act of disobedience will be an important theme running through Baudelaire and some of his interpreters who will play an important role in my analysis most notably Benjamin Fondane If the word contemplation signifies the same kind of activity in both passages that I have quoted from Walter Benjamin then the critical act is at the source of the knowledge of evil and the conscience of evil is linked to the nonlinear temporality that allows us to speak of literary creation and criticism as simultaneous rather than consecutive It is notable that there is no reference to redemption here in Benjamin Looking forward to Agamben we recall that there can be no redemption on his account because it would be a redemption without an object given that nothing not even the artwork can be eternally recuperated Benjamin prefigures these austere visions of falling without redemption and knowledge of good and evil reduced to knowledge of evil alone His theologically inflected reading of contemplation allows us to flesh out Agamben s analogy between literary creation criticism and theological creation redemption and to see that to set up a simple parallel between them is to miss a crucial point about the predominance of evil and some of the temporal consequences of this analogy We are now well positioned to see how evil the fal  nonlinear time creation and criticism come together in Baudelaire s poetry I would claim that we need to see the theological backdrop of Baudelaire s poetry not as a remnant of a poetic past which the more modern Baudelaire casts aside but rather as a crucial category for understanding Baudelaire s sense of modernity Creatively and critical y it is most fruitful to see the theological concerns posed by Les Fleurs du Mal as primary and to consider the shock of the modern as a result of the impossibility of thinking the modern in the sense of a new form of the present John Jackson has pointed to the links between time and the impossibility of redemption implied by Baudelaire s poetry Analyzing L horloge The Clock Jackson writes la conscience du temps qui passe dans le poeme ne s ouvre sur aucune possibilite de redemption Le souvienstoi ne decouvre pour finir qu un desespoir the consciousness of time that passes in the poem does not open onto any possibility of redemption The remember only uncovers final y a despair   Going even further Jackson acknowledges that the poem reveals a vision that supprime la vision d avenir pourtant essentielle cancels the ability to see the future which is nonetheless essential   Similarly Ian Alexander contends that in Baudelaire Saving Nothing  the future becomes merely the prospect of an endless recurrence of past sins The result is that the present isolated from past and future is experienced as a mere point in an infinite succession of monotonously recurring and discontinuous instants Time is not so much the passage as the substitution of identical and isolated moments precluding both continuity and progress behind a load of sin before an endless recurrence of sin and in the present vain gnawing remorse with at the end death as the final term  Whether the present in Baudelaire is nonexistent as de Man had claimed or a vantage point for double vision as Meltzer maintains or a moment isolated from past and future in order to become a torturous eternal return of monotony it is clear that temporality in Baudelaire is inextricably linked to a vision that cannot be reduced to a mere secularization of Christian concepts While Jackson does call Baudelaire s recuperation of death as the site of transcendence a secularization   he also offers the helpful concept of resonance of the theological in Baudelaire s metaphysical vision a ghostly presence both absent and immediately present this concept of the resonant presence of the past also underscores the alteration of temporality that allows us to think the modern as antimodern in Baudelaire and the act of criticism as an act of creation simultaneous with poetic creation A closer look at Baudelaire s poetry in conjunction with the early Benjamin will help us to articulate precisely why redemption is impossible in Baudelaire and what the consequences of this impossibility are The most relevant poems form a cluster at the conclusion of the Spleen et Ideal Spleen and Ideal section of Les Fleurs du Mal Of the seven final poems of that section four are new to the  edition These additions recontextualize the other three poems and allow us to read this final cluster together as representing a move toward a more thorough thinking through of the logic and consequences of the impossibility of redemption The poems together form an ending to Spleen et Ideal that closes in on itself and progresses toward its ending while at the same time introducing poems which by their nonlinear development and the complex subjectivity that they construct lead the reader into a vortex which cancels that forward momentum in ways that have theological as well as poetic implications Evidence of a fall into stagnation appears in L irremediable whose title unambiguously indicates the asoteriological logic that dominates the end of this section The images in the poem are curiously devoid of any presenttense verb and remain frozen in a series of gerunds un malheureux cherchant la lumiere An unfortunate looking for the light  Un damne descendant sans lampe A damned soul descending without light  Un navire pris dans le pole Cherchant par quel detroit fatal Il est tombe dans cette geole A ship caught in the polar sea Seeking the fatal strait through which It came into that prison are identified by the poet as Emblemes nets tableau parfait D une fortune irremediable Qui donne a penser que le Diable Fait toujours bien tout ce qu il fait I   The Fall Out of Redemption Patent symbols perfect picture Of an irremediable fate Which makes one think that the Devil Always does well whatever he does  All of these images frozen in time originate from a fal  as we see in the first stanza Une Idee une Forme un Etre Parti de l azur et tombe Dans un Styx bourbeux et plombe Ou nul oeil du Ciel ne penetre  An Idea a Form a Being Which left the azure sky and fel Into a leaden miry Styx That no eye in Heaven can pierce  Notably it is not Satan s domain of hell but rather the path to a more neutral pagan underworld that is the destination of the fallen idea here the kingdom not of revolt but of mere separation from the heavens of the kind that the Baudelaire of the first fall experiences as he is suspended in the contemplation of evil If the Devil always does well whatever he does here it is not the devil to which one can ally oneself by active revolt but one that paralyzes that revolt and who thus becomes an ally in the frozen contemplation with the promise neither of revolt nor redemption Contemplation figures in L irremediable not only through the evocation of thinking in the stanza just quoted but also through the teteatete sombre that the poet has with his own heart in the closing stanzas of the poem which leads him very much as Benjamin describes to the puits de verite that is consciousness of evil Teteatete sombre et limpide Qu un coeur devenu son miroir Puits de Verite clair et noir Ou tremble une etoile livide Un phare ironique infernal Flambeau des graces sataniques Soulagement et gloire uniques La conscience dans le Mal  Somber and limpid teteatete A heart become its own mirror Well of Truth clear and black Where a pale star flickers Saving Nothing  A hellish ironic beacon Torch of satanical blessings Sole glory and only solace The consciousness of doing evil  The beacon figured in this stanza is not ironic because it brings darkness rather than light as would be the case in a more typical satanic scenario wrought by the Prince of Darkness Rather the beacon does in fact il uminate the irony is to be found in the fact that the il uimination is not projected out onto external reality but inward in order to produce the consciousness of evil that is rendered by contemplation the autoreflexive mirror that once again Narcissuslike is reduced to actionless contemplation removed from temporality and thus from the possibility of action This Baudelaire is different from the one Benjamin characterized in his later work on Baudelaire and who reveals as Richard Wolin summarized the manner in which the alwaysthesame of prehistory manifests itself in the modern insofar as the modern manifests itself as the alwaysthesame of the endless stream of consumer goods or fashion   The Baudelaire of the poem we have been considering is not even able to attain this eternal return of the same of modernity because he is suspended in a contemplation that precludes any kind of movement in time and thus any kind of recurrence and that results in nothing beyond the knowledge of evil untranslatable into any sense of history or temporal progression or regression The notion of the unredeemable and its consequences for a suspension of linear temporality as they are explored in L irremediable sheds light retrospectively on a poem placed four spots back in the section and which also provides crucial insight into Baudelaire s asoteriological logic Le gout du neant The Desire for Annihilation The poem begins by tracing a temporal scheme rooted in the ne  plus the source of the spirit s current restlessness Morne esprit autrefois amoureux de la lutte L Espoir dont l eperon attisait ton ardeur Ne veut plus t enfourcher OC  Dejected soul once anxious for the strife Hope whose spur fanned your ardor into flame No longer wishes to mount you  The poet enjoins his heart to resign itself to this fate adding dors ton sommeil de brute sleep your brutish sleep OC   The poem has an unusual structure with quatrains in rime embrassee followed by a single line whose rhyme is the same as the one that links the first and last lines of the stanza that precedes it thus embodying in poetic form the resonance of the rhyme the kind of resonance of the theological that is an important part of Baudelaire s poetic universe These three single lines of poetry that follow their respective stanzas sketch the general movement of the poem Resignetoi mon coeur dors ton sommeil de brute Resign yourself my heart sleep  The Fall Out of Redemption your brutish sleep Le Printemps adorable a perdu son odeur Adorable spring has lost its fragrance Avalanche veuxtu m emporter dans ta chute Avalanche will you sweep me along in your fall  It is this final line that is of interest here the culmination of a poem whose last stanza speaks of time swallowing up the poet Et le Temps m engloutit minute par minute Comme la neige immense un corps pris de roideur Je contemple d en haut le globe en sa rondeur Et je n y cherche plus l abri d une cahute Avalanche veuxtu m emporter dans ta chute I  And Time engulfs me minute by minute As the immense snow a stiffening corpse I survey from above the roundness of the globe And I no longer seek there the shelter of a hut Avalanche will you sweep me along in your fall  The avalanche is given only in potential here the poet is not even able to actualize his own damnation clearly evoked by the chute but rather remains suspended in the impossibility of action at one of those moments in Baudelaire where the past is visible but the present is ineffective and the future uncertain  This final line sends the reader and the poet who is addressing himself back to the concluding line of the first stanza Resignetoi mon coeur Since action is suspended in presumed impossibility the only remaining option is resignation to inaction The accomplishment of both redemption and damnation is blocked at the end of the poem and a clue about the reason for this is available in the lines just quoted Je contemple d en haut le globe en sa rondeur While still existing presumably as a subject in the historical world the poet identifies himself as removed from that world engaged in contemplation We recall that for Benjamin this is the very act that awakens our knowledge not of good and evil but of evil alone Here we have the poet engaged in the double role of creator and critic if we extend the definition of the latter to include selfconscious reflection on the poem contained within the poem itself so that the poet becomes simultaneously a critic and the reader becomes witness not just to the result of the poet s contemplation but to that very contemplation itself The reluctance of the poet to follow his own advice to resign himself to the suspended action recal s a section of De profundis clamavi Out of the Depths Have I Cried from earlier in Spleen et Ideal Je jalouse le sort des plus vils animaux Qui peuvent se plonger dans un sommeil stupide Tant l echeveau du temps lentement se devide OC  Saving Nothing  I envy the lot of the lowest animals Who are able to sink into a stupid sleep So slowly does the skein of time unwind  What is desirable about the animal state is that not only are animals unconcerned about salvation and damnation because they cannot participate in it in the first place but also that they are not endowed with the contemplative faculty Here once again consciousness and the necessary faculty of contemplation that accompanies it is the main source of suffering and cannot be corrected The poet s appeal to the avalanche at the end of Le gout du neant is an appeal either to damnation or oblivion but both of these options have already in the progression of the seven final poems of Spleen et Ideal been identified as impossible The first of these final seven Obsession plays a crucial structural role in conditioning the way we read the poems that follow it Grands bois vous m effrayez comme des cathedrales Vous hurlez comme l orgue et dans nos coeurs maudits Chambres d eternel deuil ou vibrent de vieux rales Repondent les echos de vos De profundis Je te hais Ocean tes bonds et tes tumultes Mon esprit les retrouve en lui ce rire amer De l homme vaincu plein de sanglots et d insultes Je l entends dans le rire enorme de la mer Comme tu me plairais o nuit sans ces etoiles Dont la lumiere parle un langage connu Car je cherche le vide et le noir et le nu Mais les tenebres sont ellesmemes des toiles Ou vivent jaillissant de mon oeil par milliers Des etres disparus aux regards familiers OC   Great woods you frighten me like cathedrals You roar like the organ and in our cursed hearts Rooms of endless mourning where old deathrattles sound Respond the echoes of your De profundis I hate you Ocean your bounding and your tumult My mind finds them within itself that bitter laugh Of the vanquished man full of sobs and insults I hear it in the immense laughter of the sea  The Fall Out of Redemption How I would like you Night without those stars Whose light speaks a language I know For I seek emptiness darkness and nudity But the darkness is itself a canvas Upon which live springing from my eyes by thousands Beings with understanding looks who have vanished  Here we have the tormented consciousness that blurs the distinction between inside and outside so that the tumults of the Ocean recur within the mind of the subject thus eliminating the need for an external world because the torment to be found there is already within the consciousness The first tercet is a straightforward wish for the neant nothingness that the poet evokes one poem later in Le gout du neant but the conclusion of Obsession provides an important insight as to why the wishes of the poet in Le gout du neant must go unfulfilled This is because the desired neant is impossible as long as the subject exists he will continue to perceive sensations against the backdrop of the neant The poem stages the kinds of reflection on nothingness which also figure in philosophical accounts such as those of Martin Heidegger who in his  essay What is Metaphysics posed the question of how to think the nothing without transforming it into a something What is the nothing Every answer to this question is also impossible from the start For it necessarily assumes the form the nothing is this or that    Heidegger goes on to argue that anxiety reveals the nothing and as it does so robs us of speech   For him Being held out into the nothing on the ground of concealed anxiety is its surpassing of beings as a whole It is transcendence   Yet for Baudelaire what serves as an answer to Heidegger s question about the nature of metaphysics only reinforces the impossibility of canceling existence since what Baudelaire seeks is not a foundation for metaphysics but rather a way to move beyond it which Heidegger effectively shows is impossible For Baudelaire the only escape from such a predicament is death but an important consequence of the impossibility of redemption is that death would also mean the end of the subject altogether not the freedom of the subject from the terror of the tumults and other disturbing sensations that the poet describes If there is release from these sensations there would no longer be a subject there to perceive this release since the desired oblivion would abolish the subject as wel  What remains is thus the poetic subject turned in on himself and condemned to suffer not only the torments he evokes but also the knowledge that there is no possibility of being able to perceive the state of nothingness where the torments would cease Obsession provides the basic metaphysical framework for understanding the six poems that follow it at the conclusion of Spleen et Ideal It furnishes an endpoint because the position it exposes cannot be overcome by anything except a redemptive act precisely the act that is consistently refused by Baudelaire After Obsession then we can go no further we remain trapped in a cyclic subjectivity unable to transcend its situation or bring it to an end Saving Nothing  Georges Bataille s remarks on silence in Inner Experience resonate with Baudelaire s characterization of the necessarily frustrated desire to attain the nothing But the difficulty is that one manages neither easily nor completely to silence oneself that one must fight against onself with precisely a mother s patience we seek to grasp within us what subsists safe from verbal servilities and what we grasp is ourselves fighting the battle stringing sentences together perhaps about our effort then about its failure but sentences all the same powerless to grasp anything else  This inability to establish silence and condemnation to proliferate sentences endlessly echoes the image in Obsession of darkness being itself a canvas and Bataille s use of a specifical y linguistic conception of the impossibility of the nothing allows us to consider another of Baudelaire s poems Le soleil in a new light The battle that involves stringing sentences together suggests the famous image of the poet Je vais m exercer seul a ma fantasque escrime Flairant dans tous les coins les hasards de la rime Trebuchant sur les mots comme sur les paves Heurtant parfois des vers depuis longtemps reves OC  I go alone to try my fanciful fencing Scenting in every corner the chance of a rhyme Stumbling over words as over paving stones Colliding at times with lines dreamed of long ago  While this is in some sense an ennobling vision of the poet s task and indeed the poet compares himself to the sun and claims that the latter ennoblit le sort des choses les plus viles ennobles the fate of the lowliest things    we cannot help but see such ennobling as il usory as an attempt at a redemption of sordid urban reality that may or may not attain a level of transfigured beauty The fact that claims about the possibility of such transfiguration exist sidebyside with assertions of skepticism about that transformation must give us pause here and in light of Bataille s comments about language and silence we can see even the poet s creative attempts as he portrays them here as difficult attempts to cancel nothingness through the il usions of art which in this context would be yet another unsuccessful attempt at maintaining emptiness darkness and nudity Rather than becoming distinct from everyday experience artistic creation here joins with other aspects of life that interefere with rather than help bring about the desired nothingness The  edition s inclusion of Obsession significantly mitigates the strangeness of L heautontimoroumenos The Man Who Tortures Himself  which had been present in the  edition couched between Causerie Conversation and Franciscae meae laudes In Praise of My Frances  two poems that do not help to account for the selftorturing subjectivity of L Heautontimoroumenos By contrast  The Fall Out of Redemption in its place in the  edition as the fourth poem after Obsession the poem makes perfect metaphysical sense as a manifestation of the consciousness of the subject who in Obsession and Le gout du neant had yearned for the neant but also established the condition of its impossibility and the reasons why such a condition is unredeemable We are left then with the doubled subjectivity of a consciousness which is necessarily turned in upon itself by the act of contemplation to which we are condemned Thus prepared by the poems that precede it the speaking subject in L Heautontimoroumenos is not an exception but rather the rule in a humanity condemned to contemplation which produces the doubleness incarnated in irony Ne suisje pas un faux accord Dans la divine symphonie Grace a la vorace Ironie Qui me secoue et qui me mord Elle est dans ma voix la criarde C est tout mon sang ce poison noir Je suis le sinistre miroir Ou la megere se regarde Je suis la plaie et le couteau Je suis le soufflet et la joue Je suis les membres et la roue Et la victime et le bourreau Je suis de mon coeur le vampire Un de ces grands abandonnes Au rire eternel condamnes Et qui ne peuvent plus sourire OC   Am I not a discord In the heavenly symphony Thanks to voracious Irony Who shakes me and who bites me She s in my voice the termagant All my blood is her black poison I am the sinister mirror In which the vixen looks I am the wound and the dagger I am the blow and the cheek I am the members and the wheel Victim and executioner Saving Nothing  I m the vampire of my own heart One of those utter derelicts Condemned to eternal laughter But who can no longer smile   The opening at the conclusion of the poem after the dash puts an abrupt end to the series of opposites into which the speaking subject fal s and which could potential y continue on to infinity removes the subject from the singular I and situates him in a larger group ces grands abandonnes those utter derelicts  How are we to understand this group The description of it as au rire eternel condamnes suggests the condition of those subjected to the kind of unredeemed and unredeemable experience that the poet has traced in the other poems we have been examining The condemnation here is related to the impossibility of canceling experience through the neant instead of which we are left with an eternal recurrence of the same a stagnation that results in forever unrealized and unrealizable potential action This is for Baudelaire the condition not just of a select few but everyone  Belonging to the group of the grands abandonnes does not require anything more than the mere consciousness of what is always already the fact about human existence that is that we are condemned by knowledge to the kind of infernal and eternal repetition that the poem describes and which it would itself have enacted if not for the interruption of the series of opposites which brings the poem to its conclusion That abrupt ending is itself an act of revelation of the condition of possibility of the eternal and unredeemable series of opposites What this poem provides is then an il ustration of la conscience dans le Mal which as we have seen is not the lot of a damned few but rather the generalized condition of unredeemable humanity as that is revealed in the poem whose very title is L irremediable And indeed L irremediable follows L heautontimoroumenos in the  edition at a point in the text where the progression from Obsession to Le gout du neant and on through L heautontimoroumenos has made the conclusions of L irremediable not surprising but inevitable and logical in light of the way Baudelaire has been painting the logic of antiredemption through these final poems of Spleen et Ideal L irremediable thus has much more metaphysical force in the  edition as opposed to the  edition where it had been preceded not by L Heautontimoroumenos but by Brumes et pluies Mist and Rain  which also suggests the delights of the neant but mitigates them in a more typical y postromantic possibility of sleeping off the desire for oblivion on a bed with a lover Rien n est plus doux au coeur plein de choses funebres Et sur qui des longtemps descendent les frimas o blafardes saisons reines de nos climats Que l aspect permanent de vos pales tenebres Si ce n est par un soir sans lune deux a deux D endormir la douleur sur un lit hasardeux OC   The Fall Out of Redemption Nothing is sweeter to a gloomy heart On which the hoarfrost has long been falling Than the permanent aspect of your pale shadows O wan seasons queens of our clime Unless it be to deaden suffering side by side In a casual bed on a moonless night  In the  edition Brumes et pluies is situated far from L irremediable appearing incongruously perhaps among the Tableaux parisiens Baudelaire s desire to fall as it manifests itself in Le gout du neant Avalanche veuxtu m emporter dans ta chute seems at first to be a perverse one a desire for damnation that one might identify as a symptom of the poet s already being in the grip of the devil but as Slavoj zizek points out in his reading of Christianity perversion is built into the story of redemption from the start The hidden perverse core of Christianity if it is prohibited to eat from the Tree of Knowledge in Paradise why did God put it there in the first place Is it not that this was a part of His perverse strategy first to seduce Adam and Eve into the Fal  in order then to save them In all other religions God demands that His followers remain faithful to Him only Christ asked his followers to betray him in order to fulfill his mission Here I am tempted to claim that the entire fate of Christianity its innermost kernel hinges on the possibility of interpreting this act in a nonperverse way Puppet   This reading of Christianity takes its logic seriously but pushes the consequences of the original terms in which the fall and the subsequent salvific act are imagined to a point where the standard Christian reading of those events becomes untenable If there is as zizek s reading suggests a fundamental perversion embedded in the logic of Christian story itself then idiosyncratic appropriations of Christianity such as Baudelaire s become far more comprehensible Viewed in light of zizek s analysis Baudelaire s use of the Christian theological paradigm minus redemption is not a perverse misreading of Christianity but rather is consistent with a Christianity that requires the fall in order for God to fulfill a preordained plan of redemption The desire to fal  in Baudelaire can now be seen as the betrayal that Christ unique in this among the gods asks for in order to fulfill his mission On this reading Baudelaire s desire is not perverse but rather necessary since the desire for redemption is coextensive with the desire for condemnation which is its precondition or rather its simultaneous condition The problem with the Fall is thus not that it is in itself a Fall but precisely that in itself it is already a Salvation which we misrecognize as a Fal  Consequently Salvation consists not in our reversing the direction of the Fall but in recognizing Salvation in the Fall itself Puppet   And here we have the answer to the question of why salvation is impossible for Baudelaire contemplation as knowledge of evil blocks even our Saving Nothing  ability to fall which is the necessary condition of salvation and may even be on zizek s reading synonymous with it Here the idea of the Baudelairean double fall becomes clear the original fall by virtue of the fact that it brings contemplative awareness of evil as we saw through Benjamin s observation about the fall as knowledge of evil alone  reduces us to inaction a stasis that calls for another fall the fall into satanic revolt which would cancel the stasis and be the necessary prelude to redemption But as we shall soon see that second fall into revolt is impossible to accomplish precisely because of the stasis from which we cannot ultimately escape This is why the Satanism of the Revolte poems is ultimately ineffective what zizek calls the perverse core of Christianity cancels a simple God Satan divide as Baudelaire s poetry intuitively demonstrates by refusing to come to rest in the simple act of revolt which fails to save the poet any more than drunkenness had in the section of Les Fleurs du Mal devoted to Le vin In this light I would like to offer a reading of the first of the Revolte poems Le reniement de Saint Pierre The Denial of Saint Peter with reference not only to zizek s reflections but also Agamben s analysis of glory and what he calls inoperativity to which I turn below Baudelaire s poem resists any simple interpretation On the surface the affirmation which comes at the very end of the poem s thirtytwo lines that Saint Peter was right to deny Jesus can easily be labeled blasphemy and indeed when the poem was published for the second time it was accompanied by a note explicitly reaffirming Jesus as Savior  But such simplicity disappears with any attempt to read that affirmation in the light of the poem as a whole The devil for instance is never mentioned in the poem which makes what transpires an affair between God and humanity In the first two stanzas God is portrayed as a despot compared to un tyran gorge de viande et de vins a tyrant gorged with food and wine falling asleep to the doux bruit de nos affreux blasphemes sweet sound of our horrible blasphemies  OC   Then Jesus is directly addressed in five stanzas where he is asked to remember the anguish of the Mount of Olives This is a very human Jesus trapped as is all of humanity according to the poem by the sadistic whims of the God evoked in the first two stanzas While some have called attention to similar nineteenthcentury poems set on the Mount of Olives such as Alfred de Vigny s Le Mont des Oliviers The Mount of Olives and Gerard de Nerval s Le Christ aux Oliviers Christ at the Mount of Olives  an important difference here is that while the heavens silence in those two poems is indicative of God s potential nonexistence in Baudelaire by contrast God is very much present in order the better to punish Jesus and all of humanity they are joined by the poet s evocation of Jesus crane ou vivait l immense Humanite skull where lived immense Humanity  OC   After evoking the physical sufferings of the passion Baudelaire asks the human Jesus Revaistu de ces jours si bril ants et si beaux Ou tu vins pour remplir l eternelle promesse Ou tu foulais monte sur une douce anesse Des chemins tout jonches de fleurs et de rameaux  The Fall Out of Redemption Ou le coeur tout gonfle d espoir et de vail ance Tu fouettais tous ces vils marchands a tour de bras Ou tu fus maitre enfin Le remords n atil pas Penetre dans ton flanc plus avant que la lance OC   Did you dream of those days so brilliant and so fair When you came to fulfill the eternal promise When the gentle donkey you were riding trampled The branches and flowers strewn in your path When your heart swollen with courage and hope You lashed those vile moneychangers with all your might In a word when you were master Did not remorse Penetrate your side deeper than the spear  The incarnation here was a moment of hope for Jesus himself and his greatest moment of glory is said to reside in the cleansing of the temple the moment of Jesus most forceful action All the rest of the story it turns out involved suffering and torture a crumbling of whatever hope had at first been present In this Jesus is very much human condemned to live out the impossibility of the ideal which had filled him with a false and impossible hope This poem paints a cruel God quite separate from the humanized Jesus who orchestrates the suffering that Jesus undergoes once his hope is vanquished If we return to zizek s reading of the perverse core of Christianity the poem is not at all blasphemous but rather a faithful representation of the Christian notion of the felix culpa the necessity of the fal  and thus of betrayal in order to enact redemption The fact that Baudelaire denies the possibility of redemption not so much in this particular poem as in his works taken collectively does not alter the fact that God s allowing the cruel suffering of his beloved son is perfectly in keeping with standard Christian theology If there is blasphemy in the poem it must lie in the conclusion Saint Pierre a renie Jesus il a bien fait Saint Peter denied Jesus he did well  OC   But given the thoroughly humanized Jesus that the poet presents in the poem what does it mean to deny Jesus here The fall into time was for this Jesus a fall from contemplation into action and thus into suffering which is the necessary companion of action as it is presented here In the last stanza separated by a dash from the section evoking Jesus suffering and remorse the poet explicitly addresses the question of action Certes je sortirai quant a moi satisfait D un monde ou l action n est pas la soeur du reve Puisseje user du glaive et perir par le glaive Saint Pierre a renie Jesus il a bien fait OC  Saving Nothing  For my part I shall indeed be content to leave A world where action is not the sister of dreams Would that I could take up the sword and perish by the sword Saint Peter denied Jesus he did well  The poet reveals here that he is in the same state of potential but suspended action with which Le gout du neant closes Avalanche veuxtu m emporter dans ta chute  This is the poet who has made the first fall into contemplation and thus knowledge of evil without the ability to make the second fall into action even satanic action that would save him from the inoperativity of stasis The remorse about which the poet speculates in Jesus case is the same one that confronts the reader in the third line of the liminal poem of the collection Au lecteur where the poet claims that nous alimentons nos aimables remords Comme les mendiants nourissent leur vermine we feed our pleasant remorse As beggars nourish their vermin  OC   In that poem it is not God but rather l Ennui who is characterized as a tyrannical despot dreaming of scaffolds en fumant son houka as he smokes his hookah pipe    Remorse is represented more than once as impossible to transcend in Les Fleurs du Mal in L irreparable The Irreparable  the poet asks rhetorically at the outset Pouvonsnous etouffer le vieux le long Remords Qui vit s agite et se tortille Can we stifle the old the lingering Remorse That lives quivers and writhes     This inability to triumph over remorse presented in the section Spleen et Ideal returns near the very end of the collection in the penultimate poem Le reve d un curieux Dream of a Curious Man  where the poet represents himself in a similar theatrical context waiting for an action that never comes Where then does that leave us in Le reniement de Saint Pierre The answer is linked to Baudelaire s implied reading of the incarnation Let us return to the passage I have cited from Mon Coeur mis a nu where Baudelaire takes up the question of the fall La Theologie Qu estce que la chute Si c est l unite devenue dualite c est Dieu qui a chute En d autres termes la creation ne seraitelle pas la chute de Dieu    Theology What is the fall If it is unity become duality it is God who has fallen If Baudelaire highlights Jesus fully human nature in Le reniement de Saint Pierre this implies that Jesus participates in creation and his own launching into historical time despite the Christian notion of Jesus being begotten not made genitum non factum  makes him share the fate of creation Here once  The Fall Out of Redemption again it is helpful to read Baudelaire together with zizek who presents an initially counterintuitive reading of the incarnation what does the becomingman of God in the figure of Christ His descent from eternity to the temporal realm of our reality mean for God Himself What if that which appears to us finite mortals as God s descent toward us is from the standpoint of God Himself an ascent What if eternity is less than temporality What if eternity is a stertile impotent lifeless domain of pure potentialities which in order ful y to actualize itself has to pass through temporal existence What if God s descent to man far from being an act of grace toward humanity is the only way for God to gain full actuality and to liberate Himself from the suffocating constraints of Eternity What if God actualizes Himself only through human recognition What however if eternity is the ultimate prison a suffocating closure and it is only the fall into time that introduces Opening into human experience Is Time not the name for the ontological opening The Event of incarnation is thus not so much the time when ordinary temporal reality touches Eternity but rather the time when Eternity reaches into time Puppet   This characterization corresponds at many points to the implied theology of Baudelaire s poem It is easy to see the God that the poet presents at the beginning of the poem as suffering from the suffocating constraints of Eternity this would be a God in the thral s of the same ennui that traps the poet in Au lecteur suggesting that in heaven as on earth the stasis of contemplation is unbearable The comparison of God to a tyrant is followed by an indication that he fal s asleep to the sound of human blasphemy God is compared to a tyrant not on account of what he does but of what he cannot do asleep he is unable or unmotivated to react to suffering On this reading the vigorously active Jesus whipping the temple merchants is the effective antidote to the eternal y inactive God la chute de Dieu the attempt to gain full actuality described here by zizek All the more disappointing then that even as a ful y incarnate human being Jesus is unable ful y to realize himself in action He follows the same trajectory as any human being trapped in what I have been calling the first fal  the fall into contemplation of evil that precludes action The poet unites himself to Jesus in the last stanza by rejecting a world where l action n est pas la soeur du reve if it is the suffering inoperative inactive Jesus of this poem that Saint Peter denies here then the denial is at most ambiguous rather than ful y blasphemous For this Peter denies the ful y human Jesus the one reduced like God himself to inaction the one who like the poet of Le gout du neant is trapped in sterile contemplation or in the case of Jesus here suffering  If the fall means abandoning eternity for the historical temporality of action then the incarnation as the chute de Dieu has not been ful y actualized in the life of Jesus Or perhaps it has inasmuch as this Jesus finds himself unable to complete the second fal  the fall into action that would cancel inoperativity God and man on this reading both seek an Opening away from stasis and both find it impossible If this impotent Saving Nothing  Jesus is the one Peter is said to deny here it is difficult to see how this could not be a well chosen denial since the Jesus that Peter denies before Jesus death of course is ful y alive and yet ful y inoperative This is precisely the human condition that awaits the second fal  into active rebellion through which one would have to pass on the logic that Baudelaire implies throughout these poems in order final y to arrive at redemption That next fal  however is not ful y realizable and thus redemption is blocked In that sense Jesus death redeems nothing and the poem may well be considered blasphemous taken however only at the level of Peter s denial as it is expressed at the moment when Jesus is alive but inactive the denial can only be seen as a necessary refusal of Jesus very human powerlessness his impotence like the poet s own to get beyond la conscience dans le Mal  This cosmological view does not simply deny the divinity of Jesus Baudelaire offers instead a much more complicated scenario As we have seen through reading Baudelaire and zizek together the distinction between God and man becomes blurred once we see stasis or inoperativity as a risk both in heaven and on earth for both God and humanity If creation is God s fal  a felix culpa happy fault in his case as for humanity s Jesus own status as both God and man is less crucial since on this view God himself is capable of a fal  Confirmation of the blurred distinction comes at the end of the second of the three poems that comprise the Revolte section of Les Fleurs du Mal Abel et Cain Abel and Cain  In what appears to be a straightforward final couplet Baudelaire seems to accomplish a simple reversal Race de Cain au ciel monte Et sur la terre jette Dieu Race of Cain ascend to heaven And cast God down upon the earth  OC   If we redefine notions of fall and ascent however in a way that allows for the chute de Dieu as an actualization of God this poem ends not with a call for God s dethronement but rather God s ennoblement through his sharing of temporal y situated action and Cain s subsequent damnation through ascent rather than descent a condemnation to the stagnation of the heavens that can only create a tyrant insensitive to suffering unable like the poet even to fal  Indeed the spatial reference of the poem suggests the very opposite of that potential y salvific fall by its call for Cain to rise The last of the Revolte poems Les litanies de Satan The Litanies of Satan is the only one specifical y to mention the devil and the one that seems to be a straightforward and childish attempt at blasphemy a simple reversal of God and Satan a genuine act of revolt But such a movement is ultimately a false path out of Ennui an unsuccessful attempt to fal  This is made clear in the quasinarrative structure of Les Fleurs du Mal itself where Revolte gives way to La Mort Death  Given the fact that Baudelaire does not operate within the traditional Christian framework of redemption however it would be hasty and even inaccurate to assume that the blasphemy of Revolte leads to the damnation of the speaking subject First there is no indication of such damnation happy or otherwise in the poems that comprise La Mort Rather we are left with the poet suspended in eager but futile anticipation in the penultimate poem Le reve d un curieux followed by Le voyage which appeals to a personified Death for help in being able to Plonger au fond du gouffre Enfer ou Ciel qu importe Au fond de l Inconnu pour trouver  The Fall Out of Redemption du nouveau to plunge To the abyss depths Heaven or Hel  does it matter To the depths of the Unknown to find something new  OC   Why would heaven or hell be equivalent possibilities here The answer lies in what we have already seen about the equivalence established between them and for that matter between both of them and the earthly state as wel  If God in the eternal stasis of heaven is bound by the same sort of crippling Ennui that characterizes the poet s fallen state then there is no reason to prefer heaven This stasis as we have seen is already presented as a hellish state from which active revolt would be a release But Baudelaire s hell as it is represented in the Priere that closes Les Litanies de Satan is a contemplative place rather than a site of rebellion Gloire et louange a toi Satan dans les hauteurs Du Ciel ou tu regnas et dans les profondeurs De l Enfer ou vaincu tu reves en silence Fais que mon ame un jour sous l Arbre de Science Pres de toi se repose a l heure ou sur ton front Comme un Temple nouveau ses rameaux s epandront   Glory and praise to you O Satan in the heights Of Heaven where you reigned and in the depths Of Hell where vanquished you dream in silence Grant that my soul may someday repose near to you Under the Tree of Knowledge when over your brow Its branches will spread like a new Temple  Continuity between heaven and hell is established in the figure of Satan himself who has inhabited both spaces in a similar way If heaven is the site of the eternal changelessness of glory rather than the seat of action then Satan s silent dreaming in hell is an apt equivalent The poet s final wish for repose implies a different kind of rest than the contemplation we have seen operating in other poems since rest is here figured as desirable rather than unbearable and irrevocable like the stasis of Ennui The Temple nouveau suggests the kind of opening onto a transformation of experience that we see at the end of Le voyage and its nouveau that would be indifferent to heaven or hell But the closing verses of the Litanies are situated solidly in a Satanism that would prohibit the poet from exclaiming Enfer ou Ciel qu importe this prayer is ineffective because the very status of the transfigured nouveau is called into question in both the Litanies and Le voyage Expressed as a wish or a prayer there is no confirmation that such repose is possible and again even if it were that it would be desirable As we have seen if the knowledge available to the descendents of Adam and Eve is knowledge of evil alone it can only end in la conscience dans le Mal rather than repose Satanism thus remains here at the end of the Revolte section a false escape The poet remains trapped in the first fall the one into stasis and contemplation but without rest The same antiredemptive logic that prevents death from being transformed into new life and sin from being Saving Nothing  canceled by forgiveness blocks the establishment of peace either in heaven or hell precisely because the new is shown to be impossible Baudelaire s notion of inoperativity is in some ways at odds with the way that concept is described by Giorgio Agamben who links the function of contemplative life and inoperativity with a corresponding entry into praxis by way of the opening of possibility properly human praxis is sabbatism that by rendering the specific functions of the living inoperative opens them to possibility Contemplation and inoperativity are in this sense the metaphysical operators of anthropogenesis which by liberating the living man from his biological or social destiny assign him to that indefinable dimension that we are accustomed to call politics Zoe ainonios eternal life is the name of this inoperative center of the human of this political substance of the Occident that the machine of the economy and of glory ceaselessly attempts to capture within itself Kingdom  Baudelaire refuses both the philosophical and Christian tradition evoked here by Agamben by the inability to pass from contemplation to action that marks his poetry While Baudelairean contemplation brings lucidity about evil it forecloses the chance of transcending that evil by its refusal of the possibility of redemption Given that Baudelaire works through these ideas in his poetry the relationship of literature to inoperativity becomes central indeed Agamben s own reflections about the potential action derived from inoperativity open onto questions of poetry in particular A model of this operation that consists in making all human and divine works inoperative is the poem Because poetry is precisely that linguistic operation that renders language inoperative or in Spinoza s terms the point at which language which has deactivated its communicative and informative functions rests within itself contemplates its power of saying potenza di dire and in this way opens itself to a new possible use And the poetic subject is not the individual who wrote these poems but the subject that is produced at the point at which language has been rendered inoperative and therefore has becomes in him and for him purely sayable What the poem accomplishes for the power of saying politics and philosophy must accomplish for the power of acting By rendering economic and biological operations inoperative they demonstrate what the human body can do they open it to a new possible use   At stake here is poetry s potential for conversion into action While Agamben at first seems to offer poetry as the model of the kind of potentialfilled inoperativity that he claims can be transformed into political praxis there is a curious divide between poetry and praxis by the end of this passage At first Agamben proposes the paradoxical situation of the act of literary creation as that which forecloses  The Fall Out of Redemption action by rendering language inoperative One would therefore expect that from this inoperativity would spring based on Agamben s earlier remarks a new and active potential or possibility But the rest of Agamben s analysis forfends the possibility of passing from saying to doing since while poetry opens language to a new possible use that act of opening results here in nothing more than language becoming the purely sayable a curious and nearly autoreferential turn While Agamben establishes a parallel between what poetry does for language and what politics does for acting there is no interpenetration of the two worlds here so that poetry can be said to contemplate itself or in other words to give voice to the conscience dans le Mal that it itself creates via the poem here seen as a contemplative act involving a creative but not an active word In Baudelaire s world then art therefore carries no redemptive value If for Benjamin the task of the critic is as Richard Wolin summarizes it that of rescuing the few unique visions of transcendence that grace the continuum of history the nowtimes Jetztzeiten  from the fate of oblivion which incessantly threatens to consume them   we have seen that the very act of contemplation by which the poet becomes a critic renders that rescue impossible since the poet is able to enter neither history nor a world of potential but rather remains engulfed in the unfulfilled desire to fal  the negative potentiality of the poet of Le gout du neant calling for the avalanche to sweep him downward Redemption is always either impossible unwanted or both And this is where Baudelaire joins Agamben in an implicit commentary on Benjamin We recall that for Agamben redemption is nothing other than a potentiality to create that remains pending that turns on itself and saves itself Nudities   Agamben s desire to create joins Baudelaire s desire to fall in the realm of unfulfil able potential a potential without potential Herein lies the problem that comes with being both poet and critic as Baudelaire would put it Agamben writes That which the angel forms produces and caresses the prophet brings back to an unformed state and contemplates His eyes observe that which is saved but only inasmuch as it will be lost on the last day   The unsavable remains which Agamben defines as that work in which creation and salvation action and contemplation persist in every moment and in the same being   The work of poetry for Baudelaire results paradoxical y in his painting of the lyric subject suspended in contemplation unable to fall the poem is thus an active creation that is nonetheless unable to redeem the unproductive inoperativity it paints the purely sayable remaining suspended in the space between contemplation and action The simultaneity of creation and salvation that Agamben describes in the passage just quoted cal s into question our ability to preserve the distinction between the pairs of opposites he mentions and at the same time challenges us to perform the kind of reading that I have attempted here an interhistorical one that seeks to establish critical simultaneity among thinkers from several periods Agamben s writing without footnotes helps to create the space for such dialogue across the history of criticism and even allows us to continue the critical conversation in a way that challenges Agamben s final assertion about salvation that no longer has an objective   a fact he considers belated knowledge and about which he affirms Saving Nothing  that we are ultimately left in sharp contrast to the purely sayable that he evokes in The Kingdom and the Glory with an awareness of what he cal s in Creation and Salvation our subsequent lack of anything else to say   Both saying and salvation ultimately become divorced from their objects so that what we are left with is a transformed saying a pure iteration that was further explored in the pure poetics of Mal arme and Valery and in the case of Baudelaire a meaningless concept of salvation which cannot have value apart from its ability to take an object but as Agamben demonstrates which persists nonetheless While we might not be able to get by without the category of salvation the dialogue his essay can inspire when read in conjunction with Baudelaire s poetics of the unredeemable suggests that it is from this belated knowledge that a new kind of alinear critical dialogue at the interstices of creation and salvation can spring  A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane The Baudelaire of Walter Benjamin has become iconic His multifaceted portrait of the poet undergoing the traumatic shock of urban experience in the capital of the nineteenth century is intimately familiar and even hauntingly so to students and critics of Baudelaire in the age of cultural studies Yet focusing on the Benjaminian Baudelaire exclusively as he emerges in essays such as On Some Motifs in Baudelaire and The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire risks casting aside some of the most fundamental questions that ground the theologicoesthetic worldview that Baudelaire shapes in both Les Fleurs du Mal and Le Spleen de Paris while at the same time giving short shrift to crucial theological elements of Benjamin s earlier thought which largely predates but arguably informs his later writings and their more explicit focus on Baudelaire Common to Benjamin and Baudelaire is an idiosyncratic approach to the notion of redemption and despite Benjamin s engagement with the messianic in his earlier thought it will be my contention in this chapter that he ultimately gives insufficient attention to the removal of salvation from Baudelaire s cosmological worldview My analysis in this chapter will continue the attempt in Chapter  to begin to draw all of the consequences from Baudelaire s asoteriological theology for his worldview and esthetics Once again the journey will take us back to Benjamin s earlier writings and in fact will involve an attempt to enrich a Benjaminian reading of Baudelaire with its complement a Baudelairean reading of Benjamin which cal s into question the space Benjamin makes as small and fragile as that space may be for the messianic I will then turn by contrast to another figure the poet and critic Benjamin Fondane who engages with Baudelaire s asoteriological world in ways that I will suggest are more fruitful than Benjamin s when it comes to accounting for and drawing the consequences of Baudelaire s thinking outside and beyond redemption Nearly exact contemporaries the German critic who died fleeing the Nazis and the RomanianFrench poet and essayist who perished at AuschwitzBirkenau provide two different ways of coming to terms with Baudelaire s astoreiological vision at a particularly charged moment both for European history and for the reception and interpretation of Baudelaire s poetry and thought Given the tentative interrogatory nature of some of Benjamin s fragmentary writings it is worth remembering that his plan for the Baudelaire study was quite different from what has come down to us today partly unfinished partly never written The plan of the book indicates a study where the experience of urban shock as it is portrayed primarily in the Tableaux parisiens was much less a central concern than  The Fall Out of Redemption it is in the writings that have come down to us in finished form and which have played such a defining role in the analysis of Baudelaire in the mode of cultural studies Benjamin s book was to be in three parts the first of which would analyze the decisive significance of allegory for Baudelaire s Fleurs du Mal and reconstruct the foundations of Baudelaire s allegorical inclinations  As Richard Wolin details in the period when Benjamin was transitioning from his more theological y inflected work to the historical materialist writings that have held such strong sway in contemporary engagement with both Benjamin and Baudelaire it was Theodor Adorno who strove desperately to bring Benjamin back to the conception of history of the Trauerspiel book ie the idea of history as a continuum of disaster  Yet at this point in his intellectual development Benjamin felt that the retention of the equal y undialectical pessimistic philosophy of history of his theological phase would be incompatible with a genuinely materialistic perspective which emphasized the progressive emancipation of mankind through the mechanism of class struggle Wolin  This is not of course to say that the later Benjamin simply accomplishes a clean break with his older modes of thought as Benjamin himself acknowledges in a letter of March  I have never been able to think and research otherwise than if I may say so in a theological sense qtd in Wolin   Such remarks along with a careful reading of Benjamin s critical texts themselves easily confirm Uwe Steiner s contention that the division that some scholars of Benjamin would like to make between an early period of metaphysicaltheological interests and a later period with a Marxist orientation is justified while at the same time unjustified Steiner   Leo Bersani goes a step further claiming that the profound religious orientation of Benjamin s thought in all periods is of such importance that his thought makes no sense without it and that it would be an error to bracket his religious yearning as we admire and profit from his observations on Proust Kafka Baudelaire and Goethe because all of these insights stem from a consistent set of assumptions of lost wholeness of fallen being informing Benjamin s writings in all periods Bersani   What is true of Benjamin in this case is also true of Baudelaire as I hope my argument thus far has begun to suggest Baudelaire s work like Benjamin s can most profitably be understood only in the context of the idiosyncratic theology that informs Baudelaire s work throughout his career and indeed if anything more rather than less so in his final period when he authored the prose poems many of which present along with the Tableaux parisiens inserted in the  edition of Les Fleurs du Mal his most incisive portrayal and analysis of life in the modern city that supposedly increasingly secular space This precedence and persistence of a theological vision is an often underacknowledged source of intellectual affinity between the late Baudelaire and the late Benjamin As should be clear by now in neither case do we have a simple or transparent transposition of an established or conventional theological view Benjamin s transposition of messianism is in some ways as idiosyncratic to the Jewish A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  tradition as Baudelaire s reinvention of a Christianity without redemption and both of them consequently provide an intriguingly complex portrait of a secular world shot through with a theological impetus that cal s traditional religious frameworks into question while at the same time questioning a thoroughly secularized worldview But I will contend in this chapter that the fact that Benjamin retains some sort of focus on the messianic in however an unconventional form that focus might take compromises any similarity of vision we might establish between the theological orientations of Benjamin and Baudelaire given that the latter s work unrelentingly seeks to think through the consequences of the elimination of redemption from his theological perspective In other words nowhere is Benjamin simultaneously closer to and further from Baudelaire than in the former s earlier work informed more closely and more directly by metaphysical and theological conceptions but retaining nonetheless an emphasis on redemption that Baudelaire would reject If both the critic and the poet lean heavily on the primacy of the degraded condition of humanity as a consequence of the fal  Benjamin s retention of some kind of hope for redemption places him in a theological sphere markedly different from Baudelaire s right from the start As Richard Wolin emphasizes in a reading of the prologue to Benjamin s Trauerspiel book The concept of experience Benjamin strives to present seeks to approximate the fullness of theological experience and thus the suspicion of dogmatism can never be entirely scotched However it is never a positive image of redemption that one finds reproduced in his writings rather by viewing the world from the standpoint of a hypothetical intelligible realm it is his intention to set its degraded condition in relief all the more vividly Wolin  I shall have more to say below about the notion of messianic time in Benjamin but for now it is important to remember that his focus on redemption is not restricted to his earlier writings As late as the Central Park fragments of   just after the assertion that the concept of progress must be grounded in the idea of catastrophe we find this observation Redemption depends on the tiny fissure in the continuous catastrophe Writer   To hold out hope of redemption even in hypothetical or even negative forms of expression is to sustain a soteriological vision that Baudelaire s criticism and poetry show to be untenable To be sure there are moments of erotic and especial y esthetic release from degradation and damnation in Baudelaire but in the larger frame of his thought and in the conceptual and narrative shapes of Les Fleurs du Mal these moments are not capable of being sustained and must ultimately be dismissed as il usory not unlike the artificial highs of drugs that mask truth rather than revealing it In that sense Baudelaire s vision is unrelenting and uncompromising unwilling to grant any real status to the il usory forms of what might look like redemption or release In that he stands as a challenger both to Nietzsche s estheticism as I shall explore in Chapter  and even to the theorist of weak Messianic power Illuminations  who as late as the Theses on the Philosophy of History transforms but does not completely reject a  The Fall Out of Redemption theology of redemption Such holding on to the potential for salvation in the midst of an iniquitous historical era that could only seem emphatical y removed from al hope of salvation Wolin  is one of the main points of continuity of the early and late Benjamin who shows himself as consistent in this paradoxical retention of the category of redemption as Baudelaire is over the course of his own career in its rejection and indeed ultimate elimination from his poetry and criticism Commentators on Benjamin s conception of redemption emphasize its relation to the idea of a return to origins or more explicitly the Kabbalistic notion of redemption as the return to the condition of universal harmony represented by the Tree of Life usual y envisioned in terms of a return to paradise or a restoration of the Davidic Kingdom Wolin   Reading Benjamin s essay on Proust along with On Some Motifs in Baudelaire Tomoko Masuzawa argues that Benjamin s notion of redemption takes the form of memory and mimesis A past is to be recognized and recovered redemption refers to this recovery or rather discovery for the first time of the sentence of distance and depth of time Masuzawa   Redemption would signal not a mere recovery of origins but a transformation of historical experience in light of those origins Benjamin s very first critical engagements with Baudelaire take up the question of origins but already in the context of knowledge and guilt to which as we saw in Chapter  he pays critical attention in the Trauerspiel book His first fragments on Baudelaire which date from  to  and which thus predate the Trauerspiel study on which Benjamin began working in  the year in which he published his translations of Baudelaire s Tableaux parisiens  take up the question of guilt remorse and redemption explicitly Underlying Baudelaire s writings is the old idea that knowledge is guilt His soul is that of Adam to whom Eve the world once upon a time offered the apple from which he ate Thereupon the spirit expelled him from the garden Knowledge of the world had not been enough for him he wanted to know its good and evil sides as wel  And the possibility of this question which he was never able to answer is something he bought at the price of eternal remorse Remord  His soul has this mythical prehistory of which he knows and thanks to which he knows more than others about redemption He teaches us above all to understand the literal meaning of the word knowledge in the story of Eden Writer   There is no doubt that this mythical prehistory informs all of Baudelaire what gives rise to question in this passage is the claim that Baudelaire knows more than others about redemption Without further elaboration it is hard to know precisely what Benjamin means by this but in light of Baudelaire s exclusion of redemption and refusal of the possibility of grace we are compelled to read Benjamin s contention despite Benjamin s own lingering engagement with redemption as meaning that Baudelaire knows enough about redemption to reject it and to attempt to think beyond it In the Trauerspiel book Benjamin would go on we recal  to argue that knowledge of evil has no object because everything God made was good and that knowledge of evil is primary and ensues from contemplation as the opposite of A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  all factual knowledge Origin    To dwell in knowledge and contemplation is to dwell in evil without the tiny fissure that would make room for the redemptive even as a hypothetical possibility Commentators have highlighted the place he holds out for redemption Beyond Richard Wolin s booklength study of the subject Carol Jacobs reminds us of the mortification of the textual object involved in the act of criticism according to Benjamin The ruin and decay assigned to naturehistory when staged by tragic drama reappears as critical writing Transforming historical content into truth content criticism saves the work of art only at the price of its mortification It is as though criticism were already in the work of art as its potential Jacobs    It is not hard to see traces and more than traces of a Christian redemptive logic of transformation by death after a suffering that brings to actuality a potential for an afterlife that was present but not yet actualized by the work  Sometimes among critics writing in English this redemptive move is the result of a translation of Benjamin s notion of Rettung as redemption an interpretation that adds a theological resonance to a German concept general y bereft of religious overtones and that might be better rendered as rescue Such is the case of Michael Jennings reading of the dialectical image in The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire the key to which is according to Jennings Benjamin s muchdiscussed notion of the redemption Rettung of certain moments of the past Jennings   We need not however lean heavily on the notion of Rettung with its tenuous connections to religious salvation in order to see a logic of redemption in Benjamin Benjamin s redemption could occur only as an extrahistorical event Jennings   thus bringing it more in line with a Jewish concept of messianism rather than the Christian salvific intervention in history the death and resurrection of Christ in addition to the moment beyond history Nevertheless whether under the sign of the hypothetical or the actual the immanent or extrahistorical the politohistorical or the criticoliterary redemption continues to govern Benjamin s thought in ways that make it incompatible with Baudelaire s Even if Benjamin s antirevolutionary conception of history judges with a profound pessimism the chances that the punctual breakthroughs that undermine the alwaysthesame will combine into a tradition and not be forgotten as Jurgen Habermas wrote it is nonetheless true that that conception of history is not rendered utterly blind toward steps forward in the emancipation of the human race Habermas   Given Benjamin s early reflection on Baudelaire and the related ideas developed without reference to the poet in the Trauerspiel book it is surprising to consider the quite different turn that Benjamin s writings on Baudelaire were to take later these represent almost an abnegation of his earlier thoughts even as the theological impetus that informs them persists in Benjamin s latest writings By the time of The Paris of the Second Empire in Baudelaire   a ful y materialist reading of Baudelaire comes to the fore in this comment on the poem Abel et Cain Cain the ancestor of the disinherited appears as the founder of a race and this race can be none other than the proletariat Writer   This remark stands in stark contrast to a note in the Arcades project where Benjamin resists Ernest Seilliere s reading of  The Fall Out of Redemption Le reniement de Saint Pierre a poem from the same section of Les Fleurs du Mal as Abel et Cain which sees Christ s remorse as stemming from having let pass so fine an opportunity for proclaiming the dictatorship of the proletariat a reading Benjamin dismisses as inane Arcades   Similarly in the Paris of the Second Empire essay Benjamin asserts that Baudelaire s Satanism must not be taken too seriously If it has some significance it is as the only attitude in which Baudelaire was able to sustain a nonconformist position for any length of time Writer   Here Benjamin prefigures Fredric Jameson s dismissal of the Baudelaire of diabolism and of cheap frisson Jameson   but to dismiss Satanism as an uninteresting or irrelevant aspect of Baudelaire s work is to misunderstand its role for it is not simply an adolescent reversal of conventional virtue or a simple desire to generate scandal that motivates the Revolte poems Rather Satanism is a powerful but ultimately futile attempt to resolve the implications of Baudelaire s asoteriological theology depending as it does on the logic of redemption it remains thoroughly tied to traditional Christian theology and thus must be rejected under Baudelaire s radical revision of it To say that we should take Baudelaire s Satanism seriously is not to claim that we should consider him an active Satanist in that respect Benjamin s assertion is correct But it would be wrong to conclude that we should dismiss the poems of Revolte in favor of other supposedly more pertinent modern poems located in other sections of Les Fleurs du Mal since that would deny the primacy of the theological in Baudelaire as Benjamin seems to do at this point in his own engagement with the poet when he goes on to comment that it is merely a different view of the problem if one asks what impelled Baudelaire to give a radical theological form to his radical rejection of those in power   This period in Benjamin s work sees a tension then between a chiefly political y inflected reading of Baudelaire and a more nuanced interpretation that would emphasize some continuity with his earlier and more explicitly metaphysical or theological work Benjamin wrote the Paris of the Second Empire essay in the summer and fall of  a period which overlaps with the time of composition of the Central Park fragments on which Benjamin was at work from April  to February  In the latter Benjamin takes up theological considerations more explicitly and more seriously and with a vocabulary that also echoes his earlier work on Trauerspiel Benjamin traces the transformation of the Catholic notion of taedium vitae into spleen and notes that in Baudelaire s melancholy Trauer  all that is left of the infinite regress of reflection is the somber and lucid teteatete of the subject with itself The specific seriousness of Baudelaire s work is located here It prevented the poet from truly assimilating the Catholic worldview which could be reconciled with allegory only under the aegis of play Writer   This remark contains the seed of an important insight about Baudelaire s relation to traditional Catholicism because it shifts the question from one of adopting or abandoning that view to one of the impossibility of assimilating it The latter formula is strongly indicative of the kind of theological engagement disengaged from both belief and religious practice but persisting in more than merely metaphorical form that I have been attempting to demonstrate in Baudelaire The silent term of the dialogue as Benjamin presents it A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  here is the idea of redemption the other major stumbling block to Baudelaire s ability to assimilate the Catholic worldview which depends in its entirety on not just the possibility but the actual assurance of redemption Benjamin begins to hint at the fact that what is at stake in Baudelaire is neither a surpassing of the theological nor a simple reversal of Christianity in favor of Satanism but rather a coming to terms with the elimination of redemption and whether or not that ultimately culminates as Benjamin implies here in the solipsism of a self in an endless loop of dialogue with only itself Benjamin advances tentatively in the terrain of redemption s translation into the world of the modern inquiring for instance about the status of fashion Fashion is the eternal recurrence of the new Yet can motifs of redemption be found specifical y in fashion Writer   The question remains open unanswered an invitation to uncompleted further reflection rather than a definitive statement that there can in fact be a modernity infused with the remnants of a redemptive theology a question to which Baudelaire seems to answer a more definitive no than Benjamin is willing to grant And indeed the question about fashion precedes by only a few pages the aphorism I have already cited that asserts that redemption depends on the tiny fissure in the continuous catastrophe   Much is at stake in the tiny fissure since it is clear from the paragraph that precedes this contention that Benjamin is thinking of redemption not only in a theological but also a political sense The concept of progress must be grounded in the idea of catastrophe That things are status quo is the catastrophe   The fissure then is the interruption of the everthesame the time that is according to the Theses on the Philosophy of History shot through with chips of Messianic time Illuminations   Benjamin s political theology is clearly skeptical about the possibility of the redemption that is evoked here only hypothetical y under the sign of dependence on a fissure whose existence is not asserted categorical y by Benjamin Nevertheless even that tentative hypothetical redemption would not hold when tested against Baudelaire s more categorical refusal of redemption In the fragments of the Arcades project there are traces of theological investment in Baudelaire but never a direct intervention in the question of redemption Given the incomplete nature of the project we should resist the urge to impose a unity on the assembled notes that form the project as it has come down to us I will therefore look to a few key moments that illustrate the tension between Benjamin s earlier theological orientation and his later materialist one to examine the degree to which he takes into account the full consequences of Baudelaire s asoteriological vision At certain times Benjamin seems to be working to banish the theological from his own thinking on Baudelaire by radically secularizing the poet himself Thus we read the following remark on the abyss which will as we shall see later in this chapter be essential for Benjamin Fondane in his own reading of Baudelaire With Blanqui the cosmos has become an abyss Baudelaire s abyss is starless it should not be defined as cosmic space But even less is it the exotic space of theology It is a secularized space the abyss of knowledge and of meanings Arcades   Given the highly theological nature of Benjamin s speculations about knowledge and the  The Fall Out of Redemption fall that we explored in the last chapter and given the immediate relevance of the fall to Baudelaire s poetry it is surprising to see the abyss of knowledge equated here to a secularized space While the space of knowledge is certainly not theologically traditional it would be difficult to justify a reading of Baudelaire s abyss as thoroughly secular Yet at another moment Benjamin cites without comment the following assessment by Gonzague de Reynold from  comparing Francois Villon to Baudelaire In the one we find the mystical and macabre Christianity of an age in the process of losing its faith in the other the more or less secularized Christianity of an age seeking to recover its faith cited in Arcades   One might object that what many early twentiethcentury critics of Baudelaire had trouble articulating is the fact that Baudelaire s view can be said to be neither secular nor Christian for while it is steeped in the more than metaphorical vocabulary of God and Satan its refusal of some of the most basic tenets of Christianity make it very difficult to apply that label even with the qualification of an unconventional Christianity Further evidence of Benjamin s struggle to articulate Baudelaire s point of view and of further grappling with the categories of secularization and Christianity with regard to Baudelaire can be seen in this comment which renews the theological imperative that the fragments I have quoted above seem to want to reject To interrupt the course of the world that was Baudelaire s deepest intention The intention of Joshua From this intention sprang his violence his impatience and his anger from it too sprang the everrenewed attempts to cut the world to the heart or sing it to sleep  In this intention he provided death with an accompaniment his encouragement of its work Arcades  words in brackets in original In contrast to the dismissals of the theological evident in other fragments this one returns to that realm in ways that bring us round once more to Benjamin s ever present notion of redemption visible here in the interruption of the world which echoes the everthesame which Benjamin labels catastrophe and which messianic time would interrupt We remember that messianic time is extrahistorical thus representing an interruption rather than an immanent moment within time In this fragment Benjamin comes closest to the idiosyncratic theology we have been tracing in Baudelaire most notably in the emphasis on the impossibility of any redemptive action on the part of the poet intentionality here does not translate to possibility and thus death is the only effective solution Baudelaire s interruption of the course of the world would be not a redemptive political act but rather a reduction to nothingness which carries the label death only if death is understood to lead to no afterlife In this sense Benjamin s notion of petrified unrest is pertinent to Baudelaire In the Arcades fragments he returns at several points to his study of Trauerspiel to sketch points of connection between that earlier work and his thought on Baudelaire He refers to the image of petrified unrest as the bleak confusion of Golgotha Arcades  and attempts to historicize it A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  In the final analysis the image of petrified unrest called up by allegory is a historical image It shows the forces of antiquity and of Christianity suddenly arrested in their content turned to stone amid unalloyed hostilities Arcades   At this point we need to raise a crucial question about the possibility of historicizing petrified unrest A brief detour through Theodor Adorno s work will give some context to this question Adorno famously writes in Minima Moralia that the only philosophy which can be responsibly practiced in face of despair is the attempt to contemplate all things as they would present themselves from the standpoint of redemption Adorno   Retaining a notion of redemption as Benjamin does would require stepping outside of history via the messianic moment in order to be able to contemplate things from that standpoint Leo Bersani points out that Adorno affirms the utterly impossible nature of any such philosophy because it presupposes a standpoint removed even though by a hair s breadth from the scope of existence whereas we well know that any possible knowledge must not only be first wrested from what is if it shall hold good but is also marked for this reason by the same distortion and indigence it seeks to escape Adorno  quoted in Bersani   Bersani goes on to critique the persistence of the redemptive not only in Benjamin but also in the culture of contemporary criticism which is drawn so strongly to Benjamin according to Bersani because of its own attachment to a logic of redemption The disease of modernity more profoundly of history that Benjamin analyzes is first of all and perhaps last of all the disease of his perception of modernity The redemptive need in Benjamin s critique of the moderns condemns that critique to a kind of mystified morbidity it always has to be a question of truth breaking in on or being made to emerge from degraded phenomena degraded by virtue of their very phenomenality It is tempting to see Benjamin s great popularity today as a sign of our complicity in such mystifications It is perhaps more pointedly a sign of the extraordinary hold on our thought of the culture of redemption For in Benjamin we find the traits most deeply characteristic of the culture the scrupulous registering of experience in order to annihilate it and the magical and nihilistic belief that immersion in the most minute details of a material content will not only reduce that content but simultaneously unveil its hidden redemptive double Bersani  Here again the persistence of categories such as annihilation and resurrection cannot but echo a secularized Christian logic of redemption precisely the logic that Baudelaire rejects Francoise Meltzer has also pointed to differences between Benjamin s and Baudelaire s approaches to questions of history and especial y the possibility of historical perspective Meltzer identifies a double vision in Baudelaire that sees before and behind but is incapable of seizing and therefore of conceptualizing the present moment This double vision not only prevents an overview panoramic discernment or perspective but puts him into a solipsism that sees in historical events and in capitalist culture more fodder for his conviction that progress wil  The Fall Out of Redemption eventual y atrophy the spiritual part Meltzer   The prophetic here cancels the possibility of a historical vision in ways not unlike those that we identified with Adorno s comments on the standpoint of redemption In both cases the missing and impossible stance the present moment for Meltzer the extratemporal messianic point for Adorno cal s into question the ability to think historical y in ways on which Benjamin depends As I have been attempting to show Benjamin thus also depends on a messianic viewpoint that is adamantly refused in Baudelaire when the poet cancels the possibility of redemption and invites reflection on how we might think beyond and without it Meltzer develops her comparison between the two in terms of exhaustion Benjamin comes from an era in which nostalgia has lost both its purpose and the luxury necessary for its indulgence If anything poetry and the poetic serve for him as vehicles to the disaster of human events So Benjamin himself resembles the angel of history in that he can see things in horror from something like an aerial perspective he sees accumulation not depth Baudelaire s man is exhausted not horrified He sees his own life not history Meltzer  A Baudelairean reading of Benjamin then would challenge the messianic viewpoint that would allow Benjamin to play the role of angel of history and would give priority to the metaphysical conditions enumerated by Baudelaire which to be sure manifest themselves historical y but could not definitively be shown to be defined by that history The philosophical stakes of Baudelaire s writings cannot be reduced to a historical approach paradoxical y perhaps because such an approach seems to depend on a messianic vision thus suggesting the priority of theological considerations Baudelaire s writings shift the terrain back to the primacy of the theological by radical y redefining what it might mean to think theological y without a notion of redemption from and hence also removal from history Benjamin s reflections on Baudelaire sometimes hint at the problem of time and its nonlinear manifestations especial y in Benjamin s comments on the poet as brooder which Benjamin opposes to the philosopher Baudelaire was a bad philosopher a better theorist in matters of art but only as a brooder was he incomparable Arcades   The difference between a thinker and brooder is that the former not only meditates a thing but also meditates this meditation of the thing The case of the brooder is that of the man who has arrived at the solution of a great problem but has then forgotten it And now he broods not so much over the matter itself as over his past reflections on it The brooder s thinking therefore bears the imprint of memory Brooder and allegorist are cut from the same cloth Arcades  Here we are close once again to the notion of contemplation and contemplation of evil that reinforced the importance of original sin in Baudelaire Brooding removes A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  the subject not only from action but also from historical progression by becoming a metacognitive act wherein the subject is trapped and forced to turn in on himself While the thought bears the imprint of memory it is not simply an act of memory but rather a cyclical back and forth between past and present from which there can be no escape no removal no forwarddirected thought or action In the completed writings on Baudelaire Benjamin does not push these reflections to their full theological consequences even though in the Arcades fragments he has his eye on the theological stakes Though Baudelaire likes to appeal to Catholicism his historical experience is nonetheless that which Nietzsche fixed in the phrase God is dead In Nietzsche s case this experience is projected cosmological y in the thesis that nothing new occurs any more In Nietzsche the accent lies on eternal recurrence which the human being has to face with heroic composure For Baudelaire it is more a matter of the new which must be wrested heroical y from what is always again the same Arcades  Benjamin intriguingly suggests the possibility not of the fullblown atheology that the phrase God is dead may imply but rather of the remainder of the Catholic God who for Baudelaire does not save On this reading we can see Baudelaire proposing avant la lettre a reading of the rest of Nietzsche s famous utterance which goes on to assert and we have killed him Gay  since along with that death our possibility for redemption is canceled as well Under Baudelaire s asoteriological logic the effort to wrest the new from the always the same is bound to fail insofar as the new is always pulled back to the same without the messianic moment that would endow the new with value and distinguish it from the rest Benjamin here assimilates Baudelaire to his own salvific vision of the role of the critic summarized thus by Richard Wolin For Benjamin the philosophy of history becomes Heilgeschichte the history of redemption and the task of the critic or later that of the historical materialist is that of rescuing the few unique visions of transcendence that grace the continuum of history the nowtimes Jetztzeiten  from the fate of oblivion which incessantly threatens to consume them  To preserve a record of such nowtimes the function of historical remembrance is the ultimate end of the method of redemptive criticism Wolin   Baudelaire s thought refuses the possibility of the poet or critic playing this role not least because the role of brooder which Benjamin assigns to Baudelaire precludes the possibility of the heroic action he might hope to accomplish There is another reader of Baudelaire in the s and early s whose life like Benjamin s was cut short by Nazi barbarism Romanianborn French literary critic and poet Benjamin Fondane s last book Baudelaire et l experience du gouffre Baudelaire and the Experience of the Abyss  on which he was at work from  to  was completed but not revised by the author before he was deported from France and exterminated at AuschwitzBirkenau on October   His lengthy and complex study of Baudelaire eclipsed by the debate around JeanPaul Sartre s  The Fall Out of Redemption existentialist biographical reading of the poet published shortly after Fondane s study appeared posthumously Sartre s Baudelaire was published in January  and Fondane s book a few months later  is informed by a complex network of philosophical and theological thinkers and writers including Pascal Kierkegaard Nietzsche and Kafka It provides an important counterpoint to Benjamin s reading of Baudelaire one that accounts in ways that Benjamin s does not for Baudelaire s asoteriology and its consequences for his worldview as it emerges in his writings Fondane s study of Baudelaire is like Benjamin s writings on the poet the culmination of a long engagement with the relationship of literature to philosophical questions Despite this longstanding investment in Baudelaire over approximately the same time period Fondane and Benjamin did not know each other nor did they refer to each other s works Teboul   While both thinkers engage with the theological stakes in Baudelaire in order to il uminate larger questions of the significance of the poet s works there are important differences between the two Walter Benjamin considers that the il usory theological halo of the legend of the author of the Fleurs du Mal must be total y dissipated whereas Benjamin Fondane makes Baudelaire s religious experience a central stake in his analytical discourse even if the emphasis is often on the Satanic diverting of Christianity In Benjamin the poet never seems important as an individuality and his flaneur is an anonymous face emerging for a brief moment from the wave of the crowd in order to signify that the modern artist draws the essential aspect of his vocation from the streets of the great capitals In Fondane to the contrary the street and urban modernity are absent and his Baudelaire is rather a poet of the depths of the self than a poet of the exteriors of the city PopCurseu   The critics differing emphases generate two quite different lists of touchstone poems to which each critic returns again and again and which acquire a kind of emblematic status As Ioan PopCurseu has indicated while Benjamin s Baudelaire is the poet of Le cygne A une passante Perte d aureole Le vin des chiffonniers Les sept vieillards and Le soleil The Swan To a Woman Passing By Loss of Halo The RagPickers Wine The Seven Old Men and The Sun Fondane s poet comes to us through poems such as L irreparable L irremediable De profundis Le gouffre Une charogne and Un voyage a Cythere The Irreparable The Irremediable De profundis The Abyss A Carcass and A Voyage to Cythera  This is not to say that Benjamin succeeds in finding the true modernity of Baudelaire the poet of urban experience while Fondane seeks to perpetuate the poet as a practitioner of art removed from his historical context Quite to the contrary Fondane argues against Paul Valery s and TS Eliot s influential readings of the poet in order to situate him in a philosophical context that engages with important voices in antisystematic philosophical approaches to literature in the s and s Fondane does not ignore the poet s situation in the urban nightmare of his time his reading however gives precedence to A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  metaphysical concerns that manifest themselves in but are not determined by the poet s historical context  I turn below to Fondane s work on Baudelaire in order to illustrate the way it engages with Baudelaire s asoteriology and provides an important counterpoint to Benjamin s approach Since Fondane is a less wellknown thinker than Benjamin I would like to begin by situating his work on Baudelaire in the context of an earlier collection of essays La conscience malheureuse The Unhappy Consciousness   which outlines key aspects of his approach Fondane s is an eclectic approach that defies simple categorization While influenced by Lev Chestov his work like Benjamin s cannot be said to fall neatly into a philosophical school nor does it attempt to be systematic in its approach In La conscience malheureuse he argues against Marx but not from what could be labeled a politically conservative stance Rather he groups Marx together with Hegel as thinkers who place too much stock in reason as the force of historical progress Fondane s project is to rejuvenate a metaphysical approach to conceptualizing both art and history at a time when political forces were rendering visions of historical progress less tenable while giving credence to thinkers of anguish nothingness and the gouffre all of which go on to inform his reading of Baudelaire some eight years later This is not to say that Fondane defends antihistorical thinking Combien evanescente et precaire que soit le trame des evenments historiques politiques et economiques force nous est de lui consentir une presence redoutable Et sommesnous libres de n en pas tenir compte Nous sommes a la fois en tant que citoyens du malheur social des etres poltiques et en tant que citoyens du malheur humain des etres metaphysiques However evanescent and precarious the web of historical political and economic events may be we must grant it a formidable presence And are we free to not take it into account We are as citizens of social discontent political beings and as citizens of human unhappiness metaphysical beings Conscience x  It is not for Fondane a question of opposing metaphysical or historical approaches to art or philosophy but rather of refusing to grant priority to the historical in such a way that the metaphysical would be seen as a mere historical category generating a set of historically determined questions and disappearing given the appropriate historical conditions Il est meme vraisemblable qu une societe absolument debarassee de tout souci materiel si jamais cela arrive soit autrement plus propre que la notre a se livrer totalement et sans arrierepensee a l angoisse metaphysique Tant que la realite sera telle qu elle est de maniere ou d autre par le poeme par le cri par la foi ou par le suicide l homme temoignera de son irresignation dut cette irresignation etre ou paraitre absurdite et folie Il n est pas dit en effet que la folie ne doive jamais finir par avoir raison de la raison xvii It is even plausible that a society absolutely freed of all material worry if ever that were to happen would be better suited in a different way than ours to hand  The Fall Out of Redemption itself over total y and without a backward glance to metaphysical anguish As long as reality remains what it is in one way or another by the poem the shout by faith or suicide man will testify to his refusal to surrender even if this refusal have to be or seem absurdity and fol y It is not established in effect that fol y must not end up triumphing over reason In his interrogation of the way historical and larger metaphysical concerns overlap and in his granting to poetry a privileged status in terms of the insight it provides into those concerns Fondane s approach is akin to that Benjamin but with significant differences that give full import to the metaphysicotheological considerations that determine Baudelaire s relationship to history Je ne nierai pas que la dialectique historique n epuise une partie importante de notre reel mais encore enveloppetelle toutes nos questions ne laissetelle rien de cote I will not deny that historical dialectic exhausts an important part of our real but still does it envelop all our questions Does it not leave anything aside xii  Fondane offers a critique of Hegel Marx and then Husserl on similar grounds of seeking un edifice de certitude qui soit hors d atteinte an edifice of certainty that would be invincible xviii  an impossible and falsifying ideal for philosophy This philosophical move is itself Fondane argues based in these philosophers own awareness of the impossibility of certitude and a reaction inspired by fear of anguish absurdity and madness the presence of which systematic philosophers recognize but attempt to conceal by means of the philosophical system thereby creating a reliance on reason which itself becomes a kind of madness xviii  He affirms the need to think religiously and philosophically at the same time in order to generate a full picture of human subjectivity in a way that resists reason s potential for reductionism It is important to specify that like Baudelaire s Fondane s reference to the religious or theological has nothing of an orthodox affirmation of faith in a God and certainly not of the redemptive God In fact Benedetto Croce identified the lack of hope of redemption as one of the key characteristics of Fondane s thought as it is revealed in his study of Baudelaire Croce wrote in  that Fondane s book is exemplary of what Croce calls the new Weltzschmerz of our time whose characteristics he identifies as pain without the light of moral faith and without hope of redemption cited in de Lussy    Like Baudelaire Fondane adopts the vocabulary and structures of religious thought in ways that bracket questions of belief or practice but retain the full force of theology as a mode of thought compensating in Fondane s case for the excesses of reason that led to the positivism of the nineteenth century that Baudelaire deplores and in a conceptual framework that has much in common with Horkheimer and Adorno s dialectic of Enlightenment the catastrophe of the midtwentieth century that Fondane lived and which he attempted to theorize in its full metaphysical force  An important source of theoretical kinship between Baudelaire and Fondane is their refusal of redemption even as they work within the semantic framework of JudeoChristianity One of Fondane s criticisms of Hegel is tellingly what Fondane A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  perceives as a messianic spirit in his thought that tends toward what Fondane views as an impossible reconciliation of the contradictions of consciousness L Esprit de Hegel pretend avoir supprime cet audela il pretend avoir resolu les contradictions de la conscience sa notion qui est pleine raison  a commence ses effets bienfaisants Voici l epoque annoncee messianique de l apaisement infini apres une contradiction infinie L homme est devenu grand a trouve sa propre unite il se reconnait fils de Dieu que disje Dieu luimeme  The Spirit of Hegel claims to have canceled this beyond it claims to have resolved the contradictions of consciousness its notion which is full reason has begun its beneficent effects Here is the announced messianic era of the infinite calming after an infinite contradiction Man has become great has found his own unity he recognizes himself as son of God what am I saying God himself Fondane identifies Kierkegaard Dostoyevski and Nietzsche as reacting against Hegel s religion du bonheur religion of happiness  which obliges us to adopt reason as our master even though it proves itself to be mechant coercitif indifferent a l homme mean coercive indifferent to man   Using Hegel s own notion of the master slave dialectic which prevents happiness so long as it exists Fondane argues that Hegel s approach to reason as master assures the persistence of the dialectic This is not to say that happiness can be found by renouncing the systematic philosophical tradition but rather that the combination of theological and philosophical reflection that Fondane promotes yields a more lucid understanding of human subjectivity which cannot be redeemed by faith reason art or any other potential y saving force Like Baudelaire Fondane is led to the narrative of original sin as an important indicator of our relation not only to divinity but to knowledge mortality and redemption Fondane s reading emphasizes the absurd even as the story itself is given as an account of the desire for knowledge Drawing on Kierkegaard Fondane asks comment pourraiton comprendre une chose aussi absurde que le peche How could one understand a thing as absurd as sin   Kierkegaard affirms that God would not tempt humanity and thus we need to assume that Adam was speaking to himself This reading begins to resemble zizek s perverse reading of Christianity that wonders why if the tree of knowledge is forbidden God put it there in the first place Fondane affirms that le recit de la Genese est en effet fonde sur plusieurs nonsens the Genesis story is in fact founded on several non sensical aspects D une part Dieu demande a l homme pose dans un etat d innocence d eviter la connaissance ce qui est contradictoire d autre part l homme agit sous le coup d une menace celle de mourir mais il ne peut savoir ce qu est la mort ici Dieu  The Fall Out of Redemption menace et la le serpent qui est encore Dieu le tente ou serait donc le peche Il faut pour que tout puisse s expliquer que menace et tentation aient lieu dans le seul homme mais ou trouver une categorie psychologique qui nous donne une tentation qui ne serait que la tentation d un rien puisque l innocence exclut le savoir  On one hand God asks man posed in a state of innocence to avoid knowledge which is contradictory on the other hand man acts under a threat that of death but he cannot know what death is here God threatens and there the serpent who is still God tempts him where then would the sin be For everything to be explained it is necessary that threat and temptation happen in the same man but where to find a psychological category that would give us a temptation that would only be the temptation of a nothing since innocence excludes knowledge Sin is redefined on this account as synonymous with knowledge and removed from the arena of choice to that of necessity Or rather Fondane translates the concept of original sin back to its relation to knowledge He affirms Il fal ut donc definir a nouveau le peche originel car au Savoir il etait evident que l on ne pouvait renoncer C est ainsi qu insensiblement on deserta la verite l Eglise logea son peche orighinel dans l acte de chair du moins en pratique un philosophe catholique comme Gilson soutient aujourd hui encore avec l autorite de l Eglise que le peche n etait que de desobeissance que Dieu qui avait tout donne n avait refuse a l homme qu une toute petite chose un fruit de rien du tout Et un theologien juif comme Martin Buber ira plus loin et dira que le peche originel n etait rien d autre que le meurtre d Abel par Cain   It was thus necessary to define original sin once again since it was evident that one could not renounce Knowledge It was thus that without realizing it we deserted truth the Church located its original site in the carnal act at least practical y speaking a Catholic philosopher like Gilson still maintains today with the authority of the Church that sin was only disobedience that God who had given al  had refused to man only one very little thing a little fruit of no importance And a Jewish theologian like Martin Buber will go further and say that original sin is nothing other than the murder of Abel by Cain Since knowledge is irrevocable and unredeemable we are condemned to unhappiness by our very nature as knowing beings Given that the desire to know and the fact of knowing are part of what it means to be a human subject there is no choice but to know and thus no choice but to sin At the same time that sin is unredeemable since an elimination of knowledge would also alter the fundamental character of our humanity making the human into something else altogether rather than redeeming the human itself The temptation once we are conscious of knowledge as synonymous A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  with sin is not toward sin but away from sin since L homme est tente avec le concours de l angoisse par le Rien Man is tempted with the aid of anguish by the Nothing   This is where Fondane s thought intersects in important ways with Baudelaire s since the poet is ultimately tempted not by Satanism but by the possibility of the Nothing which reveals itself in poems such as Obsession to be an impossibility an inconceivable category on account of our condition as knowing beings which Fondane helps us to define as synonymous with unredeemable original sin Dieu a vu juste qui disait que nous allions mourir mais le serpent a vu juste aussi qui disait que nous deviendrions pareils aux dieux Il ressort donc de la cette consequence effrayante que pour qu il y ait Esprit il faut qu il y ait le peche Notre liberte n est que de mourir Et le courage pour l angoisse devant la mort est la supreme sagesse de l etre authentique God saw correctly when he said that we were going to die but the serpent saw correctly when he said that we would become like gods What comes from this then is the frightening consequence that for there to be Spirit there must be sin Our freedom is only freedom to die And the courage for anguish in the face of death is the supreme wisdom of authentic being   It is in this way that Fondane revitalizes and justifies his intellectual engagement with the myth of the fal  now effectively removed from its traditional Judeo Christian context and introduced as a way to enact the introduction of theological thinking into an otherwise secular philosophy This allows him to avoid the danger of an overreliance on reason that fails to give an adequate account of the persistence of metaphysical problems manifested in but not limited by and certainly never resolved by history Chaque fois que la philosophie entreperend de fonder de legitimer ou de justifier ses sources ses pouvoirs ses droits autonomes elle se heurte a quelque ecueil l Urgrund irrationnel irreductible de Schelling reapparait et ce n est pas seulement un fragment rebarabatif de reel qui refuse de se laisser penser c est le reel en sa totalite qui ne se laisse pas penser Que l on se soit resolu l evanouissement de ce reel au profit de la seule raison et que cela ait effectivement eu lieu tout le long de l histoire de la philosophie ne supprime pas la contradtiction comme il le semble  Each time that philosophy undertakes to found legitimate or justify its sources its powers its autonomous rights it bumps up against some stumbling block the irrational irreductible Urgrund of Schelling reappears and it is not only a rebarbarative fragment of the real that refuses to let itself be thought it is the real in its totality that does not let itself be thought That one has resolved the fainting of this real to the advantage of reason alone and that that would in fact take place all through the history of philosophy does not cancel the contradiction as it would seem to This reassignment of the theological allows Fondane to critique systematic philosophy and its ultimate optimism inadequate to the task of accounting for metaphysical  The Fall Out of Redemption anguish while refusing at the same time to resort to traditional antimodern theological accounts of human sinfulness equal y inadequate in their reliance on God transcendence and redemption for the coherence of that explanation  What Fondane admires in Kierkegaard and Heidegger alike is the aspect of their thinking that he cal s une theologie sans Dieu a theology without God   a label he applies to any adequate metaphysics It is the task of metaphysics properly understood to theorize without attempting to resolve unredeemed mortality under whatever labels varying modes of thought may apply to it la finitude la mort le malheur continuellement mates ne cessent de faire leur reapparition nous sommes dans un monde de gachis et ce gachis appele ou non faute peche conscience malheureuse Urgrund

egalement en rond autour d une theologie positive ou negative  finitude death hardship continual y suppressed never cease to reappear we are in a mess of a world and this mess whether or not it is called fault sin unhappy consciousness Urgrund il usion nonetheless continues to be the grand philosophical matter Whether one constitutes oneself like Kierkegaard as the general advocate of the divine or like Freud as the general advocate of renunciation we turn round in circles around a positive or negative theology These are the complex parameters in which Fondane is operating in his study of Baudelaire Mircea Martin has described the difficulty a reader initial y has in placing Fondane s Baudelaire book within an established genre while the title might indicate a biography there is also the exploration of literary history as well as its social context both of which along with certain biographical elements are put in relation with the stages of its creation Martin   Martin goes on to ask Do we have here studies or essays Is it the critique of a professional or of a poet Is it a critique of Baudelaire s poetry or his philosophy Does this critique come from a poet or a philosopher Martin   Martin s rhetorical questions set the stage for Fondane s analysis which does in fact situate itself at the intersection of the literary criticism philosophy and poetry Fondane s book differs substantial y from Sartre s where Baudelaire s biography is taken for a kind of case study of bad faith by which Baudelaire had in fact deserved his suffering  As Olivier SalazarFerrer indicates nothingness and the related concept of the gouffre function quite differently in Fondane and Sartre Fondane s nothingness as opposed to Sartre s which is engendered by the ontological structure of the foritself designates the inconsistency of rational cognitive ethical or esthetic representations of idealism The abyss is thus A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  the apperception the vision of the inconsistency of rational and idealist convictions accompanied by the idea that the totality of rational representations only constitute a set of appearances L ambivalence  In what follows I seek to revitalize Fondane s philosophical y inflected reading of Baudelaire by demonstrating the ways in which it accounts for his refusal of redemption More specifical y Fondane does this by coming to terms with the poet s unprecedented use of the category of the neant as a state toward which to aspire as a corrective to the ultimately fruitless gesture of satanic revolt and as the only alternative in a world bereft of anything we could recognize as the Christian God Such a philosophical approach does not negate a historical one both implicitly and explicitly Fondane s reading of Baudelaire in the context of a France occupied by the Nazi forces that would exterminate Fondane himself engages with the political stakes of the metaphysical vision he traces Fondane s Baudelaire et l experience du gouffre is as I have suggested an unclassifiable book Monique Jutrin describes the experience of reading it this way From his first approach the reader finds himself plunged into a thick and dense work  chapters without titles or epigraphs where thought develops in a spiral returning indefatigably to itself He does not know what Minotaur awaits him or what Ariane guides him Everything seems aimed at losing him and misleading him even though he senses that he is being led somewhere Certain leitmotifs are perceived as signals citations from Dante Baudelaire insistent citations as are the recurrent motifs of the monad without doors or windows the allegory of the live rat or the opposition between thinking and feeling Relecture  Fondane does not seek to transform Baudelaire the poet into a philosopher but rather identifies the necessity of the move toward and through philosophy in order to emerge as a poet once more C est precisement pour pouvoir demeurer poete et non pas philosophe qu il fal ait devenir philosophe et combattre afin d arracher la poesie a la definition qui en faisait une experience fausse et lui restituer le droit que Pascal demandait pour la philosophie pure d etre une recherche en gemissant It is precisely in order to be able to remain a poet and not a philosopher that it was necessary to become a philosopher and do battle in order to tear poetry away from the definition that made of it a fake experience and to restore to it the right that Pascal claimed for pure philosophy to be a seach while moaning BEG   Poetry helps establish a corrective to an approach to philosophy as a commitment to progress through reason At the same time Baudelaire s particular approach removes the danger of poetry coming to serve like systematic philosophy as an attempt to cover up the abyss rather than revealing it Baudelaire s art has a disclosive function for Fondane and this in spite of the epigraph slightly misquoted from Baudelaire s Une mort heroique that affirms art s role as throwing a veil over the abyss L ivresse de l art est plus propre que toute autre a jeter un voile sur les terreurs du gouffre  The Fall Out of Redemption The intoxication of art is more proper than any other to throwing a veil over the terrors of the abyss BEG    Paradoxical y even art s attempt to veil the abyss acknowledges its reality in ways that systematic philosophy refuses to do Ni Hegel ni Kant ni Schopenhauer ne nous ont parle d un gouffre et qui subsiterait apres la conciliation du vrai et du reel la philosophie est incapable d admettre l existence du Gouffre et le poete lui est incapable malgre sa bonne volonte  de les ecarter de son drame Neither Hegel nor Kant nor Schopenhauer spoke to us of an abyss that would subsist after the conciliation of the true and the real philosophy is incapable of admitting the existence of the Abyss and the poet is incapable despite his good wil  to cast them aside from his drama BEG   In lieu of consoling fictions or protoStoic removal from reality Baudelaire is forced to confront un reel qui n entend pas ceder a real that does not intend to cede its place BEG   The laying bare of the impossibility of happiness as we shall see relates back to Fondane s earlier reflections on knowledge itself as both original sin and necessary condition of our human being A double will emerges in Baudelaire both to continue and rebel against the fundamental unhappiness that accompanies knowledge and to remove himself from the fight in an equal y impossible desire for nothingness By wishing to be removed from the progression of an individual or collective life Baudelaire also strives to exist outside time both as a metaphysical subject and as a poet Il n est pas comme le dira Eliot en avance sur son temps il est a cote de son temps il est en dehors de n importe quel temps passe ou a venir sa pensee n est ni en retard ni en avance elle est tout simplement extreme  Il lui faut employer de vastes resources pour devenir de son temps pour se situer pour avoir l air banal il lui faut un malentendu Et tout de suite avec une tension inouie il s applique a forger de toutes pieces ce malentendu necessaire Il le forge d autant mieux qu il est le premier a avoir peur de sa propre pensee qu il est le premier a en etre a la fois terrifie honteux et fascine le premier aussi a juger correctement des reactions qu elle est susceptible de provoquer BEG  He is not as Eliot will say ahead of his time he is next to his time he is outside any time at al  past or future his thought is neither behind nor ahead it is very simply extreme  He needs to employ vast resources in order to become of his time to situate himself to seem banal he needs a misunderstanding And right away with unheard of tension he tries to create all of a piece this necessary misunderstanding He creates it all the better since he is the first to be afraid of his own thought the first to be at once terrified ashamed and fascinated the first also to judge correctly the reactions that it is liable to provoke Fondane argues against a reading of Baudelaire that would see him as a product of his historical moment namely a decadence that seeks l originalite a tout prix originality at all costs BEG   For such an originality would remain at the level A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  of the individual the eccentric Art is a hopeless enterprise because there cannot be said to be any salvific value in il usion even in an il usion such as art that knows itself to be illusory Thus the stakes are high in Baudelaire s attempt to pursue art for art s sake Fondane reads this not as an evasion of historical or any other reality but rather as a latent attempt to react against hopelessness even in the full knowledge that the attempt itself is hopeless Le culte de l art pour l art n est pas pour Baudelaire une evasion une fuite facile il est une terrible lutte entreprise sans espoir sans il usions mais entreprise tout de meme desperement pour une realite qu il sait fausse afin d ecarter la seule chose qu il execre mais qu il tient pour reelle le Gouffre De la reussite ou de l echec de cette lutte dependent non seulement l idee que Baudelaire se fait de l art mais aussi celle qu il se fait de la vie de Dieu BEG  The cult of art for art s sake is not for Baudelaire an evasion an easy escape it is a terrible fight undertaken without hope without il usions but undertaken nonetheless desperately for a reality that he knows to be false in order to cast aside the one thing he hates but that he holds to be real the Abyss On the success or failure of this fight depend not only the idea that Baudelaire makes for himself of art but also the one he has about life and God This sense of desperation in the pursuit of art for art s sake as an impossible and il usionfree enterprise is key to Fondane s approach to Baudelaire where the stakes are high for Baudelaire as they were for Fondane as well as he struggled years before with questions of the persistence of meaning or value in the face of God s nonexistence In notes Fondane took in the s he states he no longer believes in God and articulates the full force of such a rejection Dieu luimeme n est qu une hypothese cela s entend Mais c est l hypothese fondamentale dont toutes les autres dependent Supprimez Dieu et a quoi bon se demande l homme a quoi bon l art a quoi bon la patrie a quoi bon la vie Dieu est l hypothese unique qui supprime toutes les questions de ce genre il les condamne les declare des peches desormais aucune question n est plus possible qtd in Avec Benjamin Fondane  God himself is only a hypothesis that is understood But it is the fundamental hypothesis on which all the others depend Cancel God and what s the use wonders man what s the use of art fatherland life God is the single hypothesis that cancels all questions of this sort He condemns them declares them sins henceforth no question is possible any longer God exists more as a category than as a living being that is as the justification of law and the origin of sin Given that Fondane had by the s identified under the  The Fall Out of Redemption conventional label sin the necessary human capacity for knowledge itself the category God remains thoroughly empty of traditional JudeoChristian characterizations in order to become as it did for Baudelaire a function whose necessary absence causes anguish but whose necessary presence generates law sin and punishment As he writes in a personal notebook Nous sommes a une epoque ou peutetre estelle en train de finir dominee par cette absence de Dieu Mais je n entends pas par absence privation J entends par absence un trou un inachevement une nostalgie une presence d absence quelque chose comme un rien solide substantiel createur d actes Tout ce que nous avons ecrit pense edifie ne s etait propose qu un seul but combler un fosse combler le trou que l absence de Dieu avait ouvert dans notre univers qtd in Avec Benjamin Fondane  We are in an era or maybe it is about to finish dominated by this absence of God But by absence I do not mean deprivation By absence I mean a hole an unfinished quality a nostalgia a presence of absence something like a solid substantial nothing creator of actions Everything that we have written thought built had proposed for itself only one goal to fill in a gap to fill the hole that the absence of God had opened in our universe Fondane s mature writings on Baudelaire continue to draw the consequences of the knowledge that God as a personal loving and saving concept has met a definitive end for both Baudelaire and Fondane As Olivier SalazarFerrer has suggested Fondane envisages poetry as the expression of an existential disarray haunted by nostalgia for God Fondane   In the Faux traite d esthetique Fake Treatise of Esthetics  Fondane links poetry to a nostalgia for an older spiritual vision which nonetheless we can no longer find tenable La poesie est le lieu meme spirituel ou le peche a la nostalgie de la foi ou en d autres termes le lieu meme ou la conscience reve de la possibilite d un acte pur libre puissant qui transporterait les montagnes ou creerait le poeme en se jouant Reve legitime En effet la perfection serait de commander a la realite et non de s y soumettre passivement Mais ecrit Gerard de Nerval dans Aurelia L ignorance ne s apprend pas  Faux traite  Poetry is the very place a spiritual one where sin has nostalgia for faith or in other words the very place where consciousness dream of the possibility of the pure free powerful act which would move mountains or would create the poem by deceiving Legitimate dream In fact perfection would be to command reality and not to submit oneself passively But as Gerard de Nerval writes in Aurelia Ignorance cannot be learned Baudelaire s works negate the nostalgic vision of faith in all but its most ghostly traces while retaining the full force of the notion of irredeemable sin As we have seen A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  one consequence of this shift in perspective is to rob satanic revolt of any power as an effective action Such revolt belongs now to the dream of a pure free act that Fondane relegates here to world of nostalgia precisely because of the problem of knowledge which for Fondane is always knowledgeassin The neant emerges in Baudelaire and Fondane as third space beyond heaven and hel  an attempt to see damnation as a dead end without trying to affirm the possibility of redemption Mais le Neant est une des deux seules issues ouvertes dans l univers de Baudelaire aussi horrifique que soit l Enfer il est aussi peu digne qu il soit de la misericorde ce n est que la cependant qu on la trouve encore c est sur l autre porte sur celle du Neant qui mene a la vertu et a la connaissance autonomes  qu il est ecrit Lasciate ogni speranza voi ch entrate C est la que vont les complimenteurs de l humanite trouver la fausse paix la fausse vertu et la fausse connaissance C est la qu ils s echapperont par la mort a la douleur et par le neant a l Enfer BEG  But Nothingness is one of the only two open exits in Baudelaire s universe as horrifying as Hell is it is as little worthy as he may be of mercy it is nevertheless only there that one still finds it it is on the other door on that of the Nothingness that leads to autonomous virtue and knowledge that it is written Abandon all hope you who enter here It is there that the complimenters of humanity go to find false peace false virtue and false knowledge It is there that they will escape from pain by death and from Hell by nothingness Despite the hopelessness of the neant it is the preferable choice for Baudelaire since it cancels the problem of knowledge and anguish that existence necessarily brings no other stance is tenable if knowledge is affirmed as the unredeemable original sin Not even damnation is capable of canceling the nefarious effects of existence and damnation becomes a threat only because it prolongs existence rather than canceling it Stil  there is a tension in Fondane and Baudelaire alike between affirming the unfruitful and hopeless revolt of Satanism as a rebellion against the neant and affirming the impossible desire to come to rest in nothingness a rest which a conscious subject could never experience precisely because it is impossible for consciousness to experience nothingness On one hand En un univers ou le neant commence aux portes de la pensee il n est d affirmation que celle qui nie en un univers sans paradis il faut en toute hate opposer quelque chose au triomphe du Neant et l Enfer qui etait le dernier echelon de l etre dans le monde du Dante devient le premier dans celui de Baudelaire Le je ne veux pas de son rebelle est un acte plus dangereux plus noble que l obeissance et en regard de ce que le damne accepte de perdre vertu paix connaissance  Baudelaire refuse d y voir un lache consentement a ses plaisirs a sa pente BEG   The Fall Out of Redemption In a universe where nothingness begins at the gates of thought the only affirmation is one that negates in a universe without paradise one must in al haste oppose something to the triumph of the Nothing and Hel  which was the last level of being in Dante s world becomes the first in Baudelaire s The I do not want to of his rebel is a more dangerous nobler act than obedience and with regard to what the damned one accepts to lose virtue peace knowledge  Baudelaire refuses to see there a cowardly consent to one s pleasures one s inclination But on the other hand Les valeurs ont change de place La nonactivite l obeissance la recherche de la paix du repos le renoncement ne sont plus a present les caracteristiques du Sage mais celle de la brute ce sont l activite le courage le gout du risque et l Expansion infinie  Vertus du rebelle  qui caracterisent le heros ce heros devenu pour cette raison meme un sacrifie de la vie et un paria de l intellect Values have changed places Nonactivity obedience the search for peace and rest renunciation are no longer at present the characteristics of the Sage but of the brute they are rather activity courage the taste for risk and infinite Expansion Virtues of the rebel which characterize the hero this hero become for this very reason a sacrificial victim of life and a pariah of the intellect BEG   It is harder to make the case for renunciation as a heroic characteristic and rebellion is more frequently figured in Fondane by the active revolt of the Satanist even if that revolt is known in advance to be impossible Stil  Fondane recognizes the temporary character of the desire for active revolt and affirms along with Baudelaire the neant as the only viable if equal y impossible solution The fact that any action is doomed to failure is brought into poignant relief by the historical circumstances in which Fondane was writing his Baudelaire While contemporary politics seldom plays a significant role in his analysis it is undeniably and forceful y present at certain moments Un jour viendra peutetre ou l historien consentira a jeter un regard dans l Histoire sur les formes de l ennui les plus basses C est l ennui qui est la source des changements soudains des guerres sans motifs des revolutions meurtrieres il n est pas de cause plus operante que lui Un besoin se fait jour de se sentir exister de rompre la monotonie de l etre du pur pensable le meurtre la vengeance la joie de detruire pour detruire se donnent librement cours chez un peuple qui il y a un instant semblait tranquille et sage supreme fleur d une civilisaton consommee BEG  A day will come perhaps when the historian will consent to cast a glance in History on the basest forms of ennui It is ennui that is the source of sudden changes war without motive murderous revolutions there is no more operative cause than that A need to exist to break the monotony of being and of the thinkable pure is coming to light murder vengeance the joy of destroying for destruction s sake are having their way in a people who an instant ago seemed tranquil and wise the supreme flower of a consummated civilization A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  Given that the kind of revolt against ennui that we might be tempted at first to label heroic can in fact lead to murderous destruction there are no grounds to affirm satanic rebellion as an effective countermeasure to the knowledge of the necessary insatisfaction of existence ushered in with knowledge Hence the temptation to nothingness is on this account a more genuinely attractive option even though it refuses being and on the surface can even resemble ennui in that both lead the subject toward inactivity The two kinds of inoperativity are however quite different in that the desire for nothingness is still an act of will Insofar as it is an act of will though it dooms itself to impossibility since the willing subject is condemned like the poet in Obsession never to achieve the willedfor nothingness without ceasing to be and thus ceasing to be able to perceive the desired nothingness The traditional Christian view of good vs evil is significantly complicated by Fondane who recognizes that il n y a plus de paradis dans la Comedie de Baudelaire la route du paradis est fermee barree le choix est restreint il n y a plus que le Neant et l Enfer there is no longer any paradise in Baudelaire s Comedy the route to paradise is closed barricaded choice is restricted there is only Nothingness and Hell BEG   By removing redemption Baudelaire eliminates the choice of fidelity to a loving God leaving a choice between satanic revolt and nothingness But by identifying the drive to exist with cruelty he makes it impossible to affirm revolt given the dangerous political risks it necessarily implies The choice is then not one of cruelty or noncruelty but the appropriate victim of the cruelty Via the path of revolt what results is what Fondane calls exterior cruelty inquisitions buchers massacres d heretiques croisades inquisitions stakes massacres of heretics crusades which will be the choice of les ames simples les masses simple souls the masses whereas les ames fines se tourneront contre ellesmemes fine souls will turn against themselves BEG   The selftorturing subject resembles Baudelaire s L heautontimoroumenos although Fondane does not make this connection explicit Rather he highlights the cyclic character of the internal revolt which leads from ennui to attempted revolt and back to what Fondane labels following medieval Christian tradition acedia C est sur un vaste canevas d ennui que l on brodera les cruautes les crucifixions que l on terrassera l ennemi le diable le neant et quand la torture ellememe deviendra impuissante quand l imagination sera epuisee le tissu primitif reparaitra a la surface et ce sera l acedia It is on a vast canvas of ennui that we will embroider cruelties and crucifixions that we will take down the enemy the devil nothingness and when torture itself becomes powerless when imagination is exhausted the primitive fabric will reappear at the surface and it will be acedia BEG   Fondane emphasizes that this is not just the mystics absence of God but is also the absence of the devil as well car il n y a plus rien la ou regne l ennui l immuable l immobile since there is no longer anything there where ennui the unchangeable the immobile reigns BEG   Here the boundaries of Fondane s terms become blurred since while there is nothing rien where there is ennui this cannot be the same nothing as the neant which is precisely the desired but impossible state that the subject would hope to reach in order to be free of the circular selftorturing Fondane has just described  The Fall Out of Redemption To be is to suffer according to Fondane and not just in a cliched romantic sense Rather suffering is the very proof of existence not only of the human subject but of the divinity and Fondane reads Christianity s emphasis on the crucified Christ as its attempt to establish a valid basis for belief in a divinity whose existence can only be guaranteed if it is witnessed as suffering Il faut exister pour croire il faut que ce a quoi l on croit soit existant non pas pense seulement mais senti et non pas pensant seulement mais sentant De la peutetre la foi du moyenage au seul Dieu crucifie Il fal ait faire souffrir jusqu a la mort le moteur immobile d Aristote pour lui rendre un semblant de vie Il fal ait tuer l Ennui et donc le Logique sic  jusqu en Dieu BEG   One must exist in order to believe it is necessary that that in which one believes exist not only thought but felt and not only thinking but feeling From there perhaps come the Middle Ages faith in the one God crucified It was necessary to make Aristotle s unmoved mover suffer unto death in order to give him back a semblance of life It was necessary to kill Ennui and thus the Logical even all the way to God If the distance between God and humanity is leveled both beings operate by a similar logic motivated by ennui which we can see in the tyrannical God of Le reniement de saint Pierre described as like un tyran gorge de viande et de vins qui s endort au doux bruit de nos affreux blasphemes a tyrant gorged with food and wine who falls asleep to the sweet sound of our horrible blasphemies  OC   as well as in the figure of Ennui itself in Au lecteur famously dreaming of the scaffolds en fumant son houka as he smokes his hookah pipe     Fondane acknowledges after this provocative exposition that to illustrate his thesis about the eruption of violence and cruelty as a misguided attempt at rebellion against ennui he has chosen un exemple extremement complique et sujet a de multiples interpretations an extremely complicated example that is subject to multiple interpretations BEG   a danger he would have avoided by focusing on the descent of the Roman empire and the cruelty of figures such as Caligula and Nero What Fondane leaves unsaid is that such an example would fail to map onto the political situation under which he was crafting these ideas with all of the secular theological implications of the metaphysical tradition with which he is engaging and for which he is attempting to account We cannot help but be tempted sometimes to affirm being over nothingness but we are repulsed by the necessary affirmation of cruelty that must accompany it as the only alternative unless we accept the task of desiring nothing and the selftorture of its impossible accomplishment Given the expressly nonsystematic nature of Fondane s thought there is no simple answer about whether there is a redemptive vision in his analysis but I contend that he goes further than most commentators on Baudelaire toward accounting for the A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  poet s lack of redemption Fondane only rarely appeals explicitly to the vocabulary of redemption One such instance comes fairly early in his study of Baudelaire La haine qu il a pour son moi n est pas seulement philosophique elle est sainte aborrecimiento santo de si mismo tout comme pour saint Jean de la Croix Vaincre et nier son moi le salut est a ce prix Dans sa passon idealiste il apporte aussi la passion moyenageuse dantesque catholique mystique le bien le mal ont pour lui encore un contenu une epaisseur le vide qu il cherche n est pas un vide pur mais les tenebres son esprit aussi bien que son corps BEG  The hatred that he has for his self is not only philosophical it is holy holy hatred of oneself as it was for Saint John of the Cross Salvation comes at the price of vanquishing and negating one s self In his idealist passion he brings also the medieval Dantesque Catholic mystical passion good and evil still have content and thickness for him the void that he seeks is not a pure void but darkness his spirit as well as his body Seeking is not the same as finding and the affinity that Fondane highlights between the Catholic mystical tradition and Baudelaire s thought is a starting point rather than an ending If dark emptiness is the goal we have seen that it is impossible to fulfill as the darkness in Obsession for instance is also canvases    to the poet s horror And once again we encounter the paradoxical situation whereby the pure void would be imperceivable because there would no longer be a subject there to perceive it The fact that we can imagine such a redemption without being able to achieve it turns it into a temptation and a source of anguish thereby removing its salvific quality Stil  Fondane seems to struggle with the implications of this vision he elucidates in Baudelaire Even as he enumerates Baudelaire s position there is a certain anxiety as to how to avoid despair in the face of an impossible belief in grace Il n est pas toujours certain que Baudelaire croit autant qu il le dit au peche originel et a la grace qui peut nous en sauver mais ce qui est certain c est qu il voit dans le peche originel la seule cause possible de la misere humaine et dans la Grace la seule issue possible de cette impasse On peut certes n y pas croire Baudelaire luimeme n y croit pas toujours mais comment peuton n y pas croire sans desesperer BEG  It is not always certain that Baudelaire believes as much as he says he does in original sin and in the grace that can save us from it but what is certain is that he sees in original sin the only possible cause of human misery and in Grace the only possible exit from this impasse One can certainly not believe in it Baudelaire himself does not always believe in it but how can one not believe in it without despairing  The Fall Out of Redemption The question is left open for Baudelaire and Fondane alike and at any rate Fondane does not present evidence of where Baudelaire makes room for grace even if it be a grace in which one cannot believe Fondane rightly goes on to link the impossibility of redemption to Baudelaire s contempt for those complimenters of humanity who affirm that human beings are born good a contempt that Fondane sees as both a reminiscence maistrienne Maistrean echo and a souvenir de son education catholique memory of his Catholic education and a sentiment original personnel embrasse avec haine et violence vecu original personal sentiment embraced with hatred and violence lived by Baudelaire BEG   While at first glance it is difficult to see how this idea could be both derivative and original this line of thought brings us back to the difficulty inherent in describing Baudelaire s engagement with theology As I have tried to make clear Baudelaire is certainly not drawing on conventional Catholicism but nor is he simply borrowing terminology from theology in order to subvert it Likewise the question of belief is equally thorny here while Baudelaire uses theological terminology in more than a metaphorical way the essential question is not whether Baudelaire could be said to believe in God What matters most is rather that he uses such terms for their conceptual and explanatory value in his reflections on broader metaphysical questions relating to issues such as evil knowledge and progress It is on account of that particular usage of the theological register that problems at the foundations of traditional theology can be said to be of secondary importance to Baudelaire As Fondane notes C etait peu de chose a ses yeux que le paradis fut perdu ce qu il voulait c est qu il fut perdu a jamais que l on renoncat a y penser Et c est le consentement a cette perte qui se donnait pour la grande vertu et l unique moyen de redemption Bien entendu en lieu et place du paradis perdu le penser logique permettrait un etat ou le conflit qu il enegendre serait aboli un paradis futur mais non plus sacre mais profane Ce paradis est fait de resignation d indifference de detachement du fruit il est paye de l abandon non de le pensee aberrante et subversive mais de la pensee innocente et libre ce n est que le triomphe final de ce rien precisement qui s est introduit on ne sait comment dans le monde de la purete et en a pourri l essence BEG   It is of little importance in his eyes that paradise was lost what he wanted was that it be lost forever that we renounce thinking about it And it is the consent to this loss that offered itself as the greatest virtue and the only means of redemption Of course in place of the lost paradise logical thought would permit a state where the conflict it engenders would be abolished a future paradise but no longer sacred but profane This paradise is made of resignation indifference and detachment from the fruit it is bought by the abandoning not of aberrant and subversive thought but of innocent and free thought it is only precisely the final triumph of this nothing that worked its way we do not know how into the world of purity and rotted its essence A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  Here once again redemption is evoked only under the sign of its ultimate impossibility because it depends on an impossible forgetting of lost paradise the same kind of oblivion that Fondane and Baudelaire elsewhere label nothingness Such radical renouncement would require the elimination of knowledge tout court and the result is according to Fondane anything but a paradise Pour que ce triomphe fut assure il nous fal ait desormais surveiller jusqu a nos moindres demarches nous faire constamment une sorte de violence bref bannir jusqu a la nostalgie jusqu au regret de ce que par le peche originel l humanite avait rejete de son sein C est on le voit le contraire d un paradis un etat d extreme tension d effort exaspere de maximum de conscience vivant dans la terreur perpetuelle de voir s ecrouler sa fragile construction a la merci d un regret  C est en cette terreur que la pensee speculative la theologie et jusqu a la psychanalyse et la critique poetique s entetent a voir le souverain bien Mais que ce souverain Bien fut un rien un effort heroique dans le vide un effort inhumain et non ontologique cela evidement ne tombait pas sous les sens Ne pouvaient le voir que ceuxla seuls qui se souvenaient d un monde non seulement perdu mais trahi et souille BEG  For this triumph to be assured we had from then on to be vigilant over even our most insignificant moves constantly to do a sort of violence to ourselves in short to ban even nostalgia and the regret for that which by original sin humanity had rejected from its breast It is we see the opposite of a paradise a state of extreme tension of exasperated effort of a maximum of consciousness living in the perpetual terror of seeing crumble one s fragile construction at the mercy of a regret  It is in this terror that speculative thought theology and even psychoanalysis and poetic criticism stubbornly insist on seeing the sovereign good But that this sovereign Good be a nothing a heroic effort in the void an inhuman and nonontological effort that evidently was not perceivable The only ones who could see it were those who remembered a world not only lost but betrayed and sullied Baudelaire s insight is then to be able to see the neant as a good but without postulating it as an attainable ideal The question remains as to how such thought is sustainable without falling into despair or becoming tempted by what turns out to be the false redemptive option of revolt Thought s lucidity about its own condition of possibility that is knowledge precludes its satisfaction through anything but an impossible abolishing of itself What Fondane theorizes as terror here becomes the link among philosophy theology and poetry and marks or categorizes the extreme tension that in the condition of lucidity replaces paradise What for Baudelaire is a solution however becomes for Fondane another kind of temptation Car le diable n est plus un sophiste ce n est plus la chair qu il tente mais l esprit et a l esprit ce n est pas l orgueil qu il propose et la desobeissance mais le refus de participer a l etre For the devil is no longer a sophist it is no longer  The Fall Out of Redemption the flesh he tempts but the mind and to the mind it is not pride and disobedience that proposes but the refusal to participate in being BEG   While Fondane does not openly advocate revolt against the desire for the neant passages such as this one suggest his reticence to affirm the desirability of seeking it If it were a demonic temptation to seek the nothing then there would no longer be anything distinguishing that temptation from the more conventional kinds of demonic temptations to blasphemy lust for power and so on As Fondane goes on to highlight the problem is once again one of intelligibility Le peche originel envisage comme desobeissance cela etait intelligible  Envisage comme sexualite il est encore intelligible Schopenhauer disciple de l Inde se declare en ceci d accord avec le christianisme mais il ne fait guere bon pour nous de regarder ladessous et de conserver le mythe du peche originel comme une chose pensable  s il proclame avec Nietzsche que la connaissance est douleur et qu il ne nous reste que les verites salutaires des homini religiosi BEG    Original sin envisaged as disobedience such a thing was intelligible  Envisaged as sexuality it was still intelligible Schopenhauer disciple of India declares himself in agreement on this with Christianity but it is hardly good for us to look underneath and conserve the myth of original sin and a thinkable thing if he proclaims with Nietzsche that knowledge is suffering and that all that remains for us are the salutary truths of the religious men The problem becomes one of how to conceive of original sin if it is defined as knowledge itself since such a characterization would allow no move beyond itself no redemptive conceptual moment by which to characterize that which serves as the motor of our desire to characterize it in the first place Any attempt to move beyond this impasse only further implicates us within it This is where violence becomes a tempting option because it is definitive in a way that thought cannot be Baudelaire ne supporte pas que les reponses manquent aux questions les plus claires et les plus distinctes de l homme et il en arrive a hair l homme justement parce que son existence par le seul fait d etre pose de telles questions Il est des questions qu on ne peut etouffer qu en etouffant celui qui les pose En politique comme ailleurs ditil le vrai saint est celui qui fouette le peuple pour le bien du peuple  Baudelaire souhaite au peuple ce meme fouetteur que nous l avons vu se souhaiter a luimeme et pour les memes raisons il s agit de supprimer cette chose inintellgible la disproportion entre la faculte et la volonte entre l idee adequate et la confuse cause exterieure  Il ne doute pas et nous n avons garde d en douter que le bourreau fera son devoir fouettera et tuera  Quant a verifier si cet emploi de la force assurement inintelligible et fort souvent efficace constitue veritablement une reponse aux questions de l homme Baudelaire ne s y arrete pas il est fatigue il est las BEG  A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  Baudelaire does not tolerate that answers are lacking to the clearest and most distinct questions of man and he comes to hate man exactly because his existence by the simple fact of being poses such questions There are questions that one cannot stifle without stifling the one who asks them In politics as elsewhere he says the true saint is the one who whips the people for the good of the people Baudelaire wishes for the people the same thrasher that we have seen him wish for himself and for the same reasons it is a question of suppressing this unintelligible thing the disproportion between the faculty and the wil  between the adequate idea and the exterior cause He does not doubt and we take care not to doubt that the executioner will do his duty will whip and kill  As for verifying whether this use of force assuredly unintelligible and very often effective truly constitutes a response to the questions of man Baudelaire does not linger over that he is tired and weary Fondane s reading of Baudelaire s impulse to violence is anchored not in a simple taste for evil nor in a facile political conservatism inspired by Joseph de Maistre but rather in the epistemological and theological ground of the intelligible Fondane s criterion allows him to collapse the distinction between violence toward the self and violence inflicted on others and for that matter metaphorical and literal violence  since the violent act in both cases is accomplished in the name of repairing the unintelligible Fondane s crucial move here is in the final comment quoted above namely that Baudelaire remains silent on whether such violence constitutes a true response to the questions it intends to answer The implied answer is that such violence belongs to the ultimately unfruitful domain of satanic revolt and thus political action for good or for evil can only perpetuate and never solve or even approach the problem of intelligibility In fact insofar as violence calls out for interpretation it implicates us further in the realm of the intelligible Mais si apres l echec du bourreau et la carence de l ideal il sent se renforcer en lui sa haine contre les hommes et les idees qu estce que ca peut lui faire qu il rende furieux les gens equilibres que nous sommes a qui tout reussit avec ou sans bourreau Il se pourrait que le triste moi incapable de travailler et trop capable de rever helas fut le siege d une verite plus profonde quoique inadequate et obscure Et dans ce cas justement parce que tiraille trouble par l envie l impuissance et la haine Baudelaire verrait plus clair qu avec ses yeux ouverts et sa tete lucide BEG  But if after the failure of the executioner and the inadequacy of the ideal he feels reinforced in him his hatred for men and ideas what can it matter to him that he renders furious the balanced people that we are for whom everything succeeds with or without executioner It is possible that the sad self incapable of working and too capable of dreaming alas was the seat of a more profound truth even if inadequate and obscure And in this case precisely because tugged  The Fall Out of Redemption at and troubled by desire impotence and hatred Baudelaire would see more clearly than with his eyes open and his head lucid It is at this point that Fondane s metaphysical reading can begin to take account of the political violence at play in Europe in the years during which he was writing his Baudelaire Clearly the stakes of the ideas that Fondane is exploring are high and his metaphysical orientation in no way seeks to avoid political implications but rather to inform them and attempt to account for them Fondane directly confronts the most potential y troubling passage in Baudelaire with reference to the historical events of the s Among the fragments of Baudelaire s autobiographical notes we find the following Belle conspiration a organiser pour l extermination de la race juive A fine conspiracy to organize for the extermination of the Jewish race    which Fondane in an effort to mieux comprendre la pensee qui a agite si terriblement notre age better understand the thought that has so terribly agitated our age quotes and about which he adds Belle conspiration motivee Non puisque Baudelaire ajoute immediatement Les Juifs bibliothecaires et temoins de la Redemption Mais quelle belle cruaute inutile Pas meme lache Car Baudelaire ne demande pas mieux on l a vu que d etre alternativement victime et bourreau il lui importe peu d exterminer ou d etre extermine Ce qu il veut c est une belle flambee pour detruire oublier son ennui et on ne peut helas incendier tous les jours Rome BEG   Fine motivated conspiracy No since Baudelaire immediately adds The Jews librarians and witnesses of Redemption But what a fine useless cruelty Not even cowardly For Baudelaire asks no better we have seen than to be alternately victim and executioner it matters little to him to exterminate or to be exterminated What he wants is a beautiful blaze to destroy and forget his ennui and one cannot alas set Rome on fire everyday Since Fondane s reading of Baudelaire situates the metaphysical as primary and thus as determining other areas of his thought that move into ethics and politics Baudelaire s violence while to be taken seriously is also to be taken as ineffective and known by the poet to be so Here we have to distinguish in ways that it is not clear that Fondane always does between two kinds of neant On the one hand the neant is as we have seen the condition that would put an end to the suffering necessarily caused by knowledge which is the way Baudelaire and Fondane have framed original sin Fondane near the end of his Baudelaire seems to use the neant as a different kind of term more associated with what is often referred to as nihilism in terms of a politics bereft of ethical considerations This is a more typical y diabolical kind of neant which like other kinds of diabolical temptations encourages us to take it for something which it is not Tel est le drame qui se noue entre le Neant dont la supreme ruse est de nous persuader qu il est l Etre et l existant qui pour se sentir vivre  pour appeler A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  a lui l Etre aux ailes de gaze  ne sait que recourir a la cruaute Le malheur vague est entre dans le monde le Dieu d Aristote primum movens immobile n a engendre que l Ennui Et alors comme dit Baudelaire A quoi bon ceci A quoi bon cela Si l ideal si l ennui existent que feronsnous de notre moi BEG  Such is the drama that is formed between Nothingness whose supreme ruse is to persuade us that it is Being and the existent which in order to feel itself live  to call to itself Being with its wings of gauze  can only have recourse to cruelty The vague misfortune has entered the world the God of Aristotle immobile prime mover has engendered only Ennui And so as Baudelaire says What good is this What good is that If the idea and ennui exist what will we do with our self This neant finds its outlet in the kind of cruelty that would cut short Fondane s life senseless unredemptive and ineffective in canceling the metaphysical condition against which it is supposedly attempting to combat Nazi cruelty becomes yet another manifestation of the tempting yet ultimately ineffective satanic revolt that Baudelaire practices in his poems singing the praises of the devil If Fondane has rightly observed that for Baudelaire the choice is no longer between paradise and hell but rather between hell and nothingness the kind of political violence Fondane evokes here is more aligned with hel  even though he affiliated it with the neant here than with the nothingness which would be the only effective cancel ation of the ennui brought on by knowledge Seule la cruaute semble temoigner encore du refus absolu de l homme du XXe siecle a supporter l intelligere autonome qui a supprime le soleil et la voie lactee et le triste moi qui a force l homme de crever dans son trou comme un rat empoisonne Si Dieu n existe pas alors tout est permis  crie le vieux Karamazoff si Dieu n existe pas alors homo homini lupus

pour nous ladessous C est la preuve de Dieu par l absurde et nous y sommes tous engages Le regne de la cruaute ne fait que commencer Telle est me sembletil l apocalypse de l Ennui BEG  Alone cruelty seems still to bear witness to twentiethcentury man s absolute refusal to tolerate the autonomous knowledge that has suppressed the sun and the Milky Way and the sad self that has forced man to die in his hole like a poisoned rat If God does not exist then all is permitted cries the old Karamazoff if God does not exist then a man is a wolf for man let s burn Rome exterminate the Jews sacrifice the most elevated types of our humanity God and sin do not cover anything thinkable the intelligence has not ceased telling us that there is nothing good for us underneath It is the proof of God by the absurd and we are all engaged in it The reign of cruelty has only just begun Such is it seems to me the apocalypse of Ennui  The Fall Out of Redemption It is important to emphasize that Fondane is not enumerating a conservative critique that would have us turn back toward a God on account of the absurdity of meaningless cruelty that ensues from claiming his nonexistence He leaves open the question of what could ground ethics in God s absence a question admittedly far afield from his main subject in the Baudelaire book But Baudelaire does take on the role of a kind of prophet here for having articulated the potential consequences of the ennui which he associates from the very beginning of Les Fleurs du Mal with the diabolical It is through Baudelaire that we are invited to draw the consequences of a lack of redemption first among those consequences is any sort of recuperative meaning that could be found in the eruptions of violence that Fondane cal s l apocalypse de l Ennui The question of God s existence is secondary to the fact of the nonexistence of redemption and on this reading the apocalypse cannot redeem but only destroy since it cannot but affiliate itself with satanic revolt rather than the true neant that would be the only way out of the problem of knowledge as sin Fondane s own poetry functions simultaneously on both the historical and metaphysical levels further enhancing the inextricable link between them that he develops in his philosophical writings Neither register is reducible to the other even in the latest poetry that addresses the horror of the deportation and extermination of the Jews Some of his poetry is eerily prophetic especially the work L Exode Super Flumina Babylonis Exodus By the Waters of Babylon  begun in  and subsequently revised throughout the next several years in light of the Shoah At the beginning and conclusion of the work he borrows the biblical form of lamentations each one introduced by a letter of the Hebrew alphabet while the large middle consists of a dramatic poem featuring a reciter a chorus and three other speakers The speaking subject in the preface that Fondane added in  cannot be said to function exclusively as a historical subject nor a metaphysical one Rather the historical and transhistorical come together to inform and influence each other giving metaphysical but not necessarily comforting religious import to suffering Oui j ai ete un homme comme les autres hommes nourri de pain de reve de desespoir Eh oui j ai aime j ai pleure j ai hai j ai souffert j ai achete des fleurs et je n ai pas toujours paye mon terme Le dimanche j al ais a la campagne pecher sous l oeil de Dieu des poissons irreels je me baignais dans la riviere Apres apres je rentrais me coucher cherchant cherchant en vain sur un ventre de femme cette paix impossible que nous avions perdue naguere dans un grand verger ou fleurissait au centre l arbre de la vie Mal  Yes I was a man like other men nourished by bread dream despair Oh yes I loved I cried I hated I suffered A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  I bought flowers and I did not always pay my rent On Sundays I would go to the country to fish under God s eye for unreal fish I bathed in the river After after I would go home and lie down looking looking in vain on the bel y of a woman for this impossible peace which we had lost long ago in a great orchard where in the center the tree of life was flowering As in Baudelaire s poetry God is operative but not necessarily existent in a conventional sense in these poems a reflection of Fondane s ambiguity as to the question of the existence of God which I outlined above The representation of the speaking subject as thoroughly ordinary here in the preface not only throws into relief the horror of the Jewish subject s exclusion in the poems to follow but also gestures toward collapsing the distinction between Jew and nonJew by identifying a metaphysical anguish which as we have seen is common to all humanity in all historical and economic conditions according to Fondane He reiterates this position late in his career in a projected preface to a revised version of his poem Ulysse dating from  Le lecteur naif pourra croire que le poete a puise sa poesie a meme le vecu imminent comme si cela etait possible Mais il est vrai qu un traumatisme actuel qui par essence est destructeur d affectivite creatrice peut reveiller des traumatismes deja anciens deja gueris mais analogues faire jaillir la poesie dans une autre couche plus loin Mal   A naive reader could believe that the poet drew his poetry from imminent lived experience as if that were possible But it is true that a present trauma which in its essence is a destroyer of creative affectivity can awaken former traumas already healed but analogous and make poetry spring up in another layer further on With these words Fondane pleads for a reading that resists the urge to reduce the poetry to the particulars of its historical moment and he seems conscious of the danger of that kind of reductive historical interpretation in light of the extreme historical circumstances in which he was revising his work The doubled interpretation that figures in the prologue then hovers between the particular and universal the historical and metaphysical and it conditions our reading of the entire long poem that follows The second of the three men who speak in the poem recounts an episode of physical flight from those chasing him laden with more abstract implications J ai quitte ma chemise et j ai marche tout nu les pieds ensanglantes par les torrents de pierre  The Fall Out of Redemption mais quelquefois le gouffre prenait la voix d un homme il criait au secours Plus haut plus haut que l homme et cette solitude me donnait la nausee Le doute commenca a ronger ma chair qui donc avait voulu nous tromper de la sorte a qui profitait notre perte pendant que l on montait quelle etait donc la chose que l on voulait nous voir quitter qui donc nous a trompes de soif afin de nous voler la vie et nous jeter transis aux pays de la mort Mal  I took off my shirt and I walked naked my feet bleeding from the torrents of stone but sometimes the abyss took on the voice of a man it cried for help higher higher than man and this solitude made me nauseous Doubt began to eat at my flesh who had thus wanted to trick us that way Who was profiting from our loss while we were climbing what was then the thing that they wanted to see us abandon who thus tricked us with thirst in order to steal our life from us and to throw us chilled with fear to the land of death Transcendence is the temptation here the impossible attempt to go beyond the human Fondane s lyric subject does not like Baudelaire s seek death and the consequent reduction to nothingness but rather wants to resist it to perform the impossible by resisting death and maintaining immortality And yet we can see an important parallel with Baudelaire here in the way God could be said to be playing the role typical y ascribed to the devil here that of the tempter While forcing man on to higher and higher ground the outside force which would presumably be the divinity all the while destines him for death and profits as the poet says from his loss This is not inconsistent with Baudelaire s wish for oblivion in order to avoid the tragicomedy of human existence The parallel with the Baudelairean worldview becomes more pronounced by the end of the poem where Fondane enumerates a series of fourline poems in the form A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  of lamentations In these he returns more explicitly than before in this poem to the question of knowledge as the unredeemable source of human suffering Samech Supreme ivresse de connaitre Voici les ventres d oceans Vagins ouverts qui forcent l Etre Au sperme auguste de Neant Phe De quel cote chercher l Issue Quelle ile suspendue au Rien Deja soleil ta viande crue Saignait aux portes du matin Shin J ai vu la mort compter les morts Elle leur enlevait la graisse Et j ai crie Heureux les Morts Qu avaientils donc besoin de graisse Thav Etaitce bien le dernier jour Pourquoi appelaisje au secours Et de quel oeil dans mon attente Tombait cette larme brulante   Samech Supreme intoxication of knowing Here are the bellies of the oceans Open vaginas that force Being To the august Sperm of Nothingness Phe In which direction to look for the Exit What island suspended upon the Nothing Already sun your raw meat Was bleeding at the gates of morning Shin I saw death counting the dead It was removing the fat from them  The Fall Out of Redemption And I cried Happy are the Dead What need did they have then of fat Thav Was it real y the last day Why was I calling for help And from which eye in my wait Was this burning tear falling The first of these quatrains evokes the eagerness of the Baudelairean subject at the end of Le voyage and hence the end of Les Fleurs du Mal who urges death to take him au fond de l Inconnu pour trouver du nouveau to the depths of the Unknown to find something new  OC   As I shall show in the next chapter this ending is a false lead since it is contradicted by the necessary disappointment that experience brings as that is portrayed in the penultimate poem Le reve d un curieux Given that the elimination of consciousness altogether would be the only way to cancel the suffering induced by human knowledge the intoxication of knowing must be for Fondane an il usion that feeds human discontent And yet this reading while consistent with Fondane s own philosophy is in tension with the way that death is represented in L Exode In the section Samech quoted above death appears rather conventional y as a threat rather than a release But by the end of the poem in the final quatrain Thav consciousness persists thus marking the at least temporary victory over the threat of the neant but not for the benefit of the speaking consciousness who is now represented as alien to himself and presumably trapped in this state of tormented consciousness the anguish of knowledge with which the poem ends This kind of poetic and philosophical vision does not lend itself to tidy conclusions either for Baudelaire or for Fondane for whom an attempt at definitive conclusion would just sink us deeper into a logic that will not provide answers and in fact exacerbates the desire to know that leads us to negative revolt in the first place It is in that sense that neither God nor sin is thinkable for Fondane Is there then any kind of redemptive vision in Fondane Commentators on his Baudelaire are divided on this which is unsurprising given Fondane s refusal of systematic thought By affirming the importance of poetry and the poetic in the elaboration of his vision Fondane invites ambiguity and the participation of the reader in struggling with rather than trying to reduce the questions posed by his thought Mircea Martin emphasizes the disclosive function of art according to Fondane which precludes the redemptive function Art Poetry can no longer be for Fondane solutions of comfort or salvation For him their role is not to cover to throw a veil over the terrors of the Abyss but on the contrary to remove this veil And the Abyss is the Irrational the Absurd Evil the Impasse the Dead End the Unanswered the bewitched silence Martin   A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  The function of art for Fondane is clearer than the function of God about which there is certainly ambiguity in Fondane s reading While we have seen that he declares unbelief in the s and while there is no statement of belief to be found in his later works the role of God in Fondane is as it is in Baudelaire difficult to assign either to the category of existence or to the category of metaphor Olivier SalazarFerrer makes room for a saving God in Fondane Fondane supposes in effect that Baudelaire s God transcends the limits of his theological essence He is thus liable to transgress the principle of non contradiction and to save and even love the damned It is a merciful God who transcends the binary logic of salvation and damnation D un Baudelaire  Fondane does not offer evidence for the prominence of such a loving God in Baudelaire s poems an omission made all the more visible by the indifferent or even tyrannical God that plays a role in so many of the poems that Fondane features in his analysis SalazarFerrer offers a clue as to how to account for the merciful God that appears in Fondane We find here of curse the God of Chestov all powerful who defines himself only by an absolute reign over the possible The fideist attitude resulting from the negative theology of Chestov and Fondane assumes the idea of a merciful God capable of making man participate in his powers and his infinity D un Baudelaire  The mention of Lev Chestov reminds us of the formative influence of that philosopher on Fondane and suggests that a God who surpasses binary logic in order to love the human being may have more in common with a Chetsovian or Kierkegaardian view than with the one being worked out in the late Fondane Given the degree to which Fondane follows Baudelaire closely on metaphysical questions it is unlikely that he could affirm a theology even a negative one that resembles the Christian mystics more than it does Baudelaire s idiosyncratic God And indeed this ultimate impossibility of salvation for Fondane is what Salazar Ferrer goes on to indicate Fondane never accepted the linearity of Christian history marked by a time of a fall from the originary paradise  In his Baudelaire he wanted and demanded the fundamental return to innocence by the grace of poetry or by a magical thought which restored lost childhood to us This is not a Redemption that is on the horizon of this metaphysics but a restitution D un Baudelaire  As SalazarFerrer notes Fondane quotes Jacques Maritain in order to affirm that we must regard the state of innocence as definitively lost qtd   For the Catholic Maritain this loss would be redeemed by the divine sacrifice but since Fondane rejects this possibility he is left to affirm the impossibility of the very state of restitution he theorizes here  The Fall Out of Redemption What remains is the possibility of the grace of poetry a redemptive value not simply revealed by poetry but effected by it This is the salvific function of the artwork that we have already addressed through Agamben s reading of redemption in the work of art and of criticism and to which we shall have occasion to return in a consideration of Friedrich Nietzsche While Fondane claims that Baudelaire s poetry reveals the gouffre rather than throwing a veil over it revelation is quite separate from redemption and it is not at all clear that poetry which remains complicit in the production of knowledge which is at the root of our unredeemed original sin can play any role in restoring a state of innocence This is not to say that poetry plays a merely descriptive role by revealing to us the conditions of the gouffre such a conception is totally at odds with Fondane s conception of poetry s link to lived experience Rather poetry participates in the suffering inextricably allied with the human experience and is one of the best expressions of that suffering In that sense poetry both discloses and expresses that suffering Dominique Guedj reads a kind of redemptive value in that function of poetry for Fondane Truth demands that we do not fear letting misfortune speak without regard for the objective value of judgment brought on the real and it is poietic poetry that can do it beyond the anguish generated by misfortune it restores to man a freedom and a way out Guedj  Poetry undoubtedly brings insight according to Fondane as well as active creation but given Fondane s reservations about even a restitution of innocence not to mention a redemption of experience it is not clear that there is a fullfledged version of hope in this claim that poetry represents a way out of our metaphysical predicament As Fondane had argued in his earlier works history cannot progress because it cannot solve the fundamental metaphysical problems that Fondane claims transcend the particulars of any given historical situation While he allots far greater power to poetry than to reason there is at best a tension between his remarks about the restitution of freedom and the larger direction of his argument about the gouffre While Naziism is for Fondane the absurd fullest extent of a reason informed by a misguided humanism he gives little evidence of believing that simply choosing a different path will allow a way out of the metaphysical predicament he traces Such is the interpretation he offers in one of his last works Le Lundi existentiel et le dimanche de l histoire The Existential Monday and the Sunday of History La faute est peutetre a cet humanisme meme qui avait trop manque de pessimisme qui avait trop mise sur l intelligence separee et divine et neglige plus qu il ne fal ait l homme reel que l on avait traite en ange pour finalement le ravaler audessous de la bete Un humanisme qui n aurait pas surestime la raison n eut certainement pas mis tous les atouts de la science entre les mains de ceux a qui on refuse aujourd hui jusqu au don de la raison Lundi   A Veil Over the Abyss From Benjamin to Fondane  The blame belongs perhaps to this very humanism which had lacked pessimism which had counted too much on the separate and divine intelligence and neglected more than it should have the real man that one had treated as an angel in order in the end to lower him below the beasts A humanism that will not have overestimated reason would certainly not have put all the advantages of science in the hands of those in whom we do not see today the gift of reason Baudelaire s thought unquestionably tempers humanism with pessimism in order to paint a more lucid picture of the human condition than the traditional story of redemption would allow Whether this results in a way out of unhappiness as opposed simply to lucidity about its nature and causes remains ambiguous in Fondane The struggle against despair that is visible in Fondane s analysis of Baudelaire and his poetry suggests that Baudelaire s work serves him as a reminder of the reality of the impossibility of a redemptive vision a possibility that Fondane more successfully and consistently holds in view than Benjamin does While Fondane s poetry gives evidence of a struggle against the realization of that impossibility or a reluctance to accept it his account of Baudelaire s work provides an illustration via such thinkers as Kierkegaard of the way we can transform Baudelaire s asoteriology into a livable vision that neither succumbs to despair and inactivity nor relies on illusion or the traces of a messianic glimmer of hope In that sense I have argued that Fondane accounts better than Benjamin does for Baudelaire s unrelenting insistence on the impossibility of redemption Rather than mourning that impossibility both Baudelaire and Fondane seek a form of thought and action that allows us to come to terms with it With their emphases on different corners of Baudelaire s oeuvre so to speak Benjamin s portrait of the poet as urban prowler and Fondane s exposition of the poet as metaphysical subject illuminate different but complementary aspects of the Baudelaire s work An important question to consider however is the primacy of the historical or the metaphysical in Baudelaire s own vision Given the importance Baudelaire accords those theological notions which he revises radically but never abandons and on which so much of his oeuvre depends Fondane s account allows us to give full weight to Baudelaire s notion of original sin in ways that Benjamin s does not While never losing sight of historical considerations at play in Baudelaire s thought Fondane s analysis grants metaphysical considerations their full weight in Baudelaire whereas as we have seen Benjamin s often subordinates them while never fully eradicating a theological perspective one that in important contrast to Baudelaire s retains soteriological notions that Baudelaire cannot entertain If Baudelaire preserves the notion of original sin even while harboring serious doubts about the very existence of God it is because it has the potential to render human experience intelligible As we will see in the last chapter in the prose poem Le mauvais vitrier The Bad Glazier Baudelaire prefers theological accounts to medical ones when it comes to attempting to explain otherwise unexplainable human actions but even those explanations do not ful y account for or explain the behavior in question operating rather as one hypothesis among others albeit for  The Fall Out of Redemption Baudelaire a more plausible one As I have demonstrated above Fondane highlights Baudelaire s intolerance of unintelligibility and locates Baudelaire s temptation to violence in an impossible attempt to cancel that unintelligibility Benjamin s notion of shock can be considered in this same light but Fondane s account takes us beyond the level of everyday lived experience in order to infuse those experiences with their full metaphysical weight in ways that do justice to Baudelaire s frequent meditation on questions of violence subjectivity evil and intelligibility outside the specific context of modern urban experience In our own attempts to render Baudelaire s words intelligible Fondane provides an essential perspective that allows us to take a step beyond shock experience while at the same time refusing tidy answers that are content to remain at the level of traditional theological certainty The tension between certainty and uncertainty and between intelligibility and its opposite along with the way that Baudelaire s doubled ironic subjectivity negotiates that terrain are a vital part of what makes his poetry continual y worth revisiting in our own attempts at rendering modern experience intelligible  Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire In the last chapter Fondane helped us articulate the relationship of a philosophical y inflected lived experience to Baudelaire s poetry and to see a dynamic relationship between the two that neither depends on a simple biographical reading of the poet nor sees the poetry as a mere il ustration of a worldview Rather a more complex model emerges that involves the poetic working out of a worldview a back and forth between a poetic metaphysics and a metaphysical poetry that refuses systematic approaches and that can therefore be difficult to summarize or even articulate precisely In this chapter I would like to develop the ways in which the theological and the poetic are intertwined in Baudelaire drawing not only on the foundation that Fondane helped us establish but also the work of Giorgio Agamben particularly his notion of the end of the poem Endings are common ground between theology and poetry both of which give shape to experience by defining an end point an observation which brings us back to the notion of the messianic In continuing to draw conclusions from Baudelaire s refusal of a logic of redemption I will examine the ways Baudelaire confirms challenges or extends Agamben s analysis of the end of the poem which Agamben anchors in poetics and theology and which allows him to put forward the ways in which they influence each other Agamben s discussion of ends is informed by his notion of messianic time which is not the end of time but rather the time that time takes to come to an end or more precisely the time we take to bring to an end to achieve our representation of time Time   This is derived from Paul s notion of living in the end times the final days before rather than the time of the coming of the messiah What is crucial for our purposes here is that such a notion does not depend on the actual arrival of the messiah and thus it is compatible with the asoteriological vision we have been tracing Like Baudelaire s conceptions it borrows from Christian theology without reproducing its essential element and thus widens the application of that new perspective on theology far away from Christianity but not toward a ful y realized secularism Furthermore Agamben s own work on the philosophy and theology of messianic time is never divorced from esthetic considerations and most often explicitly poetic considerations The poem is therefore an organism or a temporal machine that from the very start strains toward its end A kind of eschatology occurs within the poem itself But for the more or less brief time that the poem lasts it has a specific and unmistakable temporality it has its own time Time   Poems become a sort of microcosm of messianic time in that they both are meant to drive on toward  The Fall Out of Redemption their end while at the same time resisting that end hence the straining toward the end Dante s preferred rhyme scheme of terza rima a favorite example of Agamben s il ustrates this wel  with rhyme in general calling for a next line with which to rhyme while the end of the poem necessitates breaking the pattern in order to be able to end Agamben enlists Baudelaire as another example of the difficulties a poem can have in coming to an end citing Le Cygne and its sudden interruption via the bien d autres encor many others too  of the last line OC   The disorder of the last verse is an index of the structural relevance to the economy of the poem of the event I have called the end of the poem As if the poem as a formal structure would not and could not end as if the possibility of the end were radical y withdrawn from it since the end would imply a poetic impossibility End  Poetry must go on in order to remain poetry otherwise it fal s into prose or into silence Thus the very condition of its existence precludes its own ending even as it is driven toward that ending from the beginning of the poem The end of the poem is thus catastrophic for Agamben in that the reversion to prose brings about the end of the comingtoanend that was the poem If there is a parallel to be drawn with messianic time as the time of coming to an end and the poem as a structure destined from the beginning to find its end  prose then comes to mark the moment of annihilation of messianic time as it is conceived in the poetic event The defining feature of poetry for Agamben is thus enjambment which cal s into question the stability of the single line of verse as a unit of meaning by displacing the end of the unit in which sense is to be found For what is enjambment if not the opposition of a metrical limit to a syntactical limit of a prosodic pause to a semantic pause Poetry will then be the name given to the discourse in which this opposition is at least virtual y possible prose will be the name for the discourse in which this opposition cannot take pace End  The concept of the end has rich implications for the relation between poetry and metaphysics that we have been tracing in Baudelaire via Fondane especial y in the ways in which it discourages an opposition between esthetic or poetic concerns and larger philosophical matters or between form and content Rather on this view poetic form would be the actualization of ideas of the end that the poetry puts into play Agamben poses the question Why does poetry matter to us End  and claims that typical y responses to this question are divided between those who affirm the significance of poetry only on condition of altogether confusing it with life and those for whom the significance of poetry is instead exclusively a function of its isolation from life End   Agamben wishes to think beyond this opposition in ways that resonate with the analysis that Fondane develops and which as we saw when first introducing it defies easy classification as literary analysis philosophy biography and so on as it draws on Baudelaire s poetry as we might say a tool to think with Agamben for his part appeals to what he cal s Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  the experience of the poet who affirms that if poetry and life remain infinitely divergent on the level of the biography and psychology of the individual they nevertheless become absolutely indistinct at the point of their reciprocal desubjectivization And at that point they are united not immediately but in a medium This medium is language The poet is he who in the word produces life Life which the poet produces in the poem withdraws from both the lived experience of the psychosomatic individual and the biological unsayability of the species End  Thus it is important to underscore that for Agamben as for Fondane it is not a question of producing what is typical y labeled biographical criticism There is in fact scant reference to the events of Baudelaire s life in either critic s analysis Rather both seek to redefine lived experience in light of its direct relationship to the poetic act and in the relation of that act to the creation of a philosophical worldview with theological implications that will underwrite and inform anything we would like to say about the poet s relation to lived experience historical events or political participation All of these it is important to note pass through the experience of poetic creation and the metaphysical implications it creates by its own status as an event  Agamben underscores the priority accorded to the poem over the life that on first glance seemed to generate it by appeal to a historical example It is good not to forget that in Romance literature narrative at least in the sense of short story is born as the razo an explanatory note at beginning of some medieval poetry relating it to the poet s life of lyric poetry It is thanks to the poetic word s unspeakable dwelling in the beginning that something like lived experience is made for the narrator This is the novel a that he limits himself to exemplifying End  Lived experience is thus not prior to but coexistent with and to a large extent determined by the poet s dwelling in language a condition that is laden as language itself is with theological concerns as Agamben indicates just prior to the passage I have quoted by a reference to the opening of the prologue of John s gospel In the beginning was the word The language of the poem and the experience embodied in and created by that language emerge from nothingness at the start of the poem an observation Walter Benjamin makes about Baudelaire in particular near the opening of the Central Park fragments where he observes without further elaboration The special beauty of so many of the openings of Baudelaire s poems lies in this a rising up from the abyss Writer   The question shifts with Agamben from the beginning to the end If Baudelaire s poems arise from the abyss for Benjamin and if for Fondane they are an exploration of the abyss itself with Agamben we can pose the question of what it means to ask about the possibility of the end of the abyss Do Baudelaire s poems return to the abyss from which they emerged from silence to silence If a poem strives toward its own end are Baudelaire s poems carried along by the desire to seek the abyss once more as if language were a curse  The Fall Out of Redemption and a return to silence the most desirable alternative The same kinds of questions that we have asked in earlier chapters about the status of the neant in Baudelaire return here under the more specific guise of the poem itself which we can now read as intimately linked to the metaphysical vision that we have been discussing Baudelaire s poetic subject actively seeks the neant in a system where existence can only be seen as a temptation a source of torment that can only be corrected by being brought to an end not by being redeemed by art or anything else On this view the poetic act itself participates in the fall by its use of language which does not give voice to but actual y helps to further the effects of the fall and to plunge us deeper into our unredeemable experience And yet Baudelaire s subject is still sometimes tempted by the lure of the new as the end of Le voyage enacts There is then for the poet both as subject and as poet ie as the subject speaking in the poem and as the creator of that subject s voice  the same ambivalence as the one at play in Agamben s characterization of the poem as that which both strives toward and resists its own end What the poet who wishes to affirm the poetic act at some level ultimately expresses then is not so much the desire to write which implicates the poet in furthering the consequences of the fal  as the desire to have written to have passed through the stage of creation in order then to be freed of it and to achieve the desired neant from which no poetic discourse could truly spring Now the theological consequences of writing for Baudelaire are beginning to become clearer Theology does not simply provide the poet s raw materials a tradition ripe for variation but rather is intimately wrapped up in the poet s characterization of the act of creation itself The way Baudelaire ends his poems wil thus be of central importance for the full elaboration of the worldview we have been tracing And indeed important commentators on Baudelaire s poetry have noted the peculiar quality of his endings and particularly those of some of his masterpieces Marcel Proust for one claimed that Le voyage like Le cygne stops short almost fal s flat quoted in End   which Agamben notes as his main example of the problematics of the ending of the poem as he conceives it On the heels of this modern example Agamben looks back to Dante s De vulgari eloquentia On Eloquence in the Vernacular and its comment on the final verses of a poem The endings of the last verses are most beautiful if they fall into silence together with the rhymes Agamben asks What is this falling into silence of the poem What is beauty that fal s And what is left of the poem after its ruin End   With these questions we are solidly back on Baudelaire s territory which Agamben leaves unpursued beyond the passing reference to the endings of Le voyage and Le cygne Theorizing silence in terms of a fall allows us to continue to probe the relation of the poetic and the theological as it is manifest in Baudelaire for whom all of our reality is conditioned by the fal  What would be the theological consequences of falling now not into language but into silence What would it mean to come to a cadence to come to rest And would that rest be an abyss or an escape from that abyss Agamben takes great care to emphasize that the questions he is pursuing force us to avoid separating what he cal s the semantic and the semiotic current End   or what we might also term the form and content of the poem These two systems work Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  jointly in Agamben s theology of the poem according to which the poem functions as something that slows and delays the advent of the Messiah that is of him who fulfilling the time of poetry and uniting its two eons would destroy the poetic machine by hurtling it into silence End   Agamben goes on to inquire But what could be the aim of this theological conspiracy about language Why so much ostentation to maintain at any cost a difference that succeeds in guaranteeing the space of the poem only on condition of depriving it of the possibility of a lasting accord between sound and sense End  The space of the poem is thus a space of tension between sound and sense two elements which should present a unity but cannot help but be perceived in duality There are strong echoes here of Baudelaire s divided poetic subjectivity of the homo duplex the person divided by virtue of the fal  against himself by simultaneous postulations toward God and Satan a contradiction that cannot be resolved by a redemptive act but must remain in tension so long as the poem continues The falling of the poem into silence in what we could call a theology of poetic form in the double sense of the genitive of would thus not bring about the desired reconciliation of the tension but like the onset of the neant merely obliterate the contradiction by obliterating all of existence By classifying the end of the poem as a fall into silence the fall itself is doubled since we have not a falling and a rising but rather an initial fall into language followed by a second fall into silence the cancelation of which could only be another manifestation of the fall into language or what we otherwise call the beginning of another poem Even the falling into silence of a single poem is not for Agamben a gesture of finality In a remark on the continued tension between the semiotic and the semantic which is consistent with Baudelaire s theory and poetic practice Agamben notes that the double intensity animating language does not die away in a final comprehension instead it col apses into silence so to speak in an endless falling The poem thus reveals the goal of its proud strategy to let language final y communicate itself without remaining unsaid in what is said End  The key poetic techniques by which language communicates itself as poetry are enjambment as we have already seen and rhyme to which Agamben also attributes a theological status Rhyme understood in the broad sense of the term as the articulation of a difference between semiotic series and semantic series is the messianic heritage Paul leaves to modern poetry and the history and fate of rhyme coincide in poetry with the history and fate of the messianic announcement Time  Agamben provides the example of Holderlin s reflections on the leavetaking of the gods which corresponds to the breakdown of closed metrical form in his poetry  The Fall Out of Redemption Baudelaire s case is different in that while he begins to write in prose poetry he never definitively abandons verse and does not significantly alter patterns of rhyme and meter in his late verse This is consistent with Baudelaire s theology which unlike Holderlin s does not announce God s death or departure but rather rewrites theology to exclude redemption The messianic moment never arrives in Baudelaire not because he shifts from theology to atheology but because redemption is simply not possible Thus for all of the affinities we have seen between Agamben s conception of theological poetics and Baudelaire s poetic practice there are some differences In addition to the one just noted Agamben s insistence on the goal of poetry as being as cited above to let language final y communicate itself is in tension with Baudelaire s poetry which always retains and indeed depends on the possibility of a poetic subjectivity that is not merely the pure agentless communication of language While this subjectivity is tortured ironic and fragmented it is nonetheless always present which is further evidence of the impossibility of proceeding via poetry or any other means to the neant in Baudelaire Even if it is so as Agamben contends that poetry s goal is in fact to let language communicate itself Baudelaire demonstrates the impossibility of fulfilling that goal of completing the fall into silence as opposed to remaining endlessly within that fal  There is also divergence between Baudelaire and Agamben on the question of the redemptive value of the poem itself Agamben suggests based on an analysis of the sestina form that he extends to every poem that the poem is a soteriological device which though the sophisticated mechane of the announcement and retrieval of rhyming end words which correspond to typological relations between past and present  transforms chronological time into messianic time Just as this time is not other to chronological time or eternity but is the transformation that time undergoes when it is taken for a remnant so too is the time of the sestina the metamorphosis that time undergoes insofar as it is the time of the end the time that the poem takes to come to an end Time   As I have argued while the comparison of the transformation from chronological to messianic time to the temporal space of the poem holds in the case of Baudelaire it does not necessarily follow that the poem operates as a soteriological device since in the case of Baudelaire s poetics as in his esthetics and his theology the moment of redemption never comes Not merely held in potentiality or virtuality it is never even announced suggested or prefigured The end of the poem is thus not redemptive in Baudelaire s case despite the transformation of time that his poems like those of others perform To return to the question we posed above what would it mean in Baudelaire to come to a cadence to come to rest And would that rest be an abyss or an escape from the abyss Here a difficulty arises analogous to our incapacity to view the world from beyond messianic time from what Adorno labeled the standpoint of Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  redemption Messianic time as Agamben describes it is the time it takes for time to come to an end not the actual end of time nor the time beyond time which is necessarily inconceivable to us In a similar way if we were to perceive the poem s coming to rest that in no way cancels the abyss as it is represented in Baudelaire s poetry since to perceive the end means that there is still a consciousness present to perceive and thus the problem of consciousness as the source of anguish remains unaltered In order to find some consolation in the coming to cadence of the poem we as readers would have to cease to exist along with the poem itself So to Agamben s tension between the semiotic and the semantic we can add another tension between the poem which must come to an end and the eternity of the perceiving subjectivity for whom there can be no end that can be recognized as such This then is the tragedy performed in Les Fleurs du Mal the endlessly futureoriented subject in search of the nouveau at the conclusion of Le voyage in conflict with the subject condemned to eternity despite a desire to come to an end in a nothingness even more final than death One could say then that given the theological conditions of the impossibility of redemption as Baudelaire traces them it is impossible for him to come to an end Fondane had already suggested as much when he made a distinction between unjust societies which can be changed and the fundamentally unjust conditions of human experience no matter what the particular historical conditions may be Ah qu il serait bon de ne vivre qu en une societe injuste afin de la pouvoir corriger dans le sens revolutionnaire et non dans un monde injuste que l on ne peut corriger et qui nous afflige de maladie de secret d impuissance et de mort Qu il serait bon de vivre en un monde ou l on puisse conclure Mais Kleist Baudelaire Rimbaud ne peuvent pas conclure C est la leur tragedie non une voluptueuse tragedie  mais la tragedie pure et simple Faux traite  Ah it would be good to live in just an unjust society in order to be able to correct it in the revolutionary sense and not in an unjust world that one cannot correct and which afflicts us with sickness secrets impotence and death It would be good to live in a world where one could conclude But Kleist Baudelaire Rimbaud cannot conclude That is their tragedy not a voluptuous tragedy but tragedy pure and simple While Fondane speaks of concluding in the sense of drawing conclusions in a rational argument with a gesture toward a systematic philosophy there are important implications as his list of literary figures rather than philosophers suggests for the notion of concluding a literary work here as wel  Fondane recognizes the tension between the impossibility of concluding that he has just asserted and the fact that poems do conclude Poets he concedes concluent puisqu ils ecrivent des poemes conclude since they write poems Faux traite   Poetry since Baudelaire and Rimbaud is marked by the demystificatory aspect that gives the lie to a poetic  The Fall Out of Redemption conclusion that would also be a definitive conceptual conclusion an acceptable solution to the problem of existence as Fondane has defined it through his analysis of Baudelaire How then to conlude within poetry even under the condition of the original sin of knowledge as Baudelaire did as opposed to beyond it as Rimbaud chose to do Faux traite   As Agamben has helped us to see there are high and highly intertwined poetic and theological stakes in a consideration of how poems end and all the more so in the work of a poet like Baudelaire for whom the theological plays such an important role What then can we say about the way poems end in Baudelaire I will examine poems that offer several kinds of models of an ending including the two that served as the ending of Les Fleurs du Mal as a whole To begin let us consider L irreparable which takes up several of the thematic aspects we have been considering in Baudelaire in a form that repeats the first line of each stanza at the stanza s conclusion The first stanza poses a question that prepares the development of the nine remaining stanzas Pouvonsnous etouffer le vieux le long Remords Qui vit s agite et se tortil a Et se nourrit de nous comme le ver des morts Comme du chene la chenille Pouvonsnous etouffer l implacable Remords   Can we stifle the old the lingering Remorse That lives quivers and writhes And feeds on us like the worm on the dead Like the grub on the oak Can we stifle implacable Remorse  This structure encourages us to see each stanza as a closed unity while the question posed pushes the poem on toward an answer thus replicating the tension that Agamben identifies between the poem s desire to come to an end and its tendency to defer that end With each stanza the return to the first line at the end gives the effect of an echo a revisiting of familiar territory unaltered by the intervening development which suggests a temporality that paradoxically remains still even in its movement Baudelaire uses a similar structure of a repeating line to close each stanza in other poems of Les Fleurs du Mal such as Reversibilite Reversibility and Moesta et errabunda Grieving and Wandering  In those two poems the pattern of repeated lines is never altered In Le Balcon The Balcony the pattern is broken only in the final stanza where the line Ces serments ces parfums ces baisers infinis is transformed into o serments o parfums o baisers infinis O vows O perfumes O infinite kisses  a gesture which provides closure to the poem paradoxical y by slightly altering rather than confirming the pattern of repetition that had been established in Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  the preceding five stanzas In L irreparable by contrast the pattern is broken earlier and in increasingly less subtle ways In the second stanza there is an alteration of the punctuation only Dans quel philtre dans quel vin dans quelle tisane Dans quel philtre dans quel vin dans quelle tisane OC  In what philtre in what potion what wine   The fourth stanza introduces the first semantic change a cet agonisant que le loup deja flaire Et que surveille le corbeau a ce soldat brise s il faut qu il desespere D avoir sa croix et son tombeau Ce pauvre agonisant que deja le loup flaire   To this dying man whom the wolf already scents And whom the crow watches To this broken soldier if he must despair Of having his cross and his grave This poor dying man whom the wolf already scents  And the sixth stanza provides a more substantial alteration from the first to the last line L Esperance qui brille aux carreaux de l Auberge Est souffle est morte a jamais Sans lune et sans rayons trouver ou l on heberge Les martyrs d un chemin mauvaus Le Diable a tout eteint aux carreaux de l Auberge   Hope that shines in the windows of the Inn Is snuffed out dead forever Without the moon without light to find where they lodge The martyrs of an evil road The Devil has put out all the lights at the Inn  This change is significant as the last line cancels the idea of hope presented in the first by introducing in his only appearance in this poem the Devil We need to be cautious about an overly facile interpretation of this stanza If what the Baudelairean subject aspires to is nothingness then hope which looks forward to a future only prolongs existence rather than driving it toward its end leaving the subject in a  The Fall Out of Redemption prolonged state of expectation for something which as we shall see in Le Reve d un curieux is destined to disappoint On this view the Devil s action of extinguishing hope and with it a form of desire that will necessarily remain unfulfilled would represent a welcome step toward the desired neant if not for the fact that in this case the consciousness persists thus blocking the move toward nothingness This doubled sense of an end without a true end is echoed in the form of the poem itself as this stanza the sixth of ten suggests the possibility of an ending by its significant break with the pattern of repetition established in the first five while at the same time refusing actually to bring the poem to an end The form thus enacts the ending which is not an ending the extinguishing of hope without the corresponding desirable neant that is at stake in the content And after this stanza the poem does begin again in the following stanza with another question Adorable sorciere aimestu les damnes Adorable sorceress do you love the damned     repeated verbatim at the close of the stanza The play between the verbatim repetitions and the altered final lines establishes a new set of expectations for a pattern since we now notice a pattern beginning at the start of the poem of three stanzas with exact or nearly exact repetition followed by one stanza of slight alteration A cet agonisant quoted above  then a stanza of exact repetition followed by a significant repetition L Esperance quoted above  Once the poem begins again after the reference to the Devil having extinguished hope we have what appears to be a reprise of the larger pattern of repetition and difference since the next three stanzas feature as the first three had exact repetition of the first line in the last line If that whole largerscale pattern were to repeat itself the result would be a twelvestanza poem since the first cycle developed over six stanzas Baudelaire violates the expected pattern of repetition however by bringing the poem to an end earlier than the expected twelfth stanza After the three stanzas that include identical repetition of the first line in the last the final stanza features a near total transformation of the first line in what is the final line of the poem Moreover the last stanza is the only one that is syntactical y inseparable from the preceding one an enjambment between the two making it impossible for the last stanza to stand on its own as a unit of sense J ai vu parfois au fond d un theatre banal Qu enflammait l orchestre sonore Une fee al umer dans un ciel infernal Une miraculeuse aurore J ai vu parfois au fond d un theatre banal Un etre qui n etait que lumiere or et gaze Terrasser l enorme Satan Mais mon coeur que jamais ne visite l extase Est un theatre ou l on attend Toujours toujours en vain l Etre aux ailes de gaze OC  Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  Sometimes I have seen at the back of a trite stage Enlivened by a deeptoned orchestra A fairy set ablaze a miraculous dawn In an infernal sky Sometimes I have been at the back of a trite stage A being who was only light gold and gauze Throw down the enormous Satan But my heart which rapture never visits Is a playhouse where one awaits Always always in vain the Being with gauze wings  The theatrical allusion is a new element introduced in these final stanzas but the circumstances in which the poem was composed indicate that the entire scenario was inspired by a theatrical feerie fairy play entitled La Bel e aux cheveux d or The Beauty with the Golden Hair in which Marie Daubrun played the title role  The theatrical context accounts for some of the more mysterious references earlier in the poem such as the sorciere sorceress evoked in the third and seventh stanzas More importantly however the theatrical context provides a contrast between the melodramatic conventional story of good triumphing over evil which is the Christian narrative of redemption and the more complex situation that Baudelaire describes here The miraculeuse aurore miraculous dawn of the penultimate stanza is revealed to be a fabrication an impossible coup de theatre and when Satan makes an appearance in the final stanza it is not the actual Devil that had figured in the sixth stanza but rather a theatrical Satan The plot of the feerie ends then before the poem describing it ends The half stop of the semicolon in the second line of the final stanza pushes the poem along to its conclusion a conclusion confirmed by the neartotal transformation between the first and last line of the final stanza And yet the finality implied by this break in the formal pattern is counteracted by the semantic content of the final three lines which open onto an eternal waiting The seemingly definitive ending which came toward the middle of the poem as the Devil extinguished hope is replaced at the end by an eternally deferred ending an impossible ending that makes the semiotic end of the poem a mere indication of the impossibility of its actual ending This opening at the end of the poem shares key features with several other of Baudelaire s most characteristic endings of poems most notably Le reve d un curieux which also features a theatrical metaphor for a mental landscape and Le voyage both of which I shall analyze further below The repeated toujours of the final line underscores the contrast between the formal poetic closure and the opening of the poem onto eternity in this case an eternity of sameness This kind of open ending is not infrequent in Baudelaire the most famous case being the series of objects of the poet s thought in Le cygne Je pense aux matelots oublies dans une ile Aux captifs aux vaincus a bien  The Fall Out of Redemption d autres encor I think of the sailors forgotten on some isle Of the captives of the vanquished of many others too     We find a more metaphysically inflected end in L heautontimoroumenos Je suis la plaie et le couteau Je suis le soufflet et la joue Je suis les membres et la roue Et la victime et le bourreau Je suis de mon coeur le vampire Un de ces grands abandonnes Au rire eternel condamnes Et qui ne peuvent plus sourire   I am the wound and the dagger I am the blow and the cheek I am the members and the wheel Victim and executioner I m the vampire of my own heart One of those utter derelicts Condemned to eternal laughter But who can no longer smile  Like Le cygne this poem risks falling into an endless series as the poet enumerates a long sequence of opposites The continuation of the penultimate stanza s series of enunciations in the first line of the final stanza at first seems to confirm the continuation of the series albeit with a variation in syntactical structure The dash inflicts a formal violence on the series a forced removal of the poem from the eternal sets of opposites into which it has fallen But as in L irreparable the lines that enforce closure on the poem do so in ways that open it onto eternity This closure is not real y one after al  since one set of eternal repetitions the enumeration of opposites is replaced by another eternal this time the laughter that Baudelaire in his essay De l essence du rire associates with the satanic The laughter here is that of fallen humanity which without redemption remains trapped in an eternal fal  a persistence of sameness which is one form of the gouffre we explored in Chapter  and which only the neant could effectively cancel And this despite Baudelaire s assertion in De l essence du rire On the Essence of Laughter that there is some kind of redemption to be had in laughter C est avec le rire que l homme adoucit quelquefois son Coeur car les phenomenes engendres par la chute deviendront les moyens du rachat It is with laughter that man soothes his heart sometimes for the phenomena engendered by the fall will become the means of redemption OC   This redemption can only be temporary though a passing moment in the general y eternal fal  just as any notion of a unified self Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  will be shown in L heautontimoroumenos to be a temporary and false conception whereas the permanently enduring sense of self is the one that is eternal y doubled As Michele Hannoosh has pointed out for Baudelaire the movement that surpasses the comic is itself an essential y comic one affirming unequivocal y the comic nature of the abolsute the fallenness and humanity of the ideal   and thus we can say that the very logic of the comic mitigates any permanence in the redemption of laughter by laughter which becomes a move that only implicates us further into the fall that is marked by the comic The poetic assertion of the eternal y doubled subject in L heautontimoroumenos finds its confirmation in De l essence du rire as wel  In the essay Baudelaire claims that perception of the self as doubled is rare in the essay he claims it is reserved not to the poet but to the philosopher Ce n est point l homme qui tombe qui rit de sa propre chute a moins qu il ne soit un philosophe un homme qui ait acquis par habitude la force de se dedoubler rapidement et d assister comme spectateur desinteresse aux phenomenes de son moi It is not at all the man who fal s who laughs at his own fal  unless he be a philosopher a man who has acquired by habit the strength to double back rapidly on himself and witness as a disinterested spectator the phenomena of his self OC   To be at all is to be caught conscious or not in the eternal laughter and to cancel being would also cancel the doubled subjectivity that gives birth to this poem This fact highlights the unusual status of poetry for Baudelaire Agamben had indicated that the poem both strives for and seeks to resist its own ending in this poem however the double consciousness represented as a sadomasochistic self relation implies a desire to end whereas the end at which we arrive effectively cancels the possibility of the end of subjectivity by the indication of the condemnation of the subject to eternal laughter Like the subject itself then the end of the poem is relentlessly double it ends only by indicating the eternal impossibility of an end thus resolving the tension between ending and resisting an ending by making both continuing and ending come to the same result that is an eternal continuation  By ending it continues via an end that can never come to an end This challenges the very definition of cadence as a resting point or what Agamben cal s a falling into prose at the end of a poem since the fall enacted and represented by this poem is not a fall into anything but rather an eternal fal  How then does Baudelaire address endings when it is a question not of an individual poem but of the collection Les Fleurs du Mal a work whose final section La Mort Death explicitly invites reflection on the connections among the end of the poem the end of the collection and the end of a life The  and  editions of Les Fleurs du Mal end quite differently The final section of the  edition includes just three poems La mort des amants La mort des pauvres and La mort des artistes The Death of Lovers The Death of the Poor The Death of Artists  whereas the  edition includes these three but adds La fin de la journee Le reve d un curieux and Le voyage The End of the Day The Dream of a Curious Man and The voyage  thus significantly altering our perception of the end both of Baudelaire s poetic project in Les Fleurs and of the metaphysical implications of death for the subject awaiting it I turn now to a  The Fall Out of Redemption comparison of the final poem of  La mort des artistes and the last poem of the  edition Le voyage claiming that the latter complicates our sense of an ending of Les Fleurs on account of the portrayal of the end in the penultimate poem Le reve d un curieux The  edition ends with the death not of a generalized subject that Hypocrite lecteur mon semblable mon frere Hypocritish reader my fellow my brother evoked from the very start of the collection but of a certain subset of artists Il en est qui jamais n ont connu leur Idole Et ces sculpteurs damnes et marques d un affront Qui vont se martelant la poitrine et le front N ont qu un espoir etrange et sombre Capitole C est que la Mort planant comme un soleil nouveau Fera s epanouir les fleurs de leur cerveau   There are some who have never known their Idol And those sculptors damned and branded with shame Who are always hammering their brows and their breasts Have but one hope bizarre and somber Capitol It is that Death soaring like a new sun Will bring to bloom the flowers of their brains  Death is figured here as a source of comfort as it had been in more explicit terms in the preceding sonnet La mort des pauvres where death is viewed as consoler and as le seul espoir the only hope of the poor That comfort and the resulting hope are presented in rather different terms in La Mort des artistes since it is far from assured that death will bring to bloom the flowers of their brains and thus we are left with what is probably a vain hope a hope that is nothing like its theological counterpart which aligns with trust but is rather more like wishing Claude Pichois notes the parallel between this vision and the more explicitly violent one in the prose poem Le Confiteor de l artiste The Artist s Confiteor whose conclusion asserts that L etude du beau est un duel ou l artiste crie de frayeur avant d etre vaincu Studying the beautiful is a duel in which the arist shrieks with fright before being defeated     The artists of La Mort des artistes are no longer active creators consciously manipulating their destiny in an act that parallels divine creation but are rather reduced to a state similar to that of the helpless poor without even the reassuring potential of the portique ouvert sur les Cieux inconnus the portal opening on unknown Skies    with which La Mort des pauvres comes to its end Death for these artists is merely an endpoint that defines the failure of their life s project Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  The  edition by contrast features a far more universalizing vision of the end both of the poetry collection and of the human subject The long poem Le voyage which closes the definitive edition of Les Fleurs engages a collective nous we from the very start of the poem an inclusive gesture that goes far beyond the particular populations of lovers the poor and artists represented in the original three poems that comprised the section La Mort With this poem Baudelaire returns to the more expansive metaphysical vision with which he began the collection in Au lecteur a poem that seeks to reduce rather than reinforce the division between the author and the reader and among readers themselves While the nous is sometimes presumably universal and sometimes restricted to the group of travelers who speak in the poem  the final section puts the nous in a particular situation of expectant longing o Mort vieux capitaine il est temps levons l ancre Ce pays nous ennuie o Mort Appareillons Si le ciel et la mer sont noirs comme de l encre Nos coeurs que tu connais sont remplis de rayons Versenous ton poison pour qu il nous reconforte Nous voulons tant ce feu nous brule le cerveau Plonger au fond du gouffre Enfer ou Ciel qu importe Au fond de l Inconnu pour trouver du nouveau   O Death old captain it is time let s weigh anchor This country wearies us O Death Let us set sail Though the sea and the sky are black as ink Our hearts which you know well are filled with rays of light Pour out your poison that it may refresh us This fire burns our brains so fiercely we wish to plunge To the abyss depths Heaven or Hel  does it matter To the depths of the Unknown to find something new  At first glance this final section of the poem represents quite a different look at death than the one we see in the other poems of the section Rather than a mere consolation Death here is the vehicle of adventure the motor of a continuing existence that looks beyond the end of the poem toward an open set of possibilities replacing the vain hope of La Mort des artistes with the thrill of the new and unknown On this reading even the notion of the gouffre would in a sense be redeemed because the abyss would now be the space where the new could be found and subject removed from the torturous stasis of Ennui and transported toward something currently undefined but presumably desirable  The Fall Out of Redemption Reading this poem in the context of another that Baudelaire added to the  edition of this section of Les Fleurs throws a redemptive interpretation of the conclusion of Le voyage into question The penultimate poem of the  edition is Le reve d un curieux Connaistu comme moi la douleur savoureuse Et de toi faistu dire Oh l homme singulier J al ais mourir C etait dans mon ame amoureuse Desir mele d horreur un mal particulier Angoisse et vif espoir sans humeur factieuse Plus al ait se vidant le fatal sablier Plus ma torture etait apre et delicieuse Tout mon coeur s arrachait au monde familier J etais comme l enfant avide du spectacle Haissant le rideau comme on hait un obstacle Enfin la verite froide se revela J etais mort sans surprise et la terrible aurore M enveloppait Eh quoi n estce donc que cela La toile etait levee et j attendais encore    Do you know as I do delectable suffering And do you have them say of you O the strange man I was going to die In my soul full of love A peculiar illness desire mixed with horror Anguish and bright hopes without internal strife The more the fatal hourglass continued to flow The fiercer and more delightful grew my torture My heart was being torn from this familiar world I was like a child eager for the play Hating the curtain as one hates an obstacle Final y the cold truth revealed itself I had died and was not surprised the awful dawn Enveloped me What is that all there is to it The curtain had risen and I was still waiting  Under the apparently simple guise of an anecdote this poem complicates the notion of subjectivity and the sense of an ending to a greater extent than we have seen in the conclusion of Le voyage The setting of the poem as dream made explicit by Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  the title but never referred to in the poem itself allows the poet to speak as a kind of disembodied detemporalized subjectivity looking back on his own experience and narrating it from the point of view of the end Yet the end is of course not definitive since the subject is still present and able to double back on itself thus putting us in something like the temporality of L heautontimoroumenos which drives toward an end and desires the end to come all the while preventing its coming by the continuation of discourse There is a further resemblance between the two poems in the opening out onto an eternal temporality the eternal laughter of the former and the indefinite I was still waiting of this poem  which ends by not ending coming to rest in a point of unrest that prolongs the messianic moment in Agamben s sense of the time that time takes to come to an end without providing the means for arriving at the end In other words the poem not only defers the arrival of redemption but renders it impossible precisely because of the infinite prolongation of this temporal moment which nonetheless does not allow us to cancel temporality The poem interrupts itself several times with the dashes that announce those interruptions coming at moments that do not correspond to the sonnet s divisions into quatrains and tercets The typical poetic structure of the sonnet is thus both posited and questioned here as is the notion of the end The poem s first two lines stand alone as a direct address to the reader without apparent relationship to the anecdote that follows The Reve in question thus only begins in earnest in line three of the poem once the opening question has come to an end The poem itself ends twice the first time prematurely in the middle of line  following an enjambment which we recall is for Agamben the defining feature of a poem Furthermore the tone itself changes after the dash highlighting the double ending of the poem by a lapse into highly prosaic language and syntax It is unclear whether the question and comment that end the poem are a continuation of the dream or the poet s commentary about the dream after the fact Either way the poem resists coming to a definitive end or rather the definitive end of the poem is simultaneously an infinitely extended waiting as it was at the end of L irreparable as well where the poet writes that his heart is un theatre ou l on attend Toujours toujours en vain Is a playhouse where one awaits Always always in vain     Le reve d un curieux introduces disappointment as the inevitable reaction to death an indication that so long as subjectivity persists it will not be able to find consolation in death which turns out in this poem to be for the subject able to perceive it just as ineffectual a solution to the problem of Ennui as satanic revolt had been As it is framed in Le Reve d un curieux the problem is one of knowledge which is in play from the very first word of the poem Connaistu comme moi la douleur savoureuse On one hand this is another device to reduce the distance between the poet and the hypocrite lecteur and to indicate the potential y perverse desire for death But what is unusual about desire in this poem is that it is fulfilled and the knowledge about desire about which the poet inquires at the outset becomes knowledge about death and consequently about the inevitable disappointment of a phenomenon that does not live up to our expectations The hopeful expectation  The Fall Out of Redemption even if it is figured as torture is canceled by the disappointment that knowledge brings with it If we agree with Benjamin Fondane that knowledge rather than disobedience is in fact the source of original sin and that we are unable to cancel its effects without canceling our very humanity then this poem too brings us back to the primacy of the theological domain in Baudelaire The greater the effort to extract himself from the familiar world the more unseverable his bond to it grows The theme of knowledge also figures in the penultimate section of Le voyage which begins with the exclamation Amer savoir celui qu on tire du voyage Bitter is the knowledge one gains from voyaging     The poet hardly provides a ringing endorsement of travel Si tu peux rester reste Pars s il le faut If you can stay remain Leave if you must     While there are indications that it is Ennui that makes us restless and converts every new discovery into a new source of anguish the condition of knowledge is prior to the condition of Ennui and could said to be generative of it constantly returning us to the disappointment that knowledge inevitably brings with it Given the irredeemable image of the poet child eternal y waiting before the already revealed spectacle we need to question any interpretation of the last section of Le voyage the last words of Les Fleurs du Mal themselves that sees in it a hopeful tone I would like to propose in light of Agamben s remarks on the way poems both strive toward and resist their endings and in light of the notion of the eternal fal that we have seen operating in several of Baudelaire s poems that Les Fleurs du Mal ends twice the first time in Le reve d un curieux and again in Le voyage This reading sees in the latter poem an enactment of the fall into fruitless expectation that the former poem had already dismantled as a possibility The poetic subject cannot come to an end in Le reve d un curieux lost as he is in eternal waiting or if we imagine the subject recounting his dream suspended in the present moment of that narration of the dream Either way the subject does not cannot die and even if it were to die it would not reap the benefits of that death in terms of the cancel ation of the suffering brought about by knowledge since the perceiving subject would then cease to exist and thus to perceive We can only imagine what it would be like to be free of the torment of existence but that imagination is made all the more disturbing by the knowledge of the impossibility of bringing about that freedom from torment Thus the imagination of a better circumstance becomes a temptation and once again we remain in the realm of the unredeemable If Le reve d un curieux presents an accurate summation of Baudelaire s conception of knowledge and eternal irreparation a view confirmed by the identification of the amer savoir in Le voyage then the final section of the latter poem in its eager call for death to lead the subject on to its next adventure in novelty needs to be read as another deluded cry from a subject unaware that death as an experience will not bring any redemptive experience of the new The speaking subject here is akin to the one in the first part of Le reve d un curieux naive in his anxious expectation unaware that disappointment inevitably awaits The final lines of Les Fleurs du Mal leave us in breathless expectation of the new with an implied hint of the possibility of redemption to be found there but the infinite Coming to an End Agamben and Baudelaire  expansion of that ending has already been cancelled in advance by the ending of Le reve d un curieux hence the double ending of Les Fleurs du Mal Le reve d un curieux is a more definitive ending by virtue of the way it shuts down the possibility of hope for escape by reinforcing the quasitheological underpinning of the necessary suffering because of knowledge of the perceiving subject Yet by the openness of the ending as well as the fact that it is the penultimate and not the final poem of the collection it is clearly not completely definitive as an ending Le voyage on this reading presents us in the final section with yet another example of a desiring subject oblivious to the fact that death like satanic revolt intoxication or any number of potential solutions will not bring about the desired relief from suffering In that sense it is an ending that both closes the collection and sends us back to Le reve d un curieux and its refusal of the kind of open launch into the nouveau that Le voyage offers Thus the last poem of the collection is not definitive as an ending futhermore it also forces a forgetting of the penultimate poem in order to seem viable as an approach both to death and to the conclusion of the collection The poetic effect of the juxtaposition of the endings of the final two poems of Les Fleurs du Mal is thus quite striking the collection itself both strives for and resists its own end by setting up a structure whereby the final two poems turn back in on themselves as the end of the penultimate poem leads us on to Le voyage only to have the end of that poem lead us inevitably back to the frustrated sense of an ending implied by the disappointed spectator awaiting something beyond the end The conclusion of Les Fleurs du Mal thus performs the link between poetic closure and the problem of ironic subjectivity as constructed in poems such as L heautontimoroumenos which can conclude only by spiraling into the eternity of satanic laughter The definitive end here as in the concluding poems of the collection could only come with the extinguishing of subjectivity in the neant a definitive closure that is refused at the same time as definitive poetic closure The refusal of the possibility of redemption has implications not only for the impossible death of the subject but also for the structure of poetry itself which is denied the definitive ending toward which it strives The prototheological considerations we have seen operating throughout Baudelaire s thought and poetry thus turn out to be inseparable from formal considerations of poetic structure in ways consonant with Agamben s theorizing of the end of the poem and its relation to the end of time and the end of poetry more largely The ending of the  edition is thus far more faithful to the nonmessianic vision of Baudelaire s poetry articulated even in the  edition whose ending it turns out is also a penultimate end when we see it in the light of the  revision The poetry thus itself mirrors or prefigures its own reception in that it has proven especial y resistant to attempts to identify definitive meaning that resistance to immediate or transparent meaning is often evoked as one of the aspects of Baudelaire s modernity But here the fragility of terms such as modernity and antimodernity comes to the fore since it is precisely the poetry s refusal of linear progression its infinite doubling back that subtracts it from the linear logic of the modern while making the problem of endings central to its esthetic and metaphysical concerns  The Order of Impossible Salvation From Baudelaire to Cioran Baudelaire s working through of the consequences of his asoteriology has resonance far beyond his own time period A host of thinkers have revisited the kinds of metaphysical and esthetic questions we have been raising in light of the ever more explicit declaration of God s death in the nineteenth century and in the attempt to grapple further with the implications of the impossibility of redemption For as in the case of the concept of the death of God itself it is not and cannot be simply a question of abandoning soteriological logic altogether as if we could leave behind that pattern of thought once and for al  with no remainder and adopt another one An important inheritor of Baudelaire s asoteriological thinking and writing one who like him retains elements of a Christian framework but abandons both the crucial matter of belief and the central doctrine of redemption is Emil Cioran Like Baudelaire Cioran s writings take up both the philosophical and esthetic implications of what turns out in Cioran s case to be a most difficult struggle to abandon what he knows to be an impossible logic of redemption In Cioran we see Baudelaire s project reconceived in light of the cultural intellectual and esthetic developments of the early and mid twentieth century By virtue of his intertwining of these philosophical and esthetic concerns around the transformed discourse of Christianity Cioran can be considered Baudelaire s heir although he does not explicitly position himself that way Like the nineteenth century poet the twentiethcentury aphorist renders explicit the struggle to resolve the question of the full implications of the impossibility of redemption rather than just attempting to pass over the difficulty inherent in overcoming that mode of thinking At stake of course is the set of concerns that is sometimes referred to as nihilism the complex issue of revaluing values of attempting to salvage strands of a redemptive logic where one no longer exists The history of philosophical engagement with that question is inextricably bound up with esthetic engagement and the mid to late twentieth century that is the moment that is foundational for thinkers of Cioran s generation saw an intensification of the discourse that one might label nihilism and a renewed skepticism about the ability of art to cancel its effects or to redeem meaningless or catastrophic experience Simon Critchley traces back to Kant the attributing of such powers to the esthetic The category of the esthetic is the place  The Fall Out of Redemption where the problem of nihilism the dilemma as to what might count as a meaningful life without the founding certainties of religion is broached Very Little   He goes on to inquire following Kierkegaard as to whether the esthetic can perform the lofty function formerly undertaken by religion   A central preoccupation of Cioran s is lucidity and thus in his reflections on art and writing he will seek to articulate a vision of esthetics that resists il usion Key among these il usions is the implicit or explicit assumption that art carries in the wake of the eclipse of the Christian soteriological vision some redemptive value and so Cioran will throughout his writings attempt to articulate the place of art in a world that he wishes to see freed from the il usion of a falsely comforting or redemptive vision Cioran s implicit interlocutor in this articulation of the role of the esthetic is Friedrich Nietzsche and so a brief consideration of the question of art and redemption in Nietzsche is in order all the more so since the German philosopher by his vehement critique of Christianity and his desire to draw the sometimes disturbing consequences of the death of God that he announces could be seen as the prototypical representative of the view that seeks to place art in the salvific role once held by the Christian religion Shane Weller takes up the question of art and transfiguration in Nietzsche If Christianity as the moral interpretation of the world is a craving for the nothing or a No to life then the aesthetic interpretation must be an affirmation of that same life The life Leben that is to be affirmed however is itself nothing other than art as is made clear when Nietzsche asserts that all of life is based on semblance Schein  art deception points of view and the necessity of perspectives and error BoT   Thus if art is a supplement to natural reality as an affirmation of life it is in fact an affirmation of itself It is not simply that life overcomes itself as art then but rather that art overcomes itself as art What art transfigures is nothing other than itself Weller  Already it is possible to see the logic of redemption in the idea of affirming life as art The notion of transfiguration places us within the realm where the theological and esthetic meet and the selfovercoming carries more than an echo of resurrection recast in esthetic terms To affirm life as art is to redeem what is not affirmable presumably il usion by the transvaluation of il usion now recast entirely in the domain of art By an act that looks something like redemptive grace the unaffirmable aspect of life is canceled in its rebirth as art If what Nietzsche affirms and redeems as life is in fact art we return here to Agamben s notion of redemption that is ultimately empty because it saves only itself thus becoming a contentless redemption in light of the fact that pace Nietzsche creation must fade away redemption s exigency is lost in the unsavable Born from a creation that is left pending it ends up as an inscrutable salvation that no longer has an objective Nudities   Weller s analysis goes on to show that it would seem that nihilism as Nietzsche determines it is ultimately impossible given that the archnihilist is in fact already The Order of Impossible Salvation  a yescreating force   but still the transfiguration that is the selfovercoming of art cannot be a purely affirmative act since the artist is characterized by negation and more precisely by a negation in the form of a selftransfiguration which is always also a mode of veiling   Several key concepts that Cioran takes up in his cumulative writings on esthetics lucidity and redemption are present in this reading of Nietzsche Of particular importance is the notion of veiling which stands opposed to the disclosive function of art and places the artist as well as the human subject more general y given the way that art encroaches on and becomes synonymous in a sense with life back into the realm of il usion This view works against an affirmation of art s ability to provide lucid insight If art through its self transfiguration returns to the realm of il usion it cannot real y have any redemptive value because it ironical y affirms itself as il usory in a way that blocks our ability to transcend that il usion Coming to rest in itself art can thus save only itself and is reduced to the same impotence as redemption forced to turn in on itself in a salvific gesture that we must label meaningless We shall see in this chapter and the next that Cioran may sometimes affirm the redemptive characteristics of art but only as a temporary redemption one that is subject to its own selfnegation and in that sense there is nothing more redemptive in art than there would be in say Baudelaire s state of intoxication which while it provides temporary and il usory respite from a lucid vision of the world we would be tempted to label redemptive As for Nietzsche his version of redemption through art is not so much temporary as constant He writes in The Birth of Tragedy The more aware I become of those omnipotent art impulses in nature and find in them an ardent longing for il usion and for redemption by il usion the more I feel compelled to make the metaphysical assumption that the truly existent the primal Oneness eternal y suffering and contradictory also needs the delightful vision the pleasurable il usion for its constant redemption an il usion that we utterly caught up in it and consisting of it are required to see as empirical reality If we look away from our own reality then for a moment if we see our empirical existence like that of the world in general as an idea of the primal Oneness created in a moment then we must see the dream as the il usion of il usion and hence as an even higher satisfaction of the original desire for il usion Birth  It is not surprising that Nietzsche goes on to engage a painting of a Christian scene Raphael s Transfiguration as an allegorical il ustration of the kind of transformation he describes here for it is clear that Nietzsche s description of the redemptive function of art depends heavily on Christian notions of redemption which Nietzsche applies to esthetic experience without fundamental y altering the logic of redemption on which both Christian and Nietzschean transfiguration depend While Nietzsche arguably offers a secularized esthetic redemption the certainty that underlies his claims about access to a higher reality the il usion of il usion gives the lie to its purported removal from Christian patterns of thought The unity effected by esthetic vision here is even a comforting vision one that satisfies desire in a way that brings the tension of  The Fall Out of Redemption unsatisfied desire to rest in the supposedly eternal presence of the desire il usion The world thus imagined is caught in a structure of mutual interdependence that cancels the content of the il usion in favor of the structure or form of the il usion and thus creates a selfperpetuating world eternal and complete unto itself that parallels messianic time by its removal from dynamic movement The celestial vision is precisely what is revealed in the transfiguration and so once again Nietzsche s secular esthetics remains uncomfortably but necessarily tied to the logic of redemption from which presumably he would like to escape From this il usion there now arises like an ambrosial vapour a new and visionary world of il usion of which those caught up in the first il usion see nothing a radiant gloating in the purest bliss and painless contemplation beaming from wideopen eyes Here in the highest artistic symbolism we behold that Apolline world of beauty and its substratum the terrible wisdom of Silenus and we intuitively understand their reciprocal necessity With sublime gestures Apollo reveals to us how the whole world of torment is necessary so that the individual can create the redeeming vision and then immersed in contemplation of it sit peaceful y in his tossing boat amid the waves Birth   Such a rendering of art s transfiguration of empirical reality satisfyingly accounts for the simultaneity of the visions but not for their reciprocal necessity Nietzsche s vision here reads more like an esthetic theodicy attempting to account for evil but claiming that it is necessary for it to exist in order for us to be free of it which seems to beg the question We have already seen that early twentiethcentury engagement with similar questions will come to rather different conclusions hearkening back to Baudelaire in order to alter the function of contemplation For Nietzsche contemplation equals serenity and is a byproduct of the reciprocal mutual dependence of reality and its esthetical y transfigured other face But as we have seen in the network of ideas that circulate among Benjamin Fondane and Baudelaire contemplation aligns itself with an unredeemable vision inspired by evil stemming from a view of knowledge that sees it as knowledge of evil only If there is no transfigured reality there can be no redemption and so the theological y inflected vocabulary of Baudelaire and his later interpreters gets us paradoxical y further from the logic of redemption than Nietzsche s brand of estheticism which for all its adoption of pagan deities clings strongly to the logic of redemption in ways that Baudelairean atheology is compelled to refuse While the subject under Baudelairean original sin may be incurvatus in se turned in on itself the Nietzschean vision makes no room for such an individual subject creating instead an entire esthetic world that is closed in upon itself in its mutual y selfcompleting and redemptive movement from il usion to the il usion of il usion This subjectless world is what leads toward what Agamben has identified as the redemption that becomes pure subject for itself We have seen Agamben s atheological analysis of this structural move he writes analogously in The Man without Content about art s own The Order of Impossible Salvation  similar move akin to Nietzsche s selfenclosed esthetic world toward an art of pure form that results ultimately not in Nietzschean harmony but in nihilism Art is the annihilating entity that traverses all its contents without ever being able to attain a positive work because it cannot identify with any content And since art has become the pure potentiality of negation nihilism reigns in its essence The essence of nihilism coincides with the essence of art as the extreme point of its destiny insofar as in both being destines itself to man in the form of Nothingness Man    The esthetic nothingness of pure form is however even if it were achievable incompatible with the nothingness that plays such a crucial role as we have seen in Baudelaire s esthetics and metaphysics of nonredemption In this instance it is Baudelaire rather than Nietzsche who inaugurates an esthetic and critical heritage that seeks to come to terms with the elimination of redemption as a mode of thought rather than simple reversing or secularizing the way in which redemption is achieved Subjectivity persists in Baudelaire s poetry which opposes itself on these grounds to the Nietzschean view as he articulates it here As an inheritor of both traditions in the twentieth century Emil Cioran enters into dialogue with both but ultimately must be seen to side with Baudelaire when it comes to the impossibility of an extended redemptive esthetic vision Sylvain David is right to note that Cioran follows Nietzsche in the latter s attempt at pil aging the word is Cioran s poetry s material in order to give back a little vigor to philosophy It is a question of opposing the semantic freedom of verse to the logical rigor of the sentence  By breathing a dose of lyricism into the exercise of thought the essayist attempts a redemptive transmutation that seeks to replace the frozen concept with the vivacity of the image to triumph over the spirit of the system and the false objectivity that it implies by a return to the vigor of the passions David  Cioran s philosophical project borrows its style and something of its form then from Nietzsche Paradoxical y though the return to the poetic turns him away from Nietzschean esthetic redemption and toward Baudelaire the latter s poetry by its relentless insistence on the poetic subject unable to engage in selfcancel ation opposes itself in terms of content to Nietzsche s vision Nietzsche s view must be dismissed on the same grounds as traditional Christianity is dismissed as an overly and unjustifiably optimistic vision of a redemption that is in fact impossible Cioran himself says as much A un etudiant qui voulait savoir ou j en etais par rapport a Nietzsche  je repondis que j avais cesse de le pratiquer depuis longtemps Pourquoi me demandatil Parce que je le trouve trop naif  The Fall Out of Redemption Je lui reproche ses emballements et jusqu a ses ferveurs Il n a demoli des idoles que pour les remplacer par d autres Il n a observe les hommes que de loin Les auraitil regardes de pres jamais il n eut pu concevoir ni proner sur le surhomme vision farfelue risible sinon grotesque Pl  To a student who wanted to know where I stood regarding Nietzsche  I replied that I had stopped engaging with him a long time ago Why he asked Because I find him too naive I reproach him for his flights of enthusiasm and even his fervors He demolished idols only to replace them with other ones He observed men only from afar If he had looked at them from up close he could never have conceived or extol the overman farfetched vision laughable if not grotesque This is not to say that by rejecting Nietzsche as overly optimistic Cioran s writings provoke a gloomy despair Rather as Michel Jarrety has argued for Cioran only the happiness of negating allows us to tolerate the real as it actual y is Jarrety   He thus substitutes a model of tolerance for Nietzsche s notion of transfiguration resulting in what Jarrety labels a double negation the one that contests the world God progress in history etc by the refusal to recognize in them a full reality and at the same time the one that triumphs over itself by this second thrust that constitutes the joy of denouncing the absence or precariousness of it to hold the world in derision is to put it at a distance Jarrety  What emerges is something like a therapeutic model which places Cioran closer to the Stoics than to any more modern precursors From the start of his appearance on the French literary scene it became apparent that Cioran was not easily classifiable in terms of literary or esthetic precedents and that like Baudelaire he undoubtedly announced something new while retaining a forceful vocabulary from several traditions that had gone before Cioran s literary debut in French was the  publication of Precis de decomposition A Short History of Decay  famously hailed by Max Nadeau in terms that point to the distinctness of Cioran s literary voice while at the same time claiming that voice as somehow representative of a postWorld War II culture seeking an expression appropriate to the radical historical and culture rupture of that event In his article Un penseur crepusculaire A Twilight Thinker  Nadeau writes The one we were waiting for has come the prophet of concentrational era and of collective suicide the one whose arrival was prepared by the philosophers of nothingness and the absurd the bringer of bad news par excel ence Nadeau   The choice of the term prophet is revealing here since it situates Cioran s vision like those of the prophets as both idiosyncratic and prescient of the kind of vision that will become common rather than unusual in the future Nadeau also complicates the reference to prophecy by placing Cioran at the end as well as at the beginning of an intellectual geneaological line since he situates the existentialists as precursors of Cioran The logic of the contradiction or of the both and dominates all of Cioran s thought and writing and so it is fitting The Order of Impossible Salvation  that his arrival on the French literary scene is noted under the complex sign of the prophet in his ability both to typify contemporary experience and to render it in a form we find disturbingly or unsettlingly new Nadeau goes on perceptively to identify another productive tension one that will animate all of Cioran s work between the embodied particular voice of a suffering subject and a more abstract generalized disembodied voice It is not a monster nor a phenomenon barely an agitator but it is surely a being submerged in shame and disgust and who suffers On the shore of the triumphal way that leads to atomic destruction he puts down his sack and sits down exhausted refusing all consolations and all pity   And significantly Nadeau raises the question of belief He still believes in something since he writes confesses and sings his distress   Already it is clear that Cioran s nihilism is not a simple or simplistic one but Nadeau s observation opens up several difficult questions lurking beneath the seemingly straightforward assertion that he makes If Cioran does not simply negate everything what is in fact left Nadeau links belief here to the act of writing Cioran believes since he writes What kind of belief would be indicated by the act of writing exactly A belief in writing itself In its worth In its potential not just to record but to transform experience And what exactly does it mean to believe in this context As with Baudelaire it can be difficult to write about Cioran because of his dedication to contradiction and to doubleness His aphorisms lend themselves easily to quotation but getting a grasp on his work as a whole is a more challenging enterprise  While he actively resists a systematic approach there are several themes that recur regularly throughout his work Positing a global rather than a local interpretation of them however risks mischaracterizing his work as a whole as Patrice Bollon has noted One would have to cite all of Cioran in order to account for this unclassifiable and properly untenable position that affirms in the same move when it is not within a single sentence the demand for the most il uminating lucidity and the necessity of the most obscurantist il usion the search for wisdom and acquiescence to the most vile drives a mystical drawing toward saintliness and attachment to the most atheistic materialism incredulousness concerning change and a fortiori progress and the romantic ineluctability of revolt As if in him coexisted permanently and about all subjects the affirmer and the negator the ideologue and one who contests him the pleader and the judge in an eternal contradictory soliloquy an infinite dialogue with self between the divided parts of his personality Bollon  The philosophical the theological and the esthetic are already complexly intertwined in Nadeau s simple observation about Cioran and as his own writing develops over the ten books that will follow the Precis Cioran returns constantly to the kinds of questions we have already been raising One of his several obsessional themes is redemption At the most basic level we could simply assert that Cioran  The Fall Out of Redemption finds salvation impossible and untenable and indeed I will show below how this follows from several of his most important postulations  But as with Baudelaire such a simple observation raises more issues than it resolves because as was also the case with Baudelaire and the other authors we have examined enumerating the consequences of the impossibility of redemption is anything but straightforward and draws us right back to the philosophicoesthetic web of questions we have just begun to pursue Beyond that we also need to contend with the fact that much more so than in Baudelaire the notion of redemption constantly reappears throughout Cioran s works despite its impossibility as a working hypothesis which demonstrates the incredible difficulty of the task of thinking beyond redemption even if we were to want or indeed need to Redemption reappears in several guises and as a result of a variety of kinds of experience none of which relate back to a Christian redemptive sacrifice  but none of these appearances cancels the impossibility of redemption which governs Cioran s thought thus making it necessary for Cioran s reader to account for redemption s simultaneous presence in the writing and impossibility as an active and viable concept From the outset we should be clear that Cioran does not operate within a paradigm of belief in God a fact easily obscured by the constant reference to God the devil and other borrowings from the lexicon of Christianity Even more so than Baudelaire had done Cioran separates the use of the Christian framework from the question of belief and is more explicit about the refusal of that belief than Baudelaire had been In interviews for instance he affirms directly Je ne crois ni en Dieu ni en rien I believe neither in God nor in anything E  and cal s himself a theologien athee atheist theologian E   This is not to say however that Cioran s writings may be justifiably or helpful y labeled atheistic Even though he indicates that his attitude est celle d un theologien non croyant attitude is that of a nonbelieving theologian E   it would be overly simplistic and ultimately misleading to call Cioran a partisan of an atheistic theology It is in fact significant that even in the phrase just quoted he claims that his attitude is that of such a theologian not that he is one himself In other words there is an attitude that informs his writing but the writing itself is not and could not be the work of a theologian since that would invest more force in the unbelief than Cioran is ever willing to concede As in Baudelaire Christian concepts devoid of their central tenet of redemption have a force much greater than a metaphor they are retained and refuted simultaneously in ways that no convenient label can capture Thus one of the greatest understatements from Cioran not usual y known for reducing the force of his assertions lurks in this claim Je ne suis pas croyant mais la religion m interesse I am not a believer but religion interests me E    The precise nature and extent of that interest in religion can emerge only through a prolonged engagement with the multifaceted ways Cioran uses these terms and concepts throughout his writings as concentrating on any one particular use at any given moment gives a misleading picture of the whole As was the case with Baudelaire this is not to say that a coherent whole eventual y emerges The theological for both of them functions as something more like a fiction but to assert that it is necessary to understand the full force and uncommon meaning that they give to the notion of fiction as wel  The Order of Impossible Salvation  It would be premature however to propose such an answer even as a tentative hypothesis this is so because by explicitly rejecting systematic philosophy Cioran forces us to read him in a way different than searching for the identification of a problem and its subsequent solution The serious attention paid to style noted by every commentator on Cioran and the frequent choice of aphorism or very short essay as a form suggest that there is insight into Cioran s process of thinking to be gained from approaches that pursue alternatives to linearity and systematicity Of all of the antinomies operating in Cioran s process and works Sylvain David identifies one that is primary in that it forms the fundamental pair of moves between which Cioran vacil ates In a general way the aporias at the heart of Cioran s work can be reduced to a dichotomy between an attraction for the venomous charm of negative exercises and a paradoxical but nevertheless present temptation to exist Beyond doubt a wil  or even a need to believe remains From this irreducible interior quartering Cioran draws his great watchword that of thinking against oneself This exercise of dangerous intellectuality seems to correspond to certain esthetic practices of modernity as the references to those three masters who remain with the author Nietzsche Dostoyevski and Baudelaire testify I am the wound and the knife there is our absolute our eternity TE   David  Thinking against oneself the subtitle of a section of the Precis de decomposition but also a more than adequate brief charaterization of all of Cioran s enterprise is like all of the terms we have considered so far plural in its meanings but all of the possible meanings of the term return to the selftorture of the divided subject which David rightly links to Baudelaire Not simply a romantic subject attracted at some level to intellectual masochism Cioran s writing subject emerges in part out of the intellectual history it often stubbornly refuses to evoke explicitly but with which it engages by its impression of coming after everything and attempting to think from the ruins of a long tradition or rather to return to a tradition seen in a new light to ask what might still be either available or adaptable But lest that description imply confidence on the part of Cioran s speaking subject we need to remember that thinking against oneself also implies constant doubt another key leitmotif in Cioran s work Doubt in turn contains its own division against itself since to think against doubt would mean temporarily to affirm certainty Such emphasis on aporia and paradiox may seem like the stuff of intellectual games but the stakes are always high in Cioran and tragedy is a much more apt comparison than the ludic enterprise even if an ironic sense of humor often shines through Cioran s vituperation Cioran provides the most sustained discussion of redemption in two of his three works that consist of extended essays rather than shorter fragments La chute dans le temps and Le mauvais demiurge both from his middle period but before turning to those works it is important to spend some time with the Precis since it announces so much of the thematic materials that Cioran would develop over the next forty years and also allows us to get a fuller grasp on how he appropriates and transforms  The Fall Out of Redemption Christian concepts At times in the Precis he adapts a specifical y monastic Christianity generalizing the medieval concept of acedia far beyond the cloister Acedia Cette stagnation des organes cette hebetude des facultes ce sourire petrifie ne te rappellentils pas souvent l ennui des cloitres les coeurs deserts de Dieu la secheresse et l idiotie des moines s execrant dans l emportement extatique de la masturbation La terre le ciel sont les parois de ta cel ule et dans l air qu aucun souffle n agite seule regne l absence d oraison Promis aux heures creuses de l eternite a la peripherie des frissons et aux desirs moisis qui pourrissent a l approche du salut tu t ebranles vers un jugement sans faste et sans trompettes cependant que tes pensees pour toute solennite n ont imagine que la procession irreelle des esperances Et tu retombes dans le monde comme une Trappe sans foi trainant sur le boulevard Ordre des filles perdues et de ta perdition Pl  Acedia That stagnation of the organs that stupor of the faculties that petrified smile do they not remind you often of the ennui of cloisters hearts that God has deserted dryness and idiocy of the monks hating themselves in the ecstatic transport of masturbation The earth and the sky are the wal s of your cel  and in the air that no breath agitates only the absence of prayer reigns Promised to the empty hours of eternity to the periphery of shudders and the moldy desires that rot at the approach of salvation you set off toward a judgment without splendor and without trumpets whereas your thoughts for all solemnity imagine only the unreal procession of hopes And you fall back into the world like a Trappist without faith dragging along the boulevard the Order of Lost Girls and of your perdition The passage makes clear that Cioran forces a new antilinear approach to time much in line with his rethinking of time in the later works we will explore below when we wish to trace the intellectual or cultural genealogy of the concepts he evokes While undoubtedly contemporary in the refusal of religious faith and indeed in the approach consisting of piecing together fragments of earlier cultural attitudes in order to form a new one from the ghosts or traces of the old this excerpt establishes just as much continuity as rupture with the Middle Ages expanding the purview of acedia and thereby making contemporary society resemble its medieval counterpart if we are able to subtract the question of religious faith and salvation from the equation Cioran returns to a monastic framework later in the Precis A nous autres il nous faudrait des cloitres aussi depossedes aussi vides que nos ames pour nous y perdre sans l assistance des cieux et dans une purete d ideal absent des cloitres a la mesure d anges detrompes qui dans leur chute a force d il usions vaincues demeureraient encore immacules Et d esperer une vogue The Order of Impossible Salvation  de retraites dans une eternite sans foi une prise d habit dans le neant un Ordre affranchi des mysteres et dont nul frere ne se reclamerait de rien dedaignant son salut comme celui des autres un Ordre de l impossible salut Pl  We others would need cloisters as dispossessed as empty as our souls to lose ourselves there without the assistance of the heavens and in the purity of an absent ideal cloisters on the scale of demystified angels who in their fal  by dint of vanquished il usions still remained immaculate And to hope for a vogue of retreats in an eternity without faith a taking of the monastic habit in nothingness an Order empancipated from mysteries and of which no brother would ask anything disdaining his salvation and that of others an Order of Impossible Salvation Here the focus is sharper than in the earlier reference to an imaginary Order of Lost Girls in this reformulation of the monastic framework Cioran lays out the terrain on which he will operate over the course of the next several decades The new monks are now explicitly linked to a fal  but not one that would simply result in a valorization of Satanism Rather the fall purifies in some sense and is the condition of possibility of the emergence of the new monasticism This new order which one could only halfappropriately call postChristian represents the end product of the process by which what is salvageable from older redemptive models of thought is retained while the soteriology itself is removed Neither the original monasticism nor a parody of it nor its elimination the Order of Impossible Salvation is the new conceptual model necessarily imaginary but powerful as a base from which an asoteriological thinking might emerge Such thinking the passage implies would involve fidelity to practice but not on account of an act of faith it would be based on lucidity but not a lucidity that cancels all action And above al  the monastic model implies fidelity to its founding notion a commitment to live out the consequences of the Impossible Salvation which it adopts as its founding principle Here Cioran appears to subtract redemption effortlessly from the model of faithful commitment to an intellectual ideal but as we shall see soteriological logic is not often easily surpassed and least so by any simple attempt to negate it without remainder Beyond linking the medieval and the contemporary however Cioran here establishes an important connection to Baudelaire as well via the notion of acedia easily transposed as Cioran here describes it into the register of Baudelairean ennui which owes a debt to romantic despondency but far surpasses it in the troubling generalizing of the sentiment as opposed to its reservation for a select few Thus there are at least three temporalities often opposed to one another by those with an eye to periodization premodern high modern postmodern  superimposed in Cioran s fragment and shown to reveal points of commonality or dialogue that invite us to move beyond a linear temporality when it comes to tracing the history of the ideas at play here The point of my analysis of Cioran is not simply to establish a comparison to Baudelaire but given I argue that they are two crucial figures in the story of the fall out of the logic of redemption and that there are indeed patterns of similarity  The Fall Out of Redemption in their approach to reappropriating deChristianized Christian themes for other purposes it is worth pausing before forging ahead over the links between the two While Cioran does not often make explicit reference to other authors in his own works he pays brief but significant homage to Baudelaire in De l inconvenient d etre ne The Trouble with Being Born Un ecrivain ne nous a pas marques parce que nous l avons beaucoup lu mais parce que nous avons pense a lui plus que de raison Je n ai pratique specialement ni Baudelaire ni Pascal mais je n ai cesse de songer a leurs miseres lesquelles m ont accompagne partout aussi fidelement que les miennes A writer has not made an impression on us because we have read him extensively but because we have thought of him more than is reasonable I have not spent particularly large amounts of time reading Baudelaire or Pascal but I have not ceased dreaming of their miseries which have accompanied me everywhere as faithful y as my own Pl    Other critics have noted points of affinity between Baudelaire and Cioran in certain thematic areas Mariana Sora for instance identifies a Baudelairean trait in Cioran s interest in women saints which features a mix of estheticism and morbid pleasure Sora   and also more significantly in the link between religion and knowledge of evil Sora rightly identifies a distinction between the two regarding the particulars of the relation for Baudelaire it is a question of consciousness of sin whereas for Cioran it is the becoming conscious of an ontic evil   about which we shall have more to say below I have already suggested another important point of continuity between the two writers stemming from the central role of the heautontimoroumenos the self torturer the product of a fragmented subjectivity caught in a suspension of time that produces torment for the divided self who perceives himself as divided Baudelaire s figure of the selftorturer in the poem of that name finds its echo in the constant skepticism and doubt of Cioran s writing voice unable to root himself in any particular position save for the paradoxical and impossible certainty about the appropriateness of doubt as an unquestionable position and thus condemned to think against himself This selftormenting position is one that Sylvain David has labeled Cioran s negative heroism David    Both Baudelaire and Cioran make this figure foundational to their ontology and metaphysics While neither of them dwel s at disproportionately great length on the idea it necessarily colors virtual y all of their other inquiries and leads both of them to prefer the void of nonexistence to the torture of existence Like Baudelaire Cioran publishes a prayer to a God he hardly believes in whereas Baudelaire had asked God to grant that he may not be inferior to those he despises Cioran uses prayer as a means toward being free of prayer itself Seigneur donnezmoi la faculte de ne jamais prier epargnezmoi l insanite de toute adoration eloignez de moi cette tentation d amour qui me livrerait pour toujours a Vous Que le vide s etende entre mon coeur et le ciel Je ne souhaite point mes deserts peuples de votre presence mes nuits tyrannisees par votre lumiere mes Siberies fondues sous votre soleil Plus seul que vous je veux mes mains pures au rebours des votres qui se souillerent a jamais en petrissant la terre et en se melant des affaires du monde Je ne demande a votre stupide omnipotence que le The Order of Impossible Salvation  respect de ma solitude et de mes tourments Je n ai que faire de vos paroles et je crains la folie qui me les ferait entendre Dispensezmoi la paix que vous ne putes tolerer et qui vous incita a menager une breche dans le neant pour y ouvrir cette foire des temps et pour me condamner ainsi a l univers a l humiliation et a la honte d etre Pl  Lord give me the faculty of never praying spare me the insanity of all adoration remove from me this temptation of love that would deliver me over forever to You May the void spread itself out between my heart and heaven I do not wish for my deserts to be peopled with your presence my nights tyrannized by your light my Siberias melted under your sun More alone than you I want my hands to be pure the opposite of yours that sullied themselves for good by forming the earth and getting involved in the affairs of the world I only ask from your stupid omnipotence the respect of my solitude and my torments I have no use for your words and I fear the madness that would make me hear them Exempt me from the peace that you could not tolerate and that led you to contrive a breach in the nothingness to open there this fair of time and to condemn me thus to the universe to the humiliation and the shame of being Although Cioran offers this prayer in parentheses it contains an essential aspect of his vision and an important source of distinction from Baudelaire We saw that the latter blasphemes in the satanic poems of Revolte in a way that simply reverses good and evil by singing the praises of Satan In Baudelaire this was an intermediary step a fruitless negation en route to the ultimate and impossible solution of non existence While Cioran would agree that nonexistence is ultimately preferable to existence his form of blasphemy in the prayer quoted here has nothing to do with the simplistic Satanism through which Baudelaire s speaking subject passes Rather God himself becomes the temptation here By asking to be free from prayer and to have the void interposed between his heart and the heavens Cioran implies that conventional prayer is a temptation to be resisted not because in a quasiNietzschean sense it would be a sign of weakness or slave mentality but because it would anchor the subject even more firmly in an existence from which he knows it is best to flee In this sense the temptation to interact with God is related to what Cioran cal s in the title of one of his books the temptation to exist both of those temptations stem from the difficulty we have not only in admitting that nonexistence is preferable at least until suffering convinces us but also in having the courage to follow through and draw al the consequences of that realization It should be clear by now that the stakes are high in Cioran in terms of elaborating the full complexity of the asoteriology he proposes in sometimes terrifyingly brief aphoristic form The remnants of the theological emerge in his writings in forms comparable to those of thinkers such as Agamben zizek and others who have turned toward similarlyminded investigations of the theological in the early twentyfirst century It would thus be wrong to see Cioran simply as a nihilist as he has sometimes been interpreted Nicolas Cavailles indicates at the outset of his booklength study of  The Fall Out of Redemption Cioran that despite himself no doubt Cioran sees his work divided up among three exclusive types of readers the adolescent the philosopher and the poet Cavailles   and it is true that certain passages of Cioran taken on their own do seem to suggest a sort of postromantic adolescent revolt against the world by a tormented soul Tout est rien rien n est L une et l autre formule apportent une egale serenite L anxieux pour son malheur reste entre les deux tremblant et perplexe toujours a la merci d une nuance incapable de s etablir dans la securite de l etre ou de l absence d etre Everything is nothing nothing is Both formulas bring an equal serenity The anxious man to his misery remains between the two trembling and perplexed always at the mercy of a nuance incapable of establishing himself in the security of being or of the absence of being Pl   But the theological and philosophical stakes implied by the attempt to think beyond idealism existentialism and every other systematic philosophy and to pursue a revisionary path that differs significantly from that of Nietzsche even as it shares some of the same impulses to negate but not simply destroy what came before make it impossible to reduce Cioran to a form of adolescent nihilism that would be content to proclaim the meaninglessness of human endeavor He does to be sure repeatedly assert such meaninglessness but those assertions need to be taken as a local moment within his larger project of working through the implications of a refusal of the soteriological vision since his question of a quoi bon what s the use repeatedly yields to an impulse to keep writing and to refuse to come to rest in a simple and simplistic negative vision This perpetuation of writing is a source of both satisfaction and torment and as I have implied the torment is a necessary product of existence which is set up to preclude the possibility of resolution in anything other than nonexistence at which point there would be no subject available to perceive the end of the torment Cioran is no more able to come to an end than Baudelaire despite the necessity of the literary text coming to an end That is perhaps the most poetic character of Cioran s writing far more so than his moments of lyricism He participates in the problematics of the end that we analyzed in Baudelaire through Agamben s estheticotheological meditations on the notion of closure Cioran goes further than refusing closure however he also suggests that new beginnings are impossible Chercher la souffrance pour eviter le rachat suivre a rebours le chemin de la delivrance tel est notre apport en matiere de religion des il umines bilieux des Bouddhas et des Christs hostiles au salut prechant aux miserables le charme de leur detresse To seek suffering to avoid redemption to follow the way of deliverance backwards that is what we bring when it comes to religion irritable enlightened ones Buddhas and Christs hostile to salvation preaching to the wretched the charm of their distress Pl   He goes on to claim in this passage that a step beyond the JudeoChristian worldview corrupt since Adam but not for the reasons typical y given would be to debaptiser l univers par oter l etiquette qui apposee sur chaque apparence la releve et lui prete un simulacre de sens unbaptize the universe to remove the label which appended on each appearance raises it and lends it a simulacrum of sense Pl   There is an echo of the Rimbaud of Une saison en enfer A Season in Hel here who claims to be esclave de s on bapteme the slave of his baptism Rimbaud   meaning The Order of Impossible Salvation  that the effects of baptism are permanent in that even if one were to renounce one s faith baptism itself cannot be canceled or reversed Cioran implies here that with the act of naming comes a conferring of meaning that is like the baptismal act itself impossible to cancel even though it may be shown to be false or more likely in Cioran s case even though one sees the assigning of meaning as a step in the wrong direction a fall into the human world of meaning progression linearity and all the rest of the fundamental y human experience that Cioran wishes to cancel Aurelien Demers identifies three potential solutions to the problem of irredeemable human experience as Cioran defines it namely via the child the primitive or the insane but goes on to demonstrate why all of these are not ultimately tenable as potential solutions the child possesses an enviable but ephemeral and unrecoverable destiny the primitive enjoys a relatively preferable but impossible condition the crazy man has received a touch of the providential hand of chance on his existence but his luck is inaccessible One thus never escapes the fatality of the fal  What makes the fal is thus consciousness Demers   Once meaning is established with the naming of the universe and the things in it the drama of humanity s perdition and then its potential redemption is put in motion and this is precisely the narrative that Cioran wishes to invalidate by invalidating all sense of linear temporal progression His own writings often taking the form of isolated fragments perform the kind of change he advocates by refusing to follow a narrative scheme or a systematic progression of argument This refusal of narrative echoes the refusal of the idea of redemption which is at least before Agamben theorizes them as simultaneous fundamental y temporal and linear in nature a fal  followed by the cancel ation of the fal  If one accepts even this basic minimum of redemptive structure the Christian narrative appears to contain at least a simulacrum of sense which is precisely what we should refuse to pretend to give to lived reality Instead we should recognize the permanence of human corruption Aucunement accidentelle notre corruption est permanente elle est de toujours De meme l iniquite abusivement taxee de mystere  elle est une evidence elle est meme ce qu il y a de plus visible icibas ou remettre les choses en place exigerait un sauveur pour chaque generation pour chaque individu plutot Not at all accidental our corruption is permanent and from all time The same goes for iniquity abusively labeled a mystery it is something obvious it is even what is most visible here below where to put things back in place would require a savior for each generation or rather for each individual Pl   Recognizing what is immediately visible to us is what allows us successful y to surpass the logic of redemption and the linear temporality on which it depends But once again this is no easy feat despite the fact that it simply involves taking account of what is already visible to us in the world This is so because salvation appears to us as a temptation and like all temptations its results are ultimately nefarious and lead us into error Le salut finit tout et il nous finit Qui une fois sauve ose se dire encore vivant On ne vit reellement que par le refus de se delivrer de la souffrance et comme par une  The Fall Out of Redemption tentation religieuse de l irreligiosite Le salut ne hante que les assassins et les saints ceux qui ont tue ou depasse la creature les autres se vautrent ivres morts dans l imperfection Pl  Salvation finishes everything and it finishes us Who once saved dares to call himself still living One only real y lives by the refusal to deliver oneself from suffering and as if by a religious temptation of irreligiosity Salvation haunts only assassins and saints those who have killed or gone beyond the creature others wallow dead drunk in imperfection Salvation joins God and existence in a network of temptations to which we succumb by the act of living daily life Cioran extends this analysis by calling hope a sickness a position that would be difficult to defend without these preliminary observations about the related notion of salvation as a temptation Qui n est pas imbu de la conviction que tout est vain Mais qui ose en affronter les suites L homme a vocation metaphysique est plus rare qu un monstre et pourtant chaque homme contient virtuellement les elements de cette vocation Nous ne pouvons renoncer a quoi que ce soit cependant les evidences de la vanite sont a notre portee Malades d espoir nous attendons toujours et la vie n est que l attente devenue hypostase Nous attendons tout meme le Rien plutot que d etre reduits a une suspension eternelle a une condition de divinite neutre ou de cadavre Ainsi le coeur qui s est fait un axiome de l Irreparable en espere encore des surprises L humanite vit amoureusement dans les evenements qui la nient  Pl  Who is not steeped in the conviction that all is vanity But who dares to confront the consequences of that The man with a metaphysical vocation is rarer than a monster and yet each man contains virtual y the elements of this vocation We cannot renounce anything yet the proofs of vanity are within our reach Sick with hope we wait forever and life is only a wait that has become hypostasis We await everything even the Nothing rather than be reduced to an eternal suspension to a condition of neutral divinity or cadaver Thus the heart that has made for itself an axiom of the Irreparable still hopes for surprises from it Humanity lives lovingly in events that negate it The advantage of the sickness metaphor is that it removes the question of agency potential y inherent in the notion of temptation In its place sickness provides the context of our minds and bodies against or beyond our will in order to accomplish an action which is detrimental or destructive to us Cioran s emphasis on our incapability to renounce not only hope but anything else we might want brings us back to the difficulty of thinking beyond redemption and suggests that it acts in a somewhat parasitic way on our thought imposing its logic even on the most valiant attempts to think beyond it The problem then is not so much that we cannot renounce hope The Order of Impossible Salvation  but that we cannot even imagine what it would be like to do so The same will be true of redemption despite Cioran s many attempts to surpass it and fulfill the dictates of lucid knowledge But as we shall see in the next chapter an intermittent or temporary redemption is ultimately the furthest his own thought can take him Cioran overturns traditional thinking about redemption but not by a simple reversal Again a we have already seen with Baudelaire simple negation while it may be a stop on the way toward mature thinking is not part of what I have been calling asoteriological thinking because such negation depends on the structure of redemption itself in the same way that Satanism depends on the existence of Christianity in order to have any sense whatsoever Rather Cioran is seeking to think beyond the category of redemption itself precisely because of the killing effect it has on the human subject But as we see yet again here thinking beyond redemption also implies thinking beyond endings not only in the eschatological sense but also in the expanded sense that we need to read in the assertion that salvation finishes everything The reason that no simple negation is possible in the case of salvation is that since salvation brings a definitive and final answer thinking beyond salvation necessarily implies a refusal of those kinds of answer  Cioran s constant return to paradox is cocommittant with his obsessive focus on salvation Simona Modreanu identifies a link between paradox and the fall Cioran sees paradox as the figure par excel ence of the Fal  as a materialization of difference irony of the human condition and verbal irony at the same time Adam fell with an imperfect viaticum a language inept at naming precisely and a thought insufficient for apprehending or circumscribing the Absolute from whence comes the permanent discomfort that Cioran acknowledges in his existence and that paradox translates best because it expresses the incapacity to be natural y in the world   Dieu   Moreover the attempt to think beyond redemption necessarily results in paradox because any sort of definitive answer even one that resembled damnation would be dependent on the logic of redemption precisely because it is the logic of the definitive end Intriguingly Cioran goes on in this same passage to link poetry to the refusal of redemption Le tort de toute doctrine de la delivrance est de supprimer la poesie climat de l inacheve Le poete se trahirait s il aspirait a se sauver le salut est la mort du chant la negation de l art et de l esprit Comment se sentir solidaire d un aboutissement Nous pouvons raffiner jardiner nos douleurs mais par quel moyen nous en emanciper sans nous suspendre Pl  What every doctrine of deliverance does wrong is to suppress poetry climate of the unfinished The poet would betray himself if he aspired to save himself salvation is the death of song the negation of art and spirit How to feel solidarity  The Fall Out of Redemption with an end We can refine cultivate our sorrows but by what means can we emancipate ourselves from them without suspending ourselves We should avoid the temptation to read poetry here in the generalized and superficial sense of emotional excess in a romantic vein Such a reading might be encouraged by the reference to suffering But in light of the deeper and more complex connections we have been working out between philosophical and esthetic concerns or more specifical y between metaphysics and poetry Cioran explores territory here that we have traced in a complex intratemporal web between Baudelaire and Agamben Those two writers have helped us see what is at stake in Cioran s remarks here which is something far beyond the idea of redemption putting an end to physical or emotional pain The poet betrays himself if he strives for redemption not because it is the poet s function to give voice to raw emotion but because redemption is linked to endings and as we have seen the poem both strives toward and actively resists its own ending which would be the end of the poem itself Thus the poet must always reach a compromise solution between on the one hand abandoning poetry itself by accepting the logic of redemption and on the other remaining incapable of ending a poem and thus fulfilling the creative act But if it is impossible definitively to abandon hope poetry s status becomes problematic since Cioran describes poetry as a corrective to hope Entre la poesie et l esperance l incompatibilite est complete aussi le poete est il victime d une ardente decomposition Qui oserait se demander comment il a ressenti la vie quand c est par la mort qu il a ete vivant Lorsqu il succombe a la tentation du bonheur il appartient a la comedie Mais si par contre des flammes emanent de ses plaies et qu il chante la felicite cette incandescence voluptueuse du malheur il se soustrait a la nuance de vulgarite inherente a tout accent positif  Pl  Between poetry and hope the incompatibility is complete therefore the poet is the victim of an ardent decomposition Who would dare wonder how he felt life when it is by death that he was living When he succumbs to the temptation of happiness he belongs to the comedy  But if on the other hand flames emanate from his wounds and he sings his felicity that voluptuous incandenscence of unhappiness he subtracts himself from the hint of vulgarity inherent in all positive accent  Cioran leads us to two competing versions of the way to go on with life since both poetry and hope fulfill the function of allowing life to continue yet they are at odds with each other which suggests that one of the two should be incompatible with life s continuation The end of either poetry or hope would be the end of existence but in the case of Cioran it is not possible to affirm definitively that existence is preferable to nonexistence In fact just the opposite may be true but again in the absence of our ability to experience nothingness a definitive position is impossible and at any The Order of Impossible Salvation  rate a definitive positiontaking would constitute the kind of definitive end that all of Cioran s thought and style refuse The temporal space of his writing is rather messianic in Agamben s sense his writing represents the time it takes for time to come to an end rather than itself coming to rest conceptual y or esthetical y in an end itself  All of this might seem to lead to a clear and definitive if at first counterintuitive conclusion If God and existence are temptations if nothingness is at least hypothetical y better than existence and if redemption is not a helpful but an il usory category it would seem that redemption would lie in getting beyond redemption Cioran in fact states this in De l inconvenient d etre ne La certitude qu il n y a pas de salut est une forme de salut elle est meme le salut a partir de la on peut aussi bien organiser sa propre vie que construire une philosophie de l histoire L insoluble comme solution comme seule issue The certainty that there is no salvation is a form of salvation it is even salvation itself From there one can organize one s own life as well as construct a philosophy of history The insoluble as solution as the only way out Pl   So abandoning salvation is itself a salvation while the formulation is paradoxical it is consistent with virtual y all of Cioran s reflections on related topics We seem to have arrived at a satisfying conclusion salvation is il usory and dangerous and while it may seem undesirable to try to get beyond it it is in our best interests to do so and liberation from an il usion about our own good lies in the balance Such a simple and categorical answer is not however possible and not just because humans hold their il usions dear First of al  certitude is itself a problematic category in Cioran Bringing thought and writing to a definitive end in certitude is not the same as bringing existence to an end in nothingness and while we continue to exist it is impossible to assert certitude according to Cioran s most powerful assertions Other aspects of Cioran s thought mitigate the definitive abandoning of redemption as a category Even the statement I have just quoted and provisional y labeled definitive does not withstand scrutiny in fact it demonstrates its own impossibility If knowing that there is no salvation is salvation we are effectively locked in the logic of salvation and not just because it is a comforting il usion Removing the comforting il usion does nothing to remove the redemptive logic at work in affirming no redemption as a kind of redemption the more we attempt to think beyond that category the further we become mired in it Moreover Cioran s statement could in fact be read as a critique and not an assertion of the position that getting beyond salvation is itself redemptive salvation is il usory and certitude about the lack of salvation is salvation and is thus il usory Seeing the statement as a critique is in line with what Cioran would often imply about such activities as organizing one s life and constructing a philosophy of history both of which seem like impossible tasks according to much of Cioran s writing So while the statement about certitude of no salvation seems definitive it itself escapes condemnation as a dead end by being legible simultaneously in two contradictory senses At the moment when Cioran seems closest to certainty and to definitive assertion he is in fact most ful y mired in duality This then is our first suggestion of an answer to the question of why it cannot be so easy as to assert the end of salvation and our attempt  The Fall Out of Redemption to explain why this is the case leads us to the heart of Cioran s thought the notion of the fal  which links the lack of redemption to an irrepressible duality Thus we need to take a closer look at his writing on original sin and the fall in order to gain deeper insight into his infinite struggle with redemptive logic We shall see in the next chapter that as was the case with all the theological terrain we have examined so far Cioran both depends on and subverts it removing theological discourse from the category of belief and assigning it greater heuristic value than myth but stopping short of elevating it to a systematic philosophy  The Eternal Fall Cioran Cioran s conception of the fall is multifaceted and articulated throughout his work sometimes in brief references and sometimes in more elaborated development The idea of the fall for which he is best known is the double conception of it as a fall both into and out of time We shall consider this idea further below but it would be far too simple to frame Cioran s notion of the fall around a single idea given the weight it has as a foundational concept it has in all of his thought As an original y theological concept it holds primacy over all other explanatory conceptualizations even though it is important to emphasize once again the separation we should maintain here from traditional questions of belief Cioran comments on this distinction in the Cahiers Notebooks Je ne crois pas au Peche dans le sens chretien Mais je crois que l homme est un animal marque qu il est reellement affecte d une tare initiale et c est grace a elle qu il a glisse de la condition animale a la condition humaine I do not believe in Sin in the Christian sense But I believe man is a marked animal that he is real y affected by an initial stain and that it is thanks to that that he slid from the animal condition to the human condition C   Best then to see the theological as a competing discourse with philosophy psychology and so on and as the winner in that competition precisely because the way Cioran appropriates theological discourse gives it tremendous heuristic power and allows us to see competing approaches as an outgrowth of theology rather than its competitor Thus for instance this comment from the Cahiers La fameuse agressivite que Freud a presentee comme une grande decouverte est une des composantes essentielles du Peche originel La psychanalyse est pour l essentiel tributaire de la theologie Chez l une et l autre la meme vision impitoyable de l homme The famous aggressivity that Freud presented as a great discovery is one of the essential components of Original Sin Psychoanalysis is essential y a tributary of theology In both the same merciless vision of man C   Given the overarching importance of the fal  it is thus necessary to establish a web of related concepts which Cioran addresses near and through his considerations of it First of al  Cioran continues Baudelaire s use of the fall as a critique of or corrective to the notion of progress The fal s cancel ation of linear time precludes a notion of development by condemning humans to an eternal return to the conditions of the fall Tout pas en avant toute forme de dynamisme comporte quelque chose de satanique le progres est l equivalent moderne de la Chute la version profane  The Fall Out of Redemption de la damnation Et ceux qui y croient et en sont les promoteurs nous tous en definitive que sommesnous sinon des reprouves en marche predestines a l immonde a ces machines a ces villes dont seul un desastre exhaustif pourrait nous debarrasser Ce serait la pour nos inventions l occasion ou jamais de prouver leur utilite et de se rehabiliter a nos yeux Pl  Every step forward every form of dynamism includes something satanic progress is the modern equivalent of the Fal  the profane version of damnation And those who believe in it and are its promoters all of us no doubt what are we if not condemned ones on the move predestined to the vile to these machines these cities of which one exhaustive disaster could rid us That would be the nowornever chance for our inventions to prove their utility and rehabilitate themselves in our eyes There are echoes here of Baudelaire s satanic revolt as an effort to break through ennui toward potential action even if it is the negative action of the disaster But like Baudelaire Cioran is unable to confirm the desirability or even the possibility of the catastrophic solution to the problem of the fal  since it is hard to see how the catastrophe could do anything but reinforce the conditions of the fall that it purportedly cancels Cioran extends this critique of progress by identifying the way each attempt to surpass our humanity only leads us further away from our ability to transcend ourselves On peut attribuer a une tare cette force centrifuge cette force funeste qui l eloigne l homme de luimeme plus il cherche sa vraie nature plus il s en ecarte et la fuit et quand il sera arrive a l extreme de cette fuite il eclatera ou sombrera One can attribute to a stain this centrifugal force this diastrous force that moves man away from himself the more he seeks his true nature the more he distances himself from it and flees it and when he arrives at the end of this flight he will explode or sink C   A key passage of the Precis extends Cioran s interpretation of the fall while identifying the breach with traditional theology s linkage of the fall and redemption Qu estce que la Chute sinon la poursuite d une verite et l assurance de l avoir trouvee la passion pour un dogme l etablissement dans un dogme  Un etre possede par une croyance et qui ne chercherait pas a la communiquer aux autres est un phenomene etranger a la terre ou l obsession du salut rend la vie irrespirable regardez autour de vous partout des larves qui prechent  L envie de devenir source d evenements agit sur chacun comme un desordre mental ou comme une malediction voulue La societe un enfer de sauveurs Ce qu y cherchait Diogene avec sa lanterne c etait un indifferent Pl  What is the fall if not the pursuit of a truth and the assurance of having found it the passion for a dogma establishment in a dogma  A being possessed by a belief and who would not seek to communicate it to others is a phenomenon foreign to the earth where the obssession of salvation render The Eternal Fall Cioran  life unbreathable look around you everywhere larvae who preach  The desire to become a source of events acts on each person like a mental disorder or a welcome curse Society a hell of saviors What Diogenes was looking for with his lantern was an indifferent person Paradoxical y at first glance remaining faithful to the logic of the fall would thus require forgetting the traditional ways in which the consequences of the fall are lived The movement that Cioran traces here is a fundamental y negative one that attempts to rebuild the notion of the fall on a different basis and with significantly different consequences for a philosophy of lived experience Not surprisingly a reconsideration of salvation appears at the heart of this challenge to traditional thinking about the fal  But the first move here is to establish distance between the fall and certitude no easy feat for a thinker who expresses such certainty each time he addresses the question of humanity s tainted fallen nature The solution at which he arrives involves not so much the existence of certainty but the kinds of consequences for action that one draws from that certainty Cioran establishes a break between certitude and action by refusing to proclaim as opposed to simply living out the certainty of the fal  Already the fall is double here Cioran the theorist of the fal  who is by virtue of that role committed to the notion of the fal  separates himself from the proselytizers of the fal  who only proclaim it because of their remaining within the logic of salvation For them salvation originates from proclaiming the fal  presumably with an eye toward its cancelation To be caught in the logic of redemption is however another sign of the fal  given that redemption is impossible those who cannot get beyond redemption are enmeshed even further in the consequences of the fal  So for both Cioran s speaking subject and for the proclaimers of the fall from whom he distances himself the fall is operational Lucidity about its irreparability does nothing to cancel its effects while proclaiming it only buries us deeper in its consequences Such a totalizing phenomenon will not allow a loosening of its effects it is for this reason that as we have already seen knowledge that there can be no salvation cannot itself be a form of salvation If Cioran s speaking voice here takes on something of the prophet it is only to condemn and refuse even a trace of soteriological logic that logic is as Cioran indicates what makes life unbreatheable and therefore we need to see any salvific promise to make life more bearable as a contributor to that unbreatheable atmosphere Rather than casting an eye at a futureoriented redemption the best we can do is to engage in fictions in order to be able to continue to live since lucidity about the possibility of redemption release or progress renders other options impossible  The Cioranian subject still engaging with the world must do so in the domain of the asif this is the realm of fictions not as dangerous il usion but rather as a hypothesis whose validity must be declared impossible but which allows us to function in the world in the absence of a perceivable passage into nonexistence There is more to say about the role of fiction for Cioran but for now it suffices to note its potential as an alternative to the discourse of redemption a positively valued kind of lucid il usion that Cioran opposes to history which the French Cioran consistently  The Fall Out of Redemption dismisses as not only il usory but dangerous the worst kind of delusion on account of its horrific consequences Cioran s postWorld War II engagement with the idea of history is a wholesale dismissal of his early political engagement which sought the transformation of his native Romania through a misguided alliance with fascism a view on which he comments in  in his Cahiers C est la pire folie de ma jeunesse  Si je suis gueri d une maladie c est bien cellela It is the worst fol y of my youth  If I am cured of one sickness it is surely that one C   His later view of history condemns the pursuit of historical progress or transformation by both the right and the left both of which fall prey too easily to the myth of the betterment of humanity with the disastrous and bloody consequences we see lived out in the twentieth century as in any other period that dedicated itself to such misguided ends as human improvement L Histoire manufacture d ideaux  mythologie lunatique frenesie des hordes et des solitaires  refus d envisager la realite telle quelle soif mortelle de fictions  Mais vivre c est s aveugler sur ses propres dimensions  Qui avec la vision exacte de sa nullite tenterait d etre efficace et de s eriger en sauveur Pl  History factory of ideals  lunatic mythology frenzy of hordes and solitaries  refusal to envisage reality as is deadly thirst for fictions  But to live is to blind oneself about one s own dimensions  Who with a precise vision of his nullity would attempt to be effective and to set himself up as a savior Several categories of Cioran s thought come together here with history aligned with redemption and refused outright while the proper pursuit becomes the appropriate attitude toward fiction as lucid tool for living rather than vehicle of the lunatic mythology of history and its worst kind of realization of illusory thought through bloody action  As Sylvain David indicates Cioran does not directly evoke his error and aberrations but he transposes the problematic of adhesion to common values to an ontological absolute level By doing this Cioran finds himself projecting on all of humanity what at its origin constitutes a personal mistake David   an important move in what David calls Cioran s negative heroism   The question is thus not one of illusion versus truth but rather of distinguishing between nourishing and poisoning fictions in the realm of quasilucidity which is the only conceptual zone in which any kind of living activity is possible for Cioran It is crucial not to try to overcome belief but rather to come to consciousness of belief as belief in order to remain within the realm of nourishing fiction In a passage whose opening ideas echo the famous opening of Les Fleurs du Mal in their evocation of la sottise l erreur le peche la lesine folly error sin avarice which occupent nos esprits et travaillent nos corps occupy our minds and labor our bodies  OC   Cioran declares Nous croyons tous a bien plus de choses que nous ne pensons et defendant nos idees avec des moyens extremes nous parcourons le monde comme des The Eternal Fall Cioran  forteresses ambulantes et irrefragables Chacun est pour soimeme un dogme supreme nulle theologie ne protege son dieu comme nous protegeons notre moi et ce moi si nous l assiegeons de doutes et le mettons en question ce n est que par une fausse elegance de notre orgueil la cause est gagnee d avance Pl  We all believe in many more things than we think and defending ideas with extreme measures we travel the world like walking uncontradictable fortresses Each one is for himself a supreme dogma no theology protects its god the way we protect our self and this self if we besiege it with doubts and put it in question it is only by a false elegance of our pride the cause is won in advance This passage suggests that there can be a tyranny of thought as well as action certainty in one s convictions leads to poisonous cognitive as well as historical results What masquerades as positive or creative energy in defending ideas becomes a destructive force precisely because a basis of certainty can never be established thus making the coercive power of thought inherent in the thought itself rather than in any externally verified source In light of the possibility of fictions becoming a danger rather a vehicle for living we need to inquire whether redemption can be a fiction of the nontotalizing healthy variety given that Cioran has linked it to history by virtue of their common teleological orientation Can the notion of salvation itself be saved by considering it a fiction in a positive sense As long as we are lucid about the fictional nature of salvation can we admit it as an appropriate conceptual framework The answer based on the passage just quoted has to be no because of salvational logic s totalizing nature The very fact that it is difficult if not impossible to think beyond redemption clearly indicates that by Cioran s criteria soteriology is a totalizing discourse that manifests itself tyrannical y not necessarily by always presenting itself as dogmatic but rather by not allowing a space by which we might think beyond it Salvational logic in this sense colonizes all other thought and pushes us in the direction of certainty rather than doubt making it difficult to maintain salvational logic at the level of fiction in the positive sense and reinforcing the link that Cioran establishes between redemption and history What certainty of historical vision does to the historical actor salvational logic does to the thinker even if the thinker attempts to deny the certainty of that logic and thus salvational logic becomes even more insidious than historical logic since the latter does allow conceptual space for thinking beyond it Once again poetry comes to play an important role in articulating some of the relationships we have been tracing here among history redemption and lucid il usion While Cioran s comments on poetry are fewer in number than his references to these other topics a careful reading of those remarks can provide helpful insight into the way Cioran attempts to think through and beyond soteriological discourse Mais un Shelley mais un Baudelaire mais un Rilke interviennent au plus profond de notre organisme qui se les annexe ainsi qu il le ferait d un vice Dans leur voisinage un corps se fortifie puis s amollit et se desagrege Car le poete est un  The Fall Out of Redemption agent de destruction un virus une maladie deguisee et le danger le plus grave encore que merveilleusement imprecis pour nos globules rouges Vivre dans ses parages c est sentir le sang s amincir c est rever un paradis de l anemie et entendre dans les veines des larmes ruisseler  Pl  But a Shelley a Baudelaire a Rilke intervenes in the deepest part of our organism which annexes them as it would a vice In their vicinity a body fortifies itself then softens and disintegrates For the poet is an agent of destruction a virus a disguised illness and the most serious danger even though marvelously imprecise for our red corpuscles To live in his vicinity is to feel one s blood thin and to dream of a paradise of anemia and to hear in one s veins tears streaming  Like many of Cioran s comments on poetry this one at first seems to reveal a straightforward and not terribly interesting or original point that is that poets are decadent or degenerate and thus as has been repeated since Plato have a nefarious effect on their audience In the larger context of Cioran s thought however a more complex reading emerges from the concept of the poet as agent of destruction Given the positive role that destruction has in terms of bringing us out of the dogmatic slumber that Cioran identifies with the dangerous fictions and mythologies that generate the catastrophes of history and its action poets play an important role here If they turn us away from our taste for acting in the world that can only be to our advantage under the conditions of Cioranian lucidity The danger is only operative for our selves as we normal y construct them in the haze of the il usions that allow us to continue normal functioning in the world In that sense the poets are agents not only of destruction but of the kind of lucidity that would generate the positive kinds of fiction that allow us to live without falling prey to the dangerous kind of il usions In that sense poets become a kind of model for how to mitigate between the lucidity that leads to total inaction and agency in the world that leads to il usion As artistic creators poets already navigate the terrain of lucid il usion a point to which we shall have occasion to return Cioran confirms the reading of the advantages of the supposedly dangerous poets by rendering more explicit the way in which poets can perform the work of philosophers better than the philosophers themselves still in a corrective or destructive mode Bien plutot qu a l ecole des philosophes c est a celle des poetes qu on apprend le courage de l intelligence et l audace d etre soimeme Leurs affirmations font palir les propos les plus etrangement impertinents des sophistes anciens Personne ne les adopte y eutil jamais un seul penseur qui fut alle aussi loin que Baudelaire  Pl  Rather than at the school of philosophers it is at that of the poets that one learns the courage of intelligence and the audacity of being oneself Their affirmations make the most strangely impertinent propositions of the ancient sophists pale in comparison No one adopts them was there ever a single thinker who went as far as Baudelaire  The Eternal Fall Cioran  If as we have seen Cioran posits his own writing voice as a kind of prophet the poet as he is figured here becomes a kind of model Rather than seeing maxims or prescriptions in the poems we are asked to admire and imitate the mode of thought that generates the poetry a participation in esthetic creation that involves the courage to situate oneself within doubt in a way that no systematic philosopher can allow himself to do without contradicting the very nature of a proposition At many points then Cioran tends toward a philosophy of practice one rooted in a thought that would take lucid account of futility and the ideal of nothingness but that would nonetheless allow some kind of functioning and some kind of thought as functioning in the world This linking of the esthetic and the ethical returns us to the terrain of redemption and allows us further insight into the way it functions for Cioran We have already seen that it would be liberating to be rid of the idea of redemption but this kind of liberation is impossible so that the elimination of redemption becomes a kind of regulatory ideal something to which we should aspire in full knowledge of the impossibility of fulfilling the goal In that sense asoteriology performs the kind of endlessness that it theorizes if a refusal to come to an end is a hallmark of the attempt to think beyond redemption since getting beyond redemption also means surpassing teleology and thus eschatology then the endless and fruitless pursuit of the impossibility of redemption is the appropriate path to take This puts us in a better position to understand Cioran s notion of an Order of Impossible Salvation The monastic reference enforces the notion of practice along with the idea of fidelity in thought and action to a guiding principle in this case the easily demonstrable impossibility of salvation The context is one of a religious practice without the trappings of belief in the traditional sense one in which the creative work of the poets could be seen as a practice that enacts and reacts to the consequences of impossible salvation a kind of creative destruction In all of this there is an ambiguous relation to the concept of mystery The Order of Impossible Salvation itself will be we recal  un Ordre affranchi des mysteres et dont nul frere ne se reclamerait de rien dedaignant son salut comme celui des autres empancipated from mysteries and of which no brother would ask anything disdaining his salvation and that of others Pl   But as in the case of salvation itself mystery is not so easy to refuse and in some sense the practice of the hypothetical Order of Impossible Salvation would also involve conceiving and living out the consequences of this declared liberation from mystery Elsewhere Cioran writes A l aide de quels artifices trouverionsnous la force de l il usion pour aller en quete d une autre vie d une vie nouvelle Je n ai connu aucune vie nouvelle qui ne fut il usoire et compromise en ses racines J ai vu chaque homme avancer dans le temps pour s isoler dans une rumination angoissee et retomber en lui meme avec en guise de renouvellement la grimace imprevue de ses propres espoirs Pl   With the aid of what artifice would we find the strength of il usion to go on a quest for another life a new life I have known no new life that was not il usory  The Fall Out of Redemption and compromised at its roots I have seen each man advance in time in order to isolate himself in an anguished rumination and to fall back in himself with in the guise of renewal the unexpected grimace of his own hopes The question is far from merely rhetorical the status of il usion in its manifestation through thought action artistic creation and so on and in its link with or opposition to lucidity is what is most at stake for Cioran when he is working through the consequences of asoteriology as a faithful practitioner in the Order of Impossible Salvation The complexity of these questions as it reveals itself in the web of contexts throughout Cioran s entire corpus is what takes Cioran s thought and writing far from the world of adolescent pleasures of vituperation against the world The resurging up from mystery into lucidity is always followed by a complication of the conceptual scenario that plunges us back into the arena of thought as praxis in the impossible yet crucial task of articulating and then living or articulating while living the consequences of impossible salvation Poets are in a unique position for Cioran for not only do they perform the destructive work that allows us to break through to lucidity but they also as we saw through Agamben and Baudelaire struggle with what it means to live in the time of comingtoanend without actual y achieving the end via the nature of the poem as that which both pushes on toward its end and actively resists it Moreover their working in the medium of language also further implicates them in the consequences of Cioranian lucidity Si par chaque mot nous remportons une victoire sur le neant ce n est que pour mieux en subir l empire Nous mourons en proportion des mots que nous jetons tout autour de nous La vie n est que cette impatience de dechoir de prostituer les solitudes virginales de l ame par le dialogue negation immemoriale du Paradis Pl  If by each word we score a victory over nothingness it is only the better to fall under the influence of its empire We die in proportion to the words that we throw around us Life is only this impatience to demean oneself to prostitute the virginal solitude of the soul by dialogue immemorial negation of Paradise Cioran s comment reminds us that that while esthetic creation might be a kind of temporary overcoming of nothingness it cannot be itself a kind of redemption as Nietzsche conceived it The multifaceted conception of nihilism is evident here in that esthetic creation both cancels and participates in the nothingness Neither simple negation nor construction nothingness takes on a dynamic character that is evident in the proliferation of words by which and in which we live and die Each word proferred is a robbery from the virtual into the actual This is not to say however that silence has any salvific effect since our silence is only the imitation of a genuine silence Point de salut sinon dans l imitation du silence Mais notre loquacite est prenatale Race de phraseurs de spermatozoides verbeux nous sommes chimiquement lies au The Eternal Fall Cioran  Mot No salvation at al  unless in the imitation of silence But our loquacity is prenatal Race of sentencemakers verbose spermatozoids we are chemical y linked to the Word Pl   In La Tentation d Exister The Temptation to Exist  Cioran continues to associate poets and a creative form of nihilism linked to the poet s destructive work on the ordinary use of language itself a kind of refusal of everyday reality and its alliance with il usion Le poete lui prend le langage au serieux Il s en cree un a sa facon Toutes ses singularites procedent de son intolerance aux mots tels quels Inapte a en supporter la banalite et l usure il est predestine a souffrir a cause d eux et pour eux et cependant c est par eux qu il essaie de se sauver c est de leur regeneration qu il attend son salut Quelque grincante que soit sa vision des choses il n est jamais un vrai negateur Pl  The poet takes language seriously He creates himself one in his own manner All his singularities proceed from his intolerance of words as they are Incapable of tolerating the banality and wear of them he is predestined to suffer because of them and for them and yet it is by them that he attempts to save himself it is from their regeneration that he awaits his salvation No matter how grating his vision of things may be he is never a true negator We can ask the same question about poets as we can about Cioran s speaking subject himself is it in fact ever possible to be a true negator Does absolute negation act as a kind of regulatory ideal or is there in fact a way to be a true nihilist The passage reveals more about the complex status of nihilism for Cioran than it does about the task of the poet who in this instance seems again like Cioran s speaking subject an intensified version of the human subject generally given as he is to nihilism while unable to sustain an actual affirmation of nothingness and accomplishing creative work that both destroys and affirms Cioran makes an exception for the poets not because they have access to truth in fact they operate fully within illusion  but because of their particular kind of illusion Puisque le poete est un monstre qui tente son salut par le mot et qu il supplee au vide de l univers par le symbole meme du vide car le mot estil autre chose  pourquoi ne le suivrionsnous pas dans son exceptionnelle il usion Il devient notre recours toutes les fois que nous desertons les fictions du langage courant pour nous en chercher d autres insolites sinon rigoureuses Ne sembletil pas alors que toute autre irrealite est preferable a la notre et qu il y a plus de substance dans un vers que dans tous ces mots trivialises par nos conversations ou nos prieres Que la poesie doive etre accessible ou hermetique efficace ou gratuite c est la un probleme secondaire Exercice ou revelation qu importe Nous lui demandons nous autres qu elle nous delivre de l oppression des affres du discours Si elle y reussit elle fait pour un instant notre salut Pl    The Fall Out of Redemption Since the poet is a monster who attempts his salvation by the words and since he replaces the void of the universe with the very symbol of the void for is the word anything else than that  why would we not follow him in his exceptional il usion He becomes our recourse every time that we desert our fictions of ordinary language in order to seek others unusual if not rigorous Does it not seem then that all other unreality is preferable to ours and that there is more substance in a line of poetry than in all those words trivialized by our conversations or our prayers That our poetry must be accessible or hermetic effective or gratuitous is a secondary problem Exercise or revelation what does it matter We ask of it we others that it deliver us from oppression from the torments of discourse If it succeeds it makes for an instant our salvation It is significant that it is in the context of poetry that Cioran presents this crucial observation about redemption one to which we shall return in greater detail namely that if any redemption is available to us at al  it is as a temporary phenomenon By this conception of redemption Cioran distinguishes himself from the other writers we have been considering for whom presumably redemption is either permanent or nonexistent For now it is important to note that this redemption is not simply synonymous with il usion as for instance altered states of consciousness might be for others who hint at temporary redemption Rather this temporary redemption is linked specifical y and exclusively to language poets save us from the torments of discourse in ways that Cioran does not enumerate more specifical y here If we take into consideration the link between language and fiction we can begin to make the link between linguistic redemption and other modes Fictions we recal  are a kind of lucid il usion entirely constructed in and through language so the work of the poets though not in narrative form allows us to free existing words from their longestablished contexts in order not so much to remove ourselves from il usion as to reshape those il usions consciously Cioran goes so far as to equate our existence and our fictions Nous durons tant que durent nos fictions Exister equivaut a un acte de foi a une protestation contre la verite a une priere interminable Des lors qu ils consentent a vivre l incredule et le devot se ressemblent en profondeur puisque l un et autre ont pris la seule decision qui marque un etre Pl  We last as long as our fictions last Existing equals an act of faith a protest against the truth an interminable prayer  As soon as they consent to live the faithless person and the devout one resemble each other deeply since both have made the only decision that marks a being This passage while affirming what Cioran claims about the impossibility of perceiving the desired state of nothingness further highlights the impossibility of surpassing religious structures of thought even as we reject belief in a God The challenge then becomes escaping the logic of redemption while being forced to The Eternal Fall Cioran  remain inside the protoChristian structures of thought or action that is the gesture of living in the first place The production of il usion that we call living can be seen as either a heroic protest or a taking refuge in il usion But once again artistic creation and lived experience as creation are brought together as similar acts both stripped of their redemptive aspect at least in any permanent sense One specific literary mode of living the consequences of the unavailability of redemption is that of tragedy which allows us to see new meaning in a version of the story of Jesus stripped of the resurrection Si Jesus avait fini sa carriere sur la croix et qu il ne se fut pas engage a ressusciter quel beau heros de la tragedie Son cote divin a fait perdre a la litterature un admirable sujet Rien de plus etranger a la tragedie que l idee de redemption de salut et d immortalite If Jesus had finished his career on the cross and had not been engaged in rising from the dead what a beautiful tragic hero His divine side made literature lose an admirable subject Nothing more foreign to tragedy than the idea of redemption salvation and immortality Pl   Far from shutting down literary creation then the removal of salvation enables it while preserving the notion of salvation inhibits it To understand why it is helpful to turn to Paul Audi s notion of paradise in his theory of esthetics For Audi paradise is the conceptual space where everything is possible While this sounds inviting if everything is possible then everything is also virtual and nothing is actual qu au paradis tout soit possible cela signifie qu aucun possible n y est a soi Rien de cette virtualite pure de cette virtualite inentamee par une quelconque actualisation des possibles  rien qui releve de ce champ de possibilites ouvert au maximum n appartient a qui que ce soit C est ce qui explique que le peche l acte qui cause la chute  ce terme designant l assignation de soi a la finitude c estadire l assignation a soi d un ensemble reduit de possibles resulte de la possession  c estadire d une decision consistant a s appoprier un possible Audi  That everything be possible in paradise signifies that no possible belongs to itself there Nothing of this pure virtuality of this virtuality unaccomplished by whatever actualization of possibilities  nothing from that field of possibilities open to maximum belongs to anybody at al  That is what explains that sin the act that causes the fal  that term designating the assignation of the self to finitude that is the assignation to oneself of a reduced totality of possibles results from possession that is from a decision consisting of appropriating a possible for oneself The conceptual space of paradise which is the locus of redemption inhibits esthetic production on account of the inability to move from the virtual to the real or actual Au paradis non seulement tout est possible mais la possibilite est tout ce qu il y a In paradise not only is everything possible but possibility is all that there is   This move is a crucial one for beginning to understand the role of sin in Cioran  The Fall Out of Redemption and its relationship to creation both of the world and of art Audi s conception of sin is helpful because he removes it from its traditional Christian connotations as disobedience to divine law and puts it squarely within a human context while stil retaining the force of the original theological concept We are always already fallen and always already unable to be redeemed and this space of the real and unalterable is the world in which we operate And as we have seen operating is the next best thing to the impossible scenario of perceiving ourselves ceasing to exist altogether This constant commitment to action is what distinguishes us to our detriment from animals according to Cioran Loin de fuir la monotonie les animaux la recherchent et ce qu ils redoutent le plus c est de la voir cesser car elle ne cesse que pour etre remplacee par la peur cause de tout affairement L inaction est divine C est pourtant contre elle que l homme s est insurge Lui seul dans la nature est incapable de supporter la monotonie lui seul veut a tout prix que quelque chose arrive n importe quoi Par la il se montre indigne de son ancetre le besoin de nouveaute est le fait d un gorille fourvoye Pl  Far from fleeing monotony animals seek it out and what they fear the most is to see it end for it ceases only to be replaced by fear cause of all bustling activity Inaction is divine It is however against it that man has revolted Only he in nature is incapable of tolerating monotony only he wants at all cost for something anything to happen By that he proves himself unworthy of his ancestor the need for newness is the fact of a misled goril a Inoperativity is what the animals and the divinity have in common and it is precisely the zone that is impossible for humans to occupy in our position of opposition to both animals and divinities If we follow Audi s lead in associating the fal  and thus what has traditional y been labeled sin with our necessary relegation to the realm of the actual as opposed to the potential or virtual we have an atheistic yet theological account of the relation of sin to creation and of artistic creation to other kinds of lived praxis In order to be saved on this account we would need to be something other than human and a saved humanity would be a fundamental y altered humanity precisely on account of its entry into inoperativity Cioran lays out the basic foundation of his asoteriology already in the Precis de decomposition but he goes on to develop the idea of the fall more extensively in his middle period in La chute dans le temps The Fall into Time  in particular Now that we have sketched the reason why the theological is of utmost importance to Cioran even though he separates it from any quetson of actual traditional belief in God we can enter further into Cioran s recasting of original sin and the way it operates independently of any notion of Satan disobedience or potential cancel ation through redemptive sacrifice Cioran s opening move in La chute dans le temps draws upon the fundamental duality of the human person that had theorized earlier The Eternal Fall Cioran  Nous ne sommes reellement nousmemes que lorsque dresses en face de soi nous ne coincidons avec rien pas meme avec notre singularite La malediction qui nous accable pesait deja sur notre premier ancetre bien avant qu il se tournat vers l arbre de la connaissance Insatisfait de luimeme il l etait encore plus de Dieu qu il enviait sans en etre conscient il al ait le devenir grace aux bons offices du tentateur auxiliaire plutot qu auteur de sa ruine Pl  We are only truly ourselves when standing in front of ourselves we do not coincide with anything not even with our singularity The curse that weighs us down already weighed on our first ancestor well before he turned toward the tree of knowledge Unsatisfied with himself he was even more so with God whom he envied without being conscious of it he was going to become conscious thanks to the good services of the tempter auxiliary rather than author of his ruin From the start it is evident that Cioran retains only the general conceptual outlines of the story of the fall and posits an extremely unorthodox interpretation The first major departure from traditional interpretation is also a departure from Baudelaire s own take on the fal  equal y central to his thought and writing but derived from different initial assumptions Of particular note is that original sin predates the encounter at the Tree of Knowledge and is thus not the result of any temptation In this Cioran distinguished himself from Joseph de Maistre whom he identifies as an admirable thinker but from whom he like Baudelaire he takes his distance especial y around questions of original sin and redemption Cioran writes that de Maistre se trompe lorsqu il ramene le Peche a une trangression primitive a une faute immemoriale et concertee au lieu d y voir une tare un vice de nature il se trompe egalement quand apres avoir parle a juste titre d une maladie originelle  il l attribute a nos iniquites alors qu elle etait ainsi que le Peche inscrite dans notre essence meme dereglement primordial calamite affectant indifferemment le bon et le mechant le vertueux et le vicieux Pl  is mistaken when he traces Sin back to a primitive transgression to an immemorial and concerted fault rather than seeing in it a stain a vice of nature he is mistaken equal y when after having spoken rightly of an original malady he attributes it to our iniquities whereas it was as Sin was inscribed in our very essence primordial undoing calamity indifferently affecting the good and the bad the virtuous and the vicious Human duality is for Cioran unlike for de Maistre irredeemable Just as inoperativity is central to our definition as human beings so too is the inherent duality of the human person not so much in the sense of a tension between good and evil those terms are conspicuously absent here but in a distance from self that is constitutive of the human Knowledge of this duality is as it was also for Fondane the main consequence of this primal scene rather than disobedience to a divine command or  The Fall Out of Redemption even a rupture with an original wholeness It follows natural y from this interpretation that the devil is reduced to the role of accomplice an almost unnecessary figure rather than a central character in the drama In that sense Cioran s theology corresponds to JeanLuc Nancy s notion of the autodeconstruction of Christianity The resulting atheistic theology leaves the place of God open and empty and retains the force of a theological vision without an allpowerful God driving it According to Nancy God must necessarily disappear into the world at the moment of creation otherwise there would then be two worlds  and with this disappearance a decisive episode of the entire movemement that I have sometimes named the deconstruction of Christianity occurs which would be the integral absenting of God in the unity that reduces it in and where it dissolves Creation    Also crucial here is the emphasis on knowledge rather than eternal life as humanity s aspiration L homme ne demandait qu a mourir voulant egaler son Createur par le savoir non par l immortalite il n avait nul desir d approcher de l arbre de vie n y portait aucun interet c est ce dont Yahweh parut s aviser puisqu il ne lui en interdit meme pas l acces pourquoi craindre l immortalite d un ignorant Pl  Man asked only to die wanting to equal his Creator by knowledge not by immortality he had no desire to approach the tree of life was not at all interested in it that is what Yahweh seemed to realize since he did not even forbid him access to it why fear the immortality of one who does not know Cioran retains the notion of humanity s having been created in God s image but once again he reinterprets the meaning of that idea based on a nontraditional identification of the attributes of God for Cioran what we share with God is his inability to be happy En lui se manifestait deja cette inaptitude au bonheur cette incapacite de le supporter dont nous avons tous herite Qu attendre d autre d une carriere commencee par une infraction a la sagesse par une infidelite au don d ignorance que le Createur nous avait dispense In him manifested itself already that inaptitude for happiness that incapacity to tolerate it that we have all inherited What else to expect from a career begun by an infraction to wisdom by an infidelity to the gift of ignorance that the Creator had dispensed to us Pl   If humans are defined by their distance from themselves there is continuity with the notion of God here who in order to create needed to make something that would be differentiated from himself thus one could see the act of creation itself as a distancing of God from himself from a unity to a multiplicity of being Moreover we inherit our inability to be happy not from Adam but from God himself and thus by our very misery participate in the divine For God to save us from this condition would mean the ability of God to save himself as wel  a capacity clearly not in his power What God could not have done for himself he attempts to do for a humanity which then refuses the gift and by doing so defines itself as human The Eternal Fall Cioran  Cioran s idiosyncratic take on the fall sees it as double Traditionally the fall inaugurates historical time putting into motion the series of events that will culminate at the end of chronological time in the messianic event which cancels the fall into history Cioran acknowledges that fall but speaking in his quasi prophetic firstperson singular in a way that deindividualizes that speaking subject he asserts Les autres tombent dans le temps je suis moi tombe du temps A l eternite qui s erigeait audessus de lui succede cette autre qui se place audessous zone sterile ou l on n eprouve qu un seul desir reintegrer le temps s y elever coute que coute s en approprier une parcelle pour s y installer pour se donner l il usion d un chezsoi Mais le temps est clos mais le temps est hors d atteinte et c est de l impossibilite d y penetrer qu est faite cette eternite negative cette mauvaise eternite Pl   Others fall into time as for me I have fallen from time Following on that eternity that built itself up above him is that other history that places itself beneath in a sterile zone where one only feels one desire to reintegrate time to raise oneself in it whatever the costs to appropriate a parcel of it in order to install oneself there to give oneself the il usion of a home But time is closed off but time is beyond our grasp and it is from the impossibility of entering it that is made this negative eternity this bad eternity The second fal  the fall from time rather than correcting the effects of the first repeats them as Sylvie Jaudeau has remarked at another level since the second fall reproduces with regard to time the absolutist il usion of historical man with regard to the origin fallen man places paradise that he had formerly assimilated to eternity in the temporal universe Jaudeau   At the end of La chute dans le temps Cioran turns to the question of will in order to suggest that if lack of it is a sickness la volonte ellememe en est une autre pire encore will itself is another still worse one Pl   If man were to attain the status of Nietzsche s overman il eclaterait sans doute et s ecroulerait sur luimeme Et c est par un detour grandiose qu il serait amene alors a tomber du temps pour entrer dans l eternite d en bas terme ineluctable ou peu importe en fin de compte qu il arrive par deperissement ou par desastre he would doubtless explode and would crumble on himself And it is by a grandiose detour that he would thus be brought to fall from time to enter eternity from below ineluctable endpoint where it matters little final y whether he enters by wasting away or by disaster Pl   In place of the logic of slavation Cioran sets up a nowin situation whereby humanity is forced to choose between two kinds of annihilation the active one of history being the worse of the two options In this key passage Cioran definitively dismisses not only the Christian notion of redemption but also the modern philosophical echoes of it as well as the political incarnations inherent in any notion of progress  The Fall Out of Redemption Like Fondane Cioran places the desire to know at the heart of what he will characterize as original sin a view incompatible with the notion that happiness could derive from acting on that desire Le desir de connaitre empreint de perversite et de corruption plus il nous tient plus il nous rend incapables de demeurer a l interieur de quelque realite que ce soit Si l homme avait eu la moindre vocation pour l eternite au lieu de courir vers l inconnu vers le nouveau vers les ravages qu entraine l appetit d analyse il se fut contente de Dieu dans la familiarite duquel il prosperait Il aspira a s en emanciper a s en arracher et y a reussi audela de ses esperances Pl  The desire to know imprinted with perversity and corruption the more it holds us the more it renders us incapable of remaining on the inside of any reality at al  If man had had the least vocation for eternity instead of running toward the unknown toward the new toward the ravages that the appetite for analysis brings he would have contented himself with God in whose familiarity he was prospering He aspired to emancipate himself to tear himself away and succeeded beyond his hopes The sign that humanity was not cut out for eternity is ennui the emotional manifestation of the metaphysical fact of incompatibility of human restlessness and divine changelessness We recall that for Baudelaire satanic revolt is conceived as a potential point of exit from ennui albeit one that eventual y proves false For Cioran history itself plays an analogous role to Baudelaire s Satanism a fruitless temptation as a potential remedy to ennui L ennui au milieu du paradis fit naitre chez notre premier ancetre un appetit d abime qui nous a valu ce defile de siecles dont nous entrevoyons maintenant le terme Cet appetit veritable nostalgie de l enfer ne manquerait pas de ravager la race qui nous succederait et d en faire la digne heritiere de nos travers Ennui in the middle of paradise gave birth in our first ancestor to an appetite for the abyss which has gained us this parade of centuries of which we see the endpoint now This appetite a veritable nostalgia for hel  would not fail to ravage the race that would follow us and make it the worthy inheritor of our shortcomings Pl   Despite the shift in emphasis to history a pattern emerges in Cioran that is familiar from Baudelaire given that divine redemption is impossible we seek it in other channels but remain blind to the fact that our incontrovertible doubleness renders any potential redemption impossible Our being human has the consequence of revealing an aspiration to us while that aspiration must necessarily go unfulfilled On account of this we have the right to be envious even of an insect who easily attains what a human being cannot Ayant perdu le secret de la vie et emprunte un trop grand detour pour pouvoir le retrouver et reapprendre l etre humain s eloigne chaque jour un peu plus de son ancienne innocence il dechoit sans arret de l eternite Having lost the secret of life and taken an overly large detour in order to find it and learn it again the human being distances himself a little more each day from his former innocence he fal s away from eternity without stopping Pl   Similarly The Eternal Fall Cioran  rats are also superior to us Comment ne pas reconnaitre les avantages qu a sur nous un rat justement parce qu il est rat et rien d autre Toujours differents nous ne sommes nousmemes que dans la mesure ou nous nous ecartons de notre definition How can we not recognize the advantages that a rat has over us precisely because he is a rat and nothing else Aways different we are only ourselves to the extent that we separate ourselves from our definition Pl   If we are defined by duality that is if our singularity is itself doubled then we are condemned always to be at a distance from ourselves always looking to bridge a gap to arrive at a coherent view of self that is however permanently inaccessible to us precisely because closing the gap would eliminate our self as we have known it Etre conscient c est etre divise d avec soi c est se hair To be conscious is to be divided against oneself it is to hate oneself Pl   Cioran links this doubleness to our insatiable appetite for il usion the il usion that we have a unified self to which we could somehow have access feeds other il usions such as the improvement of ourselves which itself stems from the il usion of superiority that we feel toward other animals Obnubiles par la metamorphose par le possible par la grimace imminente de nousmemes nous accumulons de l irreel et nous nous dilatons dans le faux car des qu on se sait et qu on se sent homme on vise au gigantisme on veut paraitre plus grand que nature Obsessed by metamorphosis by the possible by the imminent grimace of ourselves we accumulate the unreal and we dilate ourselves in the false for as soon as one knows and feels oneself to be a man one aims at gigantism one wants to seem bigger than nature Pl   We should also note that Cioran here identifies the possible as the source of our perdition this is precisely the defining characteristic of paradise as Audi defined it When translated to the world however which is necessarily the realm of the actual as opposed to the virtual precisely because we cannot cease all movement and operativity the possible becomes a source of torment because we fall under the il usion that the possible is realizable when in fact there is a radical incompatibility between the possible and the actual The stakes are high if we fail to attain lucidity about the il usion of the possible Cioran is almost always concerned with describing things as they are rather than as they could or should be He does occasional y engage the level of the virtual and these moments help solidify the distinction between the possible and the actual or as we have just framed it the world of what we mught call paradise and the lived reality that opposes itself to it In yet another condemnation of humanity s engagement in history Cioran writes Au lieu de s evertuer a se retrouver a se rencontrer avec soi il a tourne ses facultes vers l exterieur vers l histoire Les eutil interiorisees en eutil modifie l exercice et la direction qu il eut reussi a assurer son salut Rather than striving to find himself again to meet up with himself he turned his faculties toward the exterior toward history Had he interiorized them had he modified their exercise and direction he would have succeeded in assuring his salvation Pl   At first glance this seems like an odd affirmation for a thinker like Cioran in that it seems to advocate a rich interior life as leading to a satisfying human experience as if we could be happier by being more reflective But in light of the tortures of the mind that result from any kind of contemplative  The Fall Out of Redemption activity Cioran could hardly affirm such a position all the less so in that it seems so easy to accomplish this turn from exteriority to interiority here Moreover the fact that Cioran situates knowledge at the heart of what he labels original sin suggests that acts of contemplation which would sink us even further into the heart of knowing indicates that Cioran would need to suggest that Cioran reject interiority as a route to salvation After al  the self only tortures itself by contemplating itself because that contemplation only reveals the self s irreparable doubleness as a constitutive property thus revealing that we get further from any desired unity of self the more we meditate on that condition which can only divide us further from ourselves The key here is in the hypothetical past of the last sentence that I ve quoted Given that Cioran simply cannot affirm that redemption was available to a humanity that refused it we need to read this hypothetical beyond the surface level Cioran cannot be suggesting that things could have been otherwise for humanity given the duality that constitutes humanity as distinct from the animals What he describes here then is pure virtuality the existence of a conceptual space where redemption would have been possible This space is what we can call paradise a place where everything is possible and therefore nothing is actual Would this then be redemption Yes and no since there would have been no condition from which we would have needed to be saved thus rendering the conceptual category of redemption inoperative If rendering salvation inoperative is indeed a kind of salvation it can only be in Agamben s sense of a virtuality a pure salvation that saves nothing because it is without object What is happening in this quoted passage then is that Cioran s writing becomes performative il ustrating the consequences of the fall as he characterizes it For the fact that the speaking subject here can imagine a virtual world where there would have been some kind of salvation suggests the irrepareable divide between what we can imagine and what we know to be reality in terms not only of our condemnation to irreparable duality but more importantly of our consciousness of that duality What the hypothetical mood indicates is the deep consequences of human knowledge as constitutive of the always already occurring fal  This idiosyncratic view of the fall is accompanied by an equal y idiosyncratic treatment of God and this is a key component of what separates Cioran s view of the fall from the traditional Christian reading of human sin as the refusal of God s offer of happiness Creation is for Cioran the work of an imperfect creator the mauvais demiurge evil demiurge it is more like a disaster resulting from the effort of an incompetent artisan It is not only humanity who fal s in his view but also God himself Thus Cioran shares the traditional view that we aspire to be like God but deforms it to suggest that we are in God s image not in our tendency toward good or perfection but rather in the disasters that result from our own imperfection En competition avec Dieu nous singeons ses cotes douteux son cote demiurge cette partie de lui qui l entraina a creer a concevoir une oeuvre qui devait l appauvrir le diminuer le precipiter dans une chute prefiguration de la notre L entreprise amorcee il nous laissa le soin de la parachever puis rentra en soi dans son eternelle apathie d ou il eut ete preferable qu il ne sortit jamais Ou nous The Eternal Fall Cioran  refugier sinon aupres de celui qui l episode de la creation mis a part fut toujours coupe de tout Nous aurions connu alors une autre face de la divinite et peutetre aujourd hui enveloppes d une lumiere pure non entachee de tenebres ni d aucun element diabolique serionsnous aussi incurieux et aussi exempts de la mort que le sots et les anges Pl  In competition with God we ape his dubious aspects his demiurgic aspect that part of him that brought him to create to conceive a work that had to impoverish him to diminish him to throw him into a fall prefiguration of ours Once the operation was begun he left us the responsibility to finish it then retreated into himself in his eternal apathy from which it would have been preferable that he never leave in the first place Where can we take refuge If not near him who with the exception of the episode of creation was always cut off from everything We would have known then another face of the divinity and maybe today wrapped in a pure light not sullied by darkness or any other diabolical element we would have been as uncurious and as exempt from death as idiots and angels Humans thus complete God s work on earth by continuing the disaster and catastrophe inaugurated by the creation in the first place and which we now cal history Our inability to remain within inaction is not the result of a decision but rather like our duality something inherent in our nature without which we would be something other than human but on account of which we share in the divine image since God also could apparently not refrain from action Given that this push into the action of creation is a departure from God s nature traditional y defined as eternal and inoperative and therefore changeless we see that God himself fal s when he creates the world yielding just as humans do to the temptation to act and thus reinforcing another link between humanity and divinity to the detriment of both Cioran s appeal to the gnostic concept of the demiurge helps him avoid some of the conceptual ambiguity that Baudelaire faced when attempting to uphold the duality of God and the devil While Cioran often adapts gnostic concepts rather than adopting them strictly as presented in the gnostic tradition itself the idea of a not necessarily benevolent and certainly not omnipotent demiurge allows Cioran to develop his notion of an imperfect and irredeemable universe Cioran is not so much attempting to provide a perverse reading as to draw all of the consequences from the givens of the Christian myth of the origins of creation and humanity He himself evokes the notion of considering all the consequences of one s foundations Si l homme n est pas pres d abdiquer ou de reconsiderer son cas c est qui il n a pas encore tire les dernieres consequences du savoir et du pouvoir If man is not ready to abdicate or reconsider his case it is that he has not yet drawn the last consequences from knowing and power Pl   While Cioran puts aside questions of belief his project in books such as La chute dans le temps and Le mauvais demiurge is not to reject the fundamental tenets of Christianity but to try to draw the proper conclusions from them working from within Christian theological logic to arrive at conclusions that differ widely and Cioran would claim necessarily from those that  The Fall Out of Redemption Christian theology draws and most notably around the ideas of God s goodness and perfection and the possibility of redemption In his middle period books as in his earlier ones Cioran maintains the impossibility of salvation but does not cease returning to the idea in a haunting that suggests that one cannot be rid of the notion of salvation merely by affirming and arguing for its impossibility In La chute dans le temps he makes a distinction between salvation and deliverance Detache de ses entreprises  le sceptique est arrive a la delivrance mais a une delivrance sans salut prelude a l experience integrale de la vacuite dont il approche tout a fait lorsque apres avoir doute de ses doutes il finit par douter de soi par se deprecier et se hair par ne plus croire a sa mission de destructeur Une fois rompu le dernier lien celui qui le rattachit a soi et faute duquel l autodestruction meme est impossible il cherchera refuge dans la vacance primordiale  Son incurosite atteint a une telle ampleur qu elle confine au depouillement total a un neant plus denude que celui dont les mystiques s enorgueillissent ou se plaignent apres leurs peregrinations a travers le desert de la divinite Pl  Detatched from his undertakings  the skeptic has arrived at deliverance but at a deliverance without salvation prelude to the full experience of vacuousness which he approaches entirely when after having doubted his doubts he ends up doubting himself deprecating and hating himself no longer believing in his mission of being a destroyer Once the last link is broken the one that attached him to himself and without which even selfdestruction is impossible he will seek refuge in the primordial vacancy  His uncurosity attains such large size that it confines to total deprivation to a more naked nothingness than the one which the mystics were so proud of or complained about after their peregrinations through the desert of the divinity This is at first glance an unexpected line of thought from Cioran in that it speaks of deliverance not as an unfulfil able hypothetical but as an accomplished reality as well as referring to self hatred not as a sense of torture resulting from the inevitable doubling of the self but rather as a positive move in the direction of breaking the ties that block us from deliverance There is a creative destruction of the self here We seem to witness the transformation of the human being into what Cioran often considers impossible namely a creature that can experience the vacance primordiale that would be a form of deliverance Baudelaire s impossible neant appears accessible in this passage but we must recall that ultimately for Cioran this can only be a temporary condition for reasons that have to do with the act of knowing which is tellingly absent from this passage Maintaining the state of the neant here would involve a permanent refusal of consciousness and once again we return to the problem of knowledge as it presents itself for Cioran namely that deliverance would involve surpassing knowledge but that such a condition would render us something other than human What Cioran describes is something aligned with mystical experience and even superior to it as he The Eternal Fall Cioran  suggests at the end of the passage  but like mystical experience it is rare and certainly not able to be prolonged Moreover any awareness of this state of deliverance would already be a step away from it since knowledge is a characteristic of the divided self that the neant was intended to conquer The deliverancewithoutsalvation that Cioran describes here is similar to other moments connected especial y with writing where Cioran affirms something like redemption but only in the mode of the temporary thus negating one of redemption s essential features its eternity and its removal of the saved subject from the changes of temporality Cioran makes a similar move when considering what kind of relief might be available to us from the torturous thoughts that he pursues throughout most of his works S il nous est interdit de recouvrer l innocence primordiale en revanche nous pouvons en imaginer une autre et essayer d y acceder grace a un savoir depourvu de perversite purifie de ses tares change en profondeur repenti  Une telle metamorphose equivaudrait a la conquete d une seconde innocence laquelle survenue apres des millenaires de doute et de lucidite aurait sur la premiere l avantage de ne plus se laisser prendre aux prestiges maintenant uses du Serpent La disjonction entre science et chute une fois operee l acte de connaitre ne flattant plus la vanite de personne aucun plaisir demoniaque n accompagnerait encore l indiscretion forcement agressive de l esprit Il s agirait ni plus ni moins que de recommencer la Connaissance c estadire d edifier une autre histoire une histoire degrevee de l ancienne malediction et ou il nous fut donne de retrouver cette marque divine que nous portons avant la rupture avec le reste de la creation Nous ne pouvons vivre avec le sentiment d une faute totale  Comme c est notre corruption qui nous fait sortir de nousmemes l empressement a produire nous denonce nous accuse Si nos oeuvres temoignent contre nous n estce point parce qu elles emanent du besoin de camoufler notre decheance de tromper autrui et plus encore de nous tromper nousmemes Le faire est entache d un vice original dont l etre semble exempt Et pusique tout ce que nous accomplissons procede de la perte de l innocence ce n est que par le desaveu de nos actes et le degout de nous memes que nous pouvons nous racheter Pl  If we are forbidden from recovering primordial innocence in return we can imagine another one and try to access it thanks to a knowledge deprived of perversity purified of its stains deeply changed repented Such a metamorphosis would be equivalent to the conquest of a second innocence which arrived after thousands of years of doubt and lucidity would have the advantage over the first one of no longer letting itself fall victim to the glamour now faded of the Serpent Once the disjunction between science and the fall is accomplished the act of knowing no longer flattering the vanity of anyone no demonic pleasure would still accompany the inevitably aggressive indiscretion of the mind It would be a question no more and no less of recommencing Knowledge that is to build  The Fall Out of Redemption another history a history disencumbered of the former curse and where it would be given to us to find again that divine sign that we wore before the rupture with the rest of creation We cannot live with the feeling of a total fault  Since it is our corruption that made us go out of ourselves the rush to produce denounces us and accuses us If our works testify against us is it not because they emanate from the need to camouflage our decay to fool others and moreover to fool ourselves Doing is sullied with an original vice of which being seems exempt And since everything we accomplish proceeds from the loss of innocence it is only by disavowing our acts and our disgust at ourselves that we can redeem ourselves Once again as the passage continues it reveals the impossibility of what it seems to affirm at the outset The key to gaining access to the second innocence to which Cioran initial y refers is the overcoming of production which would need to be dissociated from knowledge in order to make the latter palatable While Cioran does not say so directly however such a reduction of production and its original vice is impossible since the refusal of all doing or making would place us in the domain of inoperativity In other words what at first seems to be a major alteration in Cioran s position on the possibility of redemption turns out to be yet another instance of the thought of redemption haunting the thinker without an actual possibility of it emerging from the thought It is as if by writing this passage Cioran were enacting the impossibility of redemption the sheer fact of producing the passage reveals a reversion to the state of making which is precisely the logic one would need to transcend in order to begin to think about a new state of innocence And once again Cioran flirts with traditional theological concepts while radical y altering them if for traditional theology humans participate in God s nature and action through their own creativity for Cioran our creative acts do indeed align us with God but only to demonstrate God s participation in the fall as wel  For Cioran the medium is never separate from the message He never claims to be making systematic philosophical arguments in fact he actively resists such an approach His writings also betray a keen interest in stylistic perfection which suggests that he crafts his thoughts with an eye to their esthetic status Although his work often resists classification it is possible to analyze the firstperson speaking voice as well as the progression or lack thereof from aphorism to aphorism as they exist in dialogue or contradiction This suggests that we should consider Cioran s writings within the domain of the broadly literary that is in a genre that while not opposed to exploring nonfictional truths would not have truth in a conventional philosophical sense as a main goal Rather the truth produced by literary works is situational provisional and dynamic In this sense Cioran is strongly invested in what we could call fiction as long as we understand that term not as the opposite of truth or the synonym of fakery or falsehood but rather as a creative in the strong sense use of language that bears a complex relationship to il usion truth and lucidity The confident way in which Cioran presents his ideas about the fall and its consequences clashes with his frequent affirmation of skepticism and doubt as the only appropriate reactions to any solidly formed and confidently expressed ideas The Eternal Fall Cioran  There is of course an element of paradox necessarily built into any consistently skeptical position since eventual y one would have to be skeptical of one s own skepticism but here the concept of fiction as a contextbound situational and provisional kind of truth can be helpful Two excerpts from Cioran s Cahiers written five years apart reveal the way he comes to nuance his confidenceladen propositions In  Cioran pens this short aphorism defining himself by his superior level of lucidity Qui etesvous Je suis le Detrompe Who are you I am the one without il usions C   In  the statement is both elaborated and nuanced Chacun sa demence la mienne est de me croire l homme le plus detrompe qui fut jamais L exces de cette pretention en prouve l irrealite N empeche que parfois j ai la sensation que personne n est ni ne pourra etre moins dupe que je ne l ai ete a certains moments a certains moments seulement Car tout est chez moi occurrence date instant sensation precisement C   To each his madness mine is to believe myself the man most devoid of il usions that ever was The excess of this pretention proves its irreality Nevertheless sometimes I have the sensation that no one is and no one could be less duped than I was at certain moments and only at certain moments For everything in my case is occurrence date instant sensation precisely The expanded and altered version is instructive both about what Cioran means by lucidity and about the nature of his aphorisms more general y In it he recognizes the potential y fictional quality of his assertion about his own lucidity thus keeping open the possibility that his conviction about lucidity may in fact be an il usion and suggesting that we should read that assertion of lucidity as a kind of productive il usion The statement is fictional in that it allows him to speak as a character from within the perspective of supposed lucidity to bracket doubt for long enough to be able to craft an enunciation from within that point of view In this way he temporarily suspends but never ful y transcends the skepticism that lies at the base of all of his positions Furthermore he alters the enunciation in a quasiKantian way by claiming that he appears to himself as free of il usion and that this is as far as we can go on the way to ultimate knowledge His assertion is openended not in the sense of allowing for a nearinfinite number of potential interpretations but rather in the sense of being provisional and thus allowing him to assert a contradictory claim at a different instant This revealing glance into the workshop of the aphorist sheds light on the way in which we should read the kinds of categorical statements that frequently appear in his collections of aphorisms in forms similar to the one he provides in the shorter version of the aphorism we are considering The expanded version does not cancel or falsify the shorter one so much as providing a key to its interpretation one which emphasizes the situational aspect of a character speaking in a given way at a given time even though that time and situation are never of course explicitly specified The impression that the speaker is speaking from a vantage point of nowhere and at no particular moment is of course an important part of the fiction  The Fall Out of Redemption A crucial aspect of fiction as Cioran writes it is that it is a fertile kind of il usion the certainty of absolute ludicity would shut down creative production since there would be nothing to add to the articulation of a ful y lucid and definitive position Such a writer would be caught in the trap of an eternal repetition of the same idea in exactly the same words thus our fall into language in its multiplicity and imperfection as a mode of transparent communicability is also that which engenders literary production Even if we affirm with Cioran that plant or animal existence or especial y nonexistence would be preferable to human existence as we are condemned to experience it creative production has a role to play in making that experience more livable Suspending ludicity long enough to enter a kind of il usion that allows for creative fertility does not exactly mire us deeper in the evil of existing since barely anything could mire us more deeply than we already are We might be tempted at this point to see writing conceived along these lines as a kind of redemptive act but we must guard against that temptation or at least significantly qualify it Living requires the kinds of il usions that block our ability truly to conceive that nothing real y exists By definition for Cioran what we call life depends on il usion Et comme l homme avance en vertu de l il usion acquise pour s arreter il faudrait que l il usion s effritat et disparut mais elle est indestructible tant qu il demeure complice du temps And as man avances according to the amount of il usion acquired to stop it would be necessary for il usion to evaporate and disappear but it is indestructible as long as man is complicit with time Pl   All of this comes round once again to the notion of the fal  specifical y the fall into time from which there can be no release And so we continue to fall both into time and into religious conceptions even though we know them to be il usions thus guaranteeing that we can never be saved by refusing to maintain the importance of being saved in the first place The vestiges of religious thinking in Cioran s writing are some of the il usions beyond which we find it hard to think and live for a sustained period of time the atheist is no less delusional than the believer since both require fictions to sustain life And so if living means believing in fiction then making the affirmation that we are saved when we understand that nothing is would involve renouncing the very skepticism that led us here since as Cioran writes in De l inconvenient d etre ne in a passage quoted above La certitude qu il n y a pas de salut est une forme de salut elle est meme le salut a partir de la on peut aussi bien organiser sa propre vie que construire une philosophie de l histoire The certainty that there is no salvation is a form of salvation it is even salvation itself From there one can organize one s own life as well as construct a philosophy of history Pl   To be able to follow these lines of thinking simultaneously we would need to adopt both absolute skepticism and absolute certainty This would be salvation but here once again its conditions of existence are shown to be logical y impossible Given that an acknowledgment of the nullity of existence along with a concurrent reduction in all of the faculties typically associated with human nature are what would bring us closest to something like salvation it is not surprising that Cioran affirms the value of sleep as a potential relief from the suffering that characterizes existence The Eternal Fall Cioran  N importe qui se sauve par le sommeil n importe qui a du genie en dormant point de difference entre les reves d un boucher et ceux d un poete Mais notre clairvoyance ne saurait tolerer qu une telle merveille dure ni que l inspiration soit mise a la portee de tous le jour nous retire les dons que la nuit nous dispense Le fou seul possede le privilege de passer sans heurt de l existence nocturne l existence diurne aucune distinction entre ses reves et ses veilles Il a renonce a notre raison comme le clochard a nos biens Tous deux ont trouve la voie qui mene hors de la souffrance et resolu tous nos problemes aussi demeurentils des modeles que nous ne pouvons suivre des sauveurs sans adeptes Pl  Anyone saves himself or escapes by sleep anyone is a genius while sleeping no difference between the dreams of a butcher and of a poet But our clairvoyance would not tolerate that such a miracle would last nor that inspiration be put at the disposal of all the day takes away from us the gifts that the night gives us Only the crazy man possesses the privilege of passing without a bump from nocturnal to diurnal existence no distinction between his dreams and his waking state He has renounced our reason as the bum has renounced our goods Both have found the way that leads beyond suffering and resolved all our problems thus they remain models that we can follow of saviors without followers From this it emerges that salvation is absolutely individual since a person cannot follow someone else into insanity as well as involuntary and thus impossible by sheer act of will alone not to mention undesirable for us as long as we cling to such inherently human tendencies as to believe that being sane is preferable to being insane Stil  sleep provides at least temporary or provisional salvation since in sleep we have a taste of what the unconscious void is like Sleep is the state that most resembles vegetal existence Plantes et betes portent sur elles les marques du salut comme l homme celles de la perdition Plants and animals bear on themselves the marks of salvation as man bears those of perdition Pl   Once again the fall into time is related to our permanent damnation on account of the fact that we are perpetual y changing not just in the sense of growing older which we share with the animals but in our ability to imagine the future and thus imagine humanity differently But what then of the act of creation itself If sleep brings us a step closer to animal consciousness then our active building and creating brings us nearer to God s work Predictably movement closer to God is not positively valued in Cioran De quoi sommesnous coupables sinon d avoir suivi plus ou moins servilement l exemple du createur Of what are we guilty if not of having followed more or less slavishly the example of the creator Pl   Cioran condemns parenthood by the same logic Cette incapacite de demeurer en soimeme dont le createur devait faire une si facheuse demonstration nous en avons tous herite engendrer c est continuer d une autre facon et a une autre echelle l entreprise qui porte son nom c est par une deplorable singerie ajouter a sa creation This incapacity to remain in oneself of which the creator had to make such a regrettable demonstration we have all inherited it to have offspring is to continue by other means and on another  The Fall Out of Redemption scale the enterprise that bears his name it is by a deplorable imitation to add to his creation Pl    But we are in far more complex territory once we discuss not human creation in general but artistic creation specifical y and more precisely stil  the act of writing In a sense Cioran s comments on the subject follow the same general trajectory that we saw operating in the case of redemption itself namely he at times provides the blanket condemnation of the idea that one would expect yet that condemnation is nuanced and even called completely into question by many of his other writings An eminently human activity writing is by its nature associated with the fall and with original sin according to Cioran Ecrire des livres n est pas sans avoir quelque rapport avec le peche originel Car qu estce qu un livre sinon une perte d innocence un acte d agression une repetition de notre chute Publier ses tares pour amuser ou exasperer Une barbarie a l egard de notre intimite une profanation une souil ure Et une tentation Je vous en parle en connaissance de cause Pl  Writing books is not without some relationship to original sin For what is a book if not a loss of innocence an act of aggression a repetition of our fall Publishing one s defects in order to amuse or exasperate An act of barbarism toward our intimacy a profanation a sul ying And a temptation I speak from personal experience Writing on this account draws us ever deeper into original sin rather than providing a way out of it which is consistent with Cioran s appraisal of all human pursuits Like living itself writing requires a large dose of il usion in order to sustain itself Produire creer  c est s interdire la clairvoyance c est avoir le courage ou le bonheur de ne pas percevoir le mensonge de la diversite le caractere trompeur du multiple Une oeuvre n est realisable que si nous nous aveuglons sur les apparences des que nous cessons de leur attribuer une dimension metaphysique nous perdons tous nos moyens Pl  To produce to create is to forbid oneself clearsightedness it is to have the courage or the happiness to not notice the lie of diversity the deceiving character of the multiple A work is only achievable is we blind ourselves to appearances as soon as we cease to attribute a metaphysical dimension to them we lose all our means But here a very different note emerges in the words courage and bonheur Unlike other proposed sources of redemption which ultimately draw us ever deeper into perdition writing seems to hold out hope for something more If it requires just as much delusion about our condition as the other solutions the difference seems to be the lucidity with which the writer undertakes the delusion that leads to the possibility The Eternal Fall Cioran  of writing  The delusion is controlled by the writer rather than encroaching upon him or her unwittingly Writing thereby becomes a means of confronting even if not vanquishing the il usions inherent in human life and therefore requires courage temporarily to enter those il usions so as better to il uminate and give voice to them This is perhaps the appropriate degree of involvement in the human condition this act of giving voice to it without drawing the full consequences of that condition Ne tirent les dernieres consequences que ceux qui vivent hors de l art Le suicide la saintete le vice autant de formes du manque de talent C est une diminution salutaire qui fait de tout acte de creation un facteur de fuite Only those who live outside of art draw the last consequences Suicide holiness vice so many forms of lack of talent It s a saving diminution that makes of each act of creation a factor of evasion Pl   Passing into action to any greater extent than writing would be to fall into the same trap we explored above that of not canceling but merely adding to the fall of humanity by seeking to overcome it through an action like suicide which by permanently suspending existence permanently cancels lucidity without having changed the fallen human condition at al  The creative act when applied to words escapes the condemnation of action that Cioran applies almost universal y elsewhere Writing situates itself halfway between the continuation of il usion and the working through of lucidity it is neither one in any complete sense and participates simultaneously in both It is the kind of paradoxical act that can respond to the series of paradoxes that Cioran s tortured thinking about redemption has generated at every turn  Is this not however too easy a solution to a problem the complexity which Cioran has underscored throughout all the writings we have quoted One would be tempted to think so but the key aspect of this solution which does not allow for redemption by a simple substitution of one kind of il usion for another is in Cioran s indication with his own italics that poetry fait pour un instant notre salut makes for an instant our salvation Pl   By abandoning the notion of permanence we are able to achieve a temporary form of salvation which is in constant need of renewal Since we are condemned to exist in time and since changeless eternity is impossible humanity s constant falling can only be lessened by constant renewal of redemption the time of voluntary suspension of il usion through writing From this constantly renewed redemption stems the cyclic nature of Cioran s own writings which often refusing linear development turn around the same sets of ideas from aphorism to aphorism and from book to book Cioran himself links his obsessional rewriting of key ideas to a notion of writing as therapy Si je n ai fait qu ecrire le meme livre en marge des memes obsessions c est pour avoir constate que cela me liberait en quelque sorte J ai vraiment ecrit par necessite La litterature la philosophie que saisje encore ne furent pour moi qu un pretexte L acte d ecrire comme therapeutique c etait cela l essentiel If I have only written the same book over and over again  in the margins of the same obsessions it is because I noticed that it liberated me in some way I truly wrote by necessity Literature philosophy or whatever were only a pretext for me The act of writing as therapeutic that was the essential thing Liiceanu   Here Cioran s theology aligns itself perfectly with his attitude on writing he explicitly affirms both a  The Fall Out of Redemption provisional theological salvation and the momentary personal salvation available to us through poetry that he affirmed in the passage quoted above Il en est de la delivrance comme du salut chretien tel theologien dans sa scandaleuse naivete croit a la redemption tout en niant le peche originel mais si le peche n est pas consubstantiel a l humanite quel sens attribuer a l avenement du redempteur qu estce qu il est venu redimer Aucunement accidentelle notre corruption est permanente elle est de toujours De meme l iniquite elle est meme ce qu il a de plus visible icibas ou remettre les choses en place exigerait un sauveur pour chaque generation pour chaque individu plutot Pl  It is in the case of deliverance as in the case of Christian salvation one theologian in his scandalous naivete believes in redemption while denying original sin but if sin is not consubstantial with humanity what meaning can we attribute to the coming of the redeemer what did he come to redeem In no way accidental our corruption is permanent it has always been The same with iniquity it is even what is most visible here below where to put things back in their place would demand a savior for each generation or rather for each individual This individual savior which is in fact each person for him or herself is also a provisional savior Cioran remarks a few pages further on Dans la decision de renoncer au salut il n entre aucun element diabolique car s il en etait ainsi d ou viendrait la serenite qui accompagne cette decision Rien de diabolique ne rend serein Dans les parages du Demon on est au contraire morose C est mon cas Aussi ma serenite estelle de courte duree juste le temps de me decider a en finir avec le salut Par bonheur je m y decide souvent et chaque fois quelle paix Pl  No diabolical element enters into the decision to renounce salvation for if it were thus from whence would come the serenity that accompanies this decision Nothing diabolical renders one serene In the vicinity of the Demon one is on the contrary morose That s my case  Therefore my serenity is shortlasting just the time to make up my mind to be done with salvation Happily I decide that often and each time what peace And so both the need for salvation and the constantly renewable decision to renounce salvation are provisional Serenity is not impossible for Cioran it comes both through writing and the conscious decision to renounce salvation and perhaps the two acts function interdependently  But the essential point is that serenity comes only with the realization that there can be no permanent salvation and that while it is in constant need of renewal it is all the same perpetual y renewable by a further act of writing or a renewed commitment to renounce the need for salvation in the first place The Eternal Fall Cioran  A number of commentators on Cioran have focused on the role of writing Rachel Mutin has emphasized the palliative aspect that as we have seen above Cioran himself sometimes evokes Mutin writes A cathartic gesture which permits him to channel his anguishes his rages his hauntings and obsessions the fact of writing was thus for Cioran a means of delivering himself of expurging himself from a nearly intolerable interior overflowing Thus it is very probably in writing that Cioran found a palliative resolution  that of a nostalgic retreat imagined at the end of his life to come back to a sort of cynical world to arrive at a sumptuous decadence Mutin  Even in this emphasis on the therapeutic value of writing Mutin appeals to the vocabulary of redemption to describe the effect of writing which leads us to suspect that there is more to the role of writing in Cioran despite what he himself occasional y affirms than a simple pharmaceutical aspect a pure descent into il usion Other critics have emphasized the theological dimension of writing its characterization as a fall and thus as concomitant with our fall into time and into the degraded state which is the only possible human existence Cioran does not forgive himself for continuing to write Only silence is grand He is of the race of those who well aware of that cannot for all that renounce the word and the written word especial y Cioran the hopeless is a man of letters a contradiction that to which he was sensitive A new occasion to mock himself with a snicker that is not without indulgence Mauriac  Claude Mauriac s descriptive vocabulary accurately reflects the relation between writing and the fal  If as we have seen Cioran refuses to assign a diabolical motive to the decision to renounce redemption there is something that relates writing to our fallen condition Condemned to language just as we are condemned to exist in time unable thus to perpetuate silence the palliative measure which is writing is also a sign of our further falling As Mauriac emphasizes however Cioran is himself conscious of the fal  which to some extent mitigates its effects allowing a kind of lucidityin il usion through ironic detachment Cioran in fact claims that condensing language into aphorisms is a way of taming language s inevitable expansion Il est plus aise de renoncer au pain qu au verbe Malheureusement le verbe glisse au verbiage a la litterature Meme la pensee y tend toujours prete a se repandre a s enfler l arreter par la pointe la contracter en aphorisme ou en boutade c est s opposer a son expansion a son mouvement naturel a son elan vers le delayage ver l inflation Vous diraije le fond de ma pensee Tout mot est un mot de trop Il s agit pourtant d ecrire ecrivons  duponsnous les uns les autres Pl  It is easier to renounce bread than the word Unfortunately the word slides into verbiage into literature Even thought tends toward that always ready to spread  The Fall Out of Redemption itself out to puff itself out to stop it at the stinging point to contract it into an aphorism or a witty saying is to oppose its expansion its natural movement its movement toward padding out and inflation  Shall I tell you the depth of my thought Every word is one word too many The thing is to write though let us write  let us dupe each other Even though we are forever condemned this does not cancel all interest in life as Mauriac s phrase a parcel of attachment aptly conveys We get the sense that it is not simply as Cioran sometimes postulates that an inability permanently to renounce life is a mark of our complicity with the fall but rather an affirmation however provisional temporary and always open to skeptical interrogation that writing can and does form a real attachment to life and allows us to take some degree of momentary but deep pleasure from it Here it is important to make a distinction between pessimism and nihilism for while Cioran may sometimes be considered a nihilist and while many of the assertions we have quoted would give partial credence to this view in that he repeatedly affirms that nothing would be better than something nonexistence better than existence the role that writing plays for Cioran would suggest that pessimism is a more helpful perspective through which to consider his writings In his study of pessimism which argues in sympathy with Cioran that it arises as a reaction to modern linear notions of time and its implications about progress Joshua Foa Dienstag characterizes the difference this way Pessimism expects nothing But this is not nihilism Nihilism would be not wanting anything Extreme nihilism Wanting nothing Dienstag   In other words pessimism provides a potential art of living ful y lucid about the dissonance and disorder of the world Dienstag xii and therefore able to find joy by tempering expectations  It is not prohibited for the pessimist as it would be for the nihilist to believe that something may at least temporarily make life worth living Cioran s earliest readers in French already saw this attitude emerging through his brutal y pessimistic prose Maurice Nadeau s review of Precis de decomposition original y published in Combat in  notes that Cioran s act of writing removes him from nihilism On the side of the triumphal way that leads to atomic destruction he puts down his bag and sits exhausted refusing all consolations and all pity He still believes in something since he writes confesses and sings his distress Because he modulates it in a language that is all the more admirable since it is a borrowed one because he distributes it artistical y in lyrical phrasings some easily oratorical others of a concision like that of Nietzsche or Pascal will we have the effrontery to say that this distress is feigned Nadeau  While it cannot redeem us eternal y and while it may not even hold up to skeptical inquiry writing remains for Cioran as necessary as living he called it in his last published book a defendable il usion  Writing is never innocent nor are the subjects of its pronouncements fixed or permanent they are rather always subject to The Eternal Fall Cioran  revision or even to perpetual restatement of the same But lucidity about what writing can or cannot do as therapy theology or art of living while it is not a definitive mode of redemption is at least the beginning of the way to talk about it in terms that respect and reflect the full complexity of the idea If we are unable even in a posttheological age to get beyond our attachment to the concept of redemption writing lucidly about that failed attempt might just be the next best thing  Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy In La chute dans le temps Cioran writes Qui a fait une experience analogue a celle de l Ecclesiaste s en souviendra toujours les severites qu il y aura puisees sont irrefutables autant qu impraticables des banalites des evidences destructrices d equilibre des lieux communs qui rendent fou The one who has had an experience analogous to the one of the author of Ecclesiastes will remember forever the severities that he will have drawn from it are as irrefutable as they are impracticable banalties obvious observations that destroy balance commonplaces that make you crazy Pl   In a way this observation informs all of his writing which poses questions of how to continue living and how most appropriately to live in the world given the Cioranian subject s lucidity about the vanity of existence Despair and insanity are two risks associated with this point of view temporary escape via literature is as we have already seen another Disregard for others in recognition of the ethical relation as yet another form of absurdity and banality is also a potential temptation and yet Cioran s writings do not advocate such disregard or the abolition of ethical obligations How then does Cioran s thought and that of Baudelaire and others who could potential y carry the label nihilist move from the low point of despair suggested by the experience Cioran describes above which permeates all aspects of existence and is irreversible to the possibility of carrying on living It is at this point that the temptation to revert to a logic of redemption is greatest since the role of the messiah or social utopias or transfiguration via art has typical y been to cancel despair when nothing else can This reversion is what Leo Bersani has criticized in what he cal s the culture of redemption a crucial assumption of which is that a certain type of repetition of experience in art repairs inherently damaged or valueless experience Experience may be overhwleming practical y impossible to absorb but it is assumed that the work of art has the authority to master the presumed raw material of experience in a manner that uniquely gives value to perhaps even redeems that material   Far from falling into the tempting comforts of salvational logic however Baudelaire and Cioran point the way toward remaining within the experience Cioran describes here and becoming able to dwell there  All of the writers I have considered in this study pose the question of how to move from an esthetics to an ethics or rather how the two coexist Nicole Parfait claims that what Cioran presents is an esthetics under the guise of a moral philosophy   whereas Patrice Bollon cal s Cioran s thought an evolutionary art of living without dogmas a way of accustoming oneself to the world and to oneself of filling what  The Fall Out of Redemption Pavese called the profession of living an ethics   For Baudelaire and Cioran both esthetics and ethics ultimately stem from the notion of original sin but this is not to say that the idea provides a facile solution Cioran himself comments Comme toutes les grandes idees celle de la Chute rend compte de tout et de rien et il est tout aussi difficile de s en servir que de s en passer Mais enfin qu elle soit imputable a une faute ou a une fatalite a un acte d ordre moral ou a un principe metaphysique il demeure qu elle explique tout au moins en partie nos errements notre inaboutissement nos infructueuses recherches la terrible singularite des etres le role du perturbateur d animal detraque et inventif qui fut departi a chacun de nous Pl  Like all grand ideas the Fall accounts for everything and nothing and it is as difficult to use it as it is to do without it But final y whether it is imputable to a fault or a fatality to an act from the moral order or to a metaphysical principle it remains that it explains at least in part our wanderings our not arriving our unfruitful searches the terrible singularity of beings the role of the troublemaker the insane and inventive animal that was accorded to each of us When he suggests that original sin is so total an explanation as to not real y account for anything at al  Cioran makes clear the distance between his view and orthodox theological approaches to sin The explicative value of the fall lies not in its actual truth but rather in its ability to serve as a generating principle for both esthetic creation and ethical relations Like Baudelaire Cioran recognizes the power and one could even say the seduction of the fall as an explicative tale but guards against seeing esthetic creation as redeeming that fal  If anything esthetic creation comes to depend on the fall as its condition of possibility rather than canceling it Paul Audi develops what he cal s an esth etique a convergence of ethics and esthetics that lays particular emphasis on the kind of despair Cioran evokes in the passage quoted above  Audi writes Pour ne plus desesperer de son propre desespoir il faut precisement desesperer de lui Tel est le paradoxe sur lequel repose ce que j appelle la condition ethique Ce paradoxe veut que ce soit du trefonds du desespoir et pas du tout en s efforcant de se derober a son emprise fatale que ce soit de la desesperance meme que l esprit vienne a emerger pour le meilleur comme pour le pire et cela tant et si bien que cet esprit apparait inevitablement comme quelque chose sinon de desesperant du moins de desespere ce qui explique d ailleurs qu au fond de toute pensee  si jubilante soitelle pour ne pas dire au fond de tout acte futil un acte de creation il y a toujours une voix qui murmure sourdement comme elle fit aux oreilles de Tolstoi A quoi bon ou Et puis apres  In order not to despair over one s own despair one must precisely despair of it Such is the paradox on which rests what I call the ethical condition This paradox Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  desires that it be from the depths of despair and not at all in trying to shy away from its fatal hold that it be from despairing itself that the mind comes to emerge for better and for the worse and all the more so since this spirit appears inevitably as something if not despairing at least despaired which explains besides that at the bottom of all thought as jubilant as it may be not to mention at the bottom of every act even if it be an act of creation there is always a voice that murmurs quietly as it did in Tolstoy s ears what s the use or and then after that Here then is the beginning of an ethics that emerges from nihilism but remains within that nihilism rather than transcending it finding within it the basis for an art de vivre I will argue that if the main theoretical basis of asoteriology is established in Baudelaire s verse poems and Cioran s essays it is primarily in Baudelaire s prose poems that we see emerge a sketch of what an ethics based on asoteriology might look like We have already considered how the aphorism places itself outside the usual sequence of diachronic time Jacques Derrida sees in the unique temporality of the aphorism not a generalized removal from time but rather an affirmation of an immediate present that inevitably produces an ethical relation No aphorism without the promise of a now in common without the pledge the vow of synchrony the desired sharing of a living present In order that the sharing may be desired must it not first be given glimpsed apprehended But this sharing is just another name for aphorism Acts   Here Derrida navigates complex territory in terms of what is desired as opposed to what is actualized through the aphorism his language is not without echoes of the notion of the messianic that would place us back within soteriological thinking promises pledges and vows suggest what is to come perhaps forever deferred  But the notion of givenness here suggests that the relation is already posited by the writing itself in the immediate present as opposed to the future Derrida goes on to say Because it traces aphorism lives on it lives much longer than its present and it lives longer than life Death sentence arret de mort  It gives and carries death but in order to make a decision thus on a sentence arret of death it suspends death it stops it once more il l arrete encore   This is not then a passage to eternal life but rather a suspension of time not in order to cancel death but in order to live with it to account for it even though we can never actual y experience death We can read this suspension of death not as wishful thinking for it is certainly not for Derrida or Cioran but rather as an attempt to think as if not a category of biblical origin that plays an important role for Agamben As William Watkin explains for Agamben there is an opposition between living as if and as not The former is associated with estheticization and carries dangers with it Living as if while seemingly creative and thus an act of poiesis turns out to be selfdefeating both for thought and for art For not only does the spell over spel s cast a false veil over thinking it also misrepresents the poetic as wel  In contrast to this to live the as not is far from being nihilistic If as if is a belated and blinded decadence the as not depicts an alternate futural moment of authentic  The Fall Out of Redemption being If as not involves negation as indeed it does it is itself the negation of modern negativity in the form of a messianic moment to come which is the true state of modern nowtime The great question for modern thought therefore is How does one travel from as if to as not Watkin  Watkin is right to say that this preference for the as not in Agamben moves him toward a messianic mode of thinking the phrase as not is Saint Paul s a description of living in the end times that involves living in the world as if one were not real y living in it  that places him back within the logic of redemption As we have seen it is literary writers such as Baudelaire and Cioran rather than the critical theorists we have been examining who remain most faithful to the refusal of the logic of redemption The question arises in these writers as the quotation from Cioran above already suggests of how to live in a world that has shown to be devoid of redemptive possibility Baudelaire often portrays the poetic subject awaiting death frozen in contemplation despite the fact that our fallen state requires us to continue to live and with the added irony that while death may be thought to be a remedy it cannot actual y be so because it obliterates the subject altogether If revolt is fruitless what allows us to become unfrozen to speak in the terms of Le gout du neant and its poetic subject awaiting an avalanche to carry him away  It is helpful to return here to the notion of the artist s task of drawing out the eternal from the transitory as Baudelaire states in Le Peintre de la vie moderne The Painter of Modern Life  It is paradoxical y by an act of esthetic violence that Baudelaire clears the way for the possibility of shared experience with others a basis of some kind for an ethical relation The first step must be to reconsider the eternal and the transitory since the former is the condition in which by definition nothing happens since eternity implies a state of changelessness For there to be artistic creation at al  there needs to be a violent rupture with this eternal one that for Baudelaire takes its cue from the action of the fall which by being unredeemable is therefore also eternal The fall thus combines movement and changelessness in a way that paradise cannot and thereby becomes the basis of both esthetics and ethical relations in Baudelaire Such an interpretation finds support in the traces of theological discourse in Le Peintre de la vie moderne an essay that at first seems far removed from metaphysical or theological concerns with its famous discussions of transitory experience the dandy and the pleasures of makeup Baudelaire s principal contention in section one of the essay is well known le beau est toujours inevitablement d une composition double bien que l impression qu il produit soit une the beautiful is always inevitably of a double composition even though the impression it produces be unified OC   This duality consists in an eternal and a relative element the latter being comme l enveloppe amusante titil ante aperitive du divin gateau like the amusing titil ating stimulating exterior of the divine cake  Immediately after this initial description Baudelaire explains the origin of art s duality in these terms La dualite de l art est une consequence fatale de la dualite de l homme the duality of art is a fatal consequence of the duality Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  of man and offers another comparison in order to explain the point Considerez si cela vous plait la partie eternellement subsistante comme l ame de l art et l element variable comme son corps Consider if you wil  the eternal y subsisting part as the soul of art and the variable one as its body  Duality is one of the ideas that Baudelaire never real y cal s into question never negates and the fact that this is so has to do with the very nature of his argument about that duality namely that it is irretractable and irredeemable and that thus any effort at thought or artistic creation necessarily fal s back into the multiple no matter how much it may strive for unity For proof of this we need not go further than Baudelaire s theory of duality in the very paragraph we have been considering When he claims that beauty is double evn though the impression it makes is unified even his own duality is double since the unity of impression that he describes is necessarily linked to the duality of the beautiful When its impression is unified that impression of unity in turn cannot help but be subsumed under the duality of the beautiful since the beautiful as Baudelaire describes it here is now itself doubled consisting in the duality of the way it truly is as well as in the impression that it makes Unless Baudelaire is suggesting that beauty can appear without sensuous presentation that is without a perceiver who receives that unified impression then the duality of beauty is itself doubled when we consider the role of the unity of impression To make sense of the Baudelairean logic of duality as it manifests itself in the essay we need to take a step back from it and examine the philosophy that informs Baudelaire s implied and stated theories of esthetic production as well For Baudelaire s metaphysics of duality does not merely exist alongside the duality of modern beauty but rather as an essential and determining aspect of it But what does this all have to do with Le peintre de la vie moderne To get there we need to make one more detour this time to Baudelaire s drafts of prefaces for the  edition of Les Fleurs du Mal The first of these is crucial because it establishes a link between le Bien and le Beau Baudelaire sounds a familiar note when he attacks the notion of progress in full ironic mode Malgre les secours que quelques cuistres celebres ont apportes a la sottise naturelle de l homme je n aurais jamais cru que notre patrie put marcher avec une telle velocite dans la voie du progres Despite the aid that some famous pedants brought to man s natural stupidity I would never have believed that our country could walk with such speed in the way of progress OC   Rather than aspiring to the eternal changelessness of the divine humanity is horrified by that vision of changelessness and seeks to overcome it Baudelaire s first draft preface deals only briefly but forcefully with the question of beauty and the good J avais primitivement l intention de repondre a de nombreuses critiques et en meme temps d expliquer quelques questions tres simples totalement obscurcies par la lumiere moderne qu estce que la Poesie Quel est son but de la distinction du Bien d avec le Beau de la Beaute dans le Mal que le rythme et la rime repondent dans l homme aux immortels besoins de monotonie de symetrie et de surprise   The Fall Out of Redemption I at first had the intention to respond to numerous critiques and at the same time to explain some very simple questions total y obscured by modern light what is Poetry What is its goal The distinction between the Good and the Beautiful Beauty in Evil that rhythm and rhyme resonate in man with the immortal needs of monotony symmetry and surprise He renounces his plan of developing these explanations he says after realizing it would be useless to explain quoi que ce soit a qui que ce soit anything at all to anyone at al  But before abandoning his development Baudelaire provides a key insight to the relation between his esthetics and his metaphysics here human beings have eternal need of both monotony and surprise hence the possibility of rhythm and rhyme both to set up and potential y to violate expectations In terms of metaphysics we can see a putting into play of a foundational Baudelairean dualism involving the problem of Ennui a direct correlate with the monotony he evokes here in his mention of rhythm and rhyme We know that Ennui is marked from the very outset of Les Fleurs du Mal as a monster and that this fall into stasis is sometimes desired by the poet but is more often deplored as the monstrous state that it is Entanglement within ennui gives rise to the desire for action and often violent action as a way to shake off the stagnation This action can as we have seen take the form of satanic revolt which cancels ennui by violent blasphemy or of violence toward another or oneself Poems that feature such acts of violence respond to the esthetic and metaphysical desire for both monotony and surprise Such is the case in Je t adore a l egal de la voute nocturne I Adore You as Much as the Nocturnal Vault for instance whose conventions of love lyric are transformed in the last lines of the poem into an attack Je m avance a l attaque et je grimpe aux assauts Comme apres un cadavre un choeur de vermisseaux I advance to attack and I climb to assault Like a swarm of maggots after a cadaver  OC   The tension between monotony and surprise is even more marked in a poem such as A celle qui est trop gaie To One Who Is Too Gay which begins not so much in conventional love lyric as in sheer banality and calculated artlessness Ta tete ton geste ton air Sont beaux comme un beau paysage Le rire joue en ton visage Comme un vent frais dans un ciel clair Your head your bearing your gestures Are fair as a fair countryside Laughter plays on your face Like a cool wind in a clear sky  OC   only to end in a far more vividly described violent act than the one in Je t adore This is of course the famous lines Ainsi je voudrais une nuit Quand l heure des voluptes sonne Vers les tresors de ta personne Comme un lache ramper sans bruit Pour chatier ta chair joyeuse Pour meurtrir ton sein pardonne Et faire a ton flanc etonne Une blessure large et creuse OC  Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  Thus I should like some night When the hour for pleasure sounds To creep softly like a coward Toward the treasures of your body To whip your joyous flesh And bruise your pardoned breast To make in your astonished flank A wide and gaping wound  This violent surprise is also the selfinflicted torture of L heautontimoroumenos which takes on an important theological resonance when read in the light of the traditional characterization of humanity under the condition of original sin as incurvatus in se The rupture that produces human duality also renders the poetic act itself violent Baudelaire says as much in the last sentence of Le Confiteor de l artiste The Artist s Confiteor L etude du beau est une duel ou l artiste crie de frayeur avant d etre vaincu Studying the beautiful is a duel in which the artist shrieks with fright before being defeated  OC   Many other poems also feature a necessary act of violence toward the object of art which the poet represents as necessary in order to create the poem Such is the case in Je t adore a l egal de la voute nocturne Je t adore a l egal de la voute nocturne o vase de tristesse o grande taciturne Et t aime d autant plus belle que tu me fuis Et que tu me parais ornement de mes nuits Plus ironiquement accumuler les lieues Qui separent mes bras des immensites bleues Je m avance a l attaque et je grimpe aux assauts Comme apres un cadavre un choeur de vermisseaux Et je cheris o bete implacable et cruelle Jusqu a cette froideur par ou tu m es plus belle OC  I adore you as much as the nocturnal vault O vase of sadness most taciturn one I love you all the more because you flee from me And because you appear ornament of my nights More ironical y to multiply the leagues That separate my arms from the blue infinite I advance to attack and I climb to assault Like a swarm of maggots after a cadaver And I cherish implacable and cruel beast Even that coldness which makes you more beautiful   The Fall Out of Redemption Here the conception of beauty resembles the one in the poem La beaute where it is only by a violent act that the poet could hope to break the stoic silent stance of a beauty that is nearly total y inaccessible to the poet Je suis belle o mortels comme un reve de pierre Et mon sein ou chacun s est meurtri tour a tour Est fait pour inspirer au poete un amour Eternel et muet ainsi que la matiere I am fair O mortals like a dream carved in stone And my breast where each one in turn has bruised himself Is made to inspire in the poet a love As eternal and silent as matter  OC   This beauty does not inspire poetic creation but rather hinders it by inspiring mute love on the part of the poet a silence that he would have to break in order to craft a poem which one supposes would never be adequate to portray the beauty that he adores in silence unless it were as in Je t adore a l egal  to transform the beauty in such a way as to kill it We are now in a position to return to Le Peintre de la vie moderne since the other section of the essay that takes up the famous definition of art as consisting of the eternal and the transitory also returns in a brief but evocative and telling phrase to the kinds of metaphysical and theological questions we have been considering Section IV contains the most famous iteration of Baudelaire s characterization of the task of the artist which is to tirer l eternel du transitoire draw out the eternal from the transitory OC   This is in the context of a discussion of whether artists should dress their subjects in ancient costume or the clothing of their own time Here is how Baudelaire defends the use of contemporary costume Cet element transitoire fugitif dont les metamorphoses sont si frequentes vous n avez pas le droit de le mepriser ou de vous en passer En le supprimant vous tombez forcement dans le vide d une beaute abstraite et indefinissable comme celle de l unique femme avant le premier peche This transitory fugitive element whose metamorphoses are so frequent you do not have the right to disdain it or do without it By suppressing it you necessarily fall into the void of an abstract and undefinable beauty such as that of the only woman before the first sin  What is this prelapsarian woman doing here Baudelaire s phrasing is surprising not least for the incongruous use of the word tombez fal here In the context of a discussion of the first sin the reader expects the fall to refer to entry into the condition of original sin But here intriguingly the fall is not into sin but rather a leap back to the condition of innocence Since it is clear that Baudelaire is arguing against the avoidance of the contemporary in art his comparison suggests that what we might at first glance consider to be ideal beauty that before the fall is in fact undesirable for art the void of an abstract and undefinable beauty is to be shunned and hence Baudelaire s appeal to the contemporary embodiment of beauty And here we arrive at the theological crux of Baudelaire s argument if the abstract beauty of the prelapsarian woman is to be avoided at all costs that means that sin is the very condition of art itself If beauty were accessible without the embodied form of painting or poetry there would be no need of artmaking at all It is thus not as a reparatory or compensatory gesture that we make art nor is it in order to wallow in the perverse pleasures of evil but rather in order paradoxically to avoid falling back into a state of innocence in which beauty remains a void Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  because it has no form All art then depends on the fall and on an irredeemable fall at that Cioran agrees with Baudelaire on this point He writes in the Cahiers L ecrivain c est le triomphe du vieil homme des vieilles tares de l humanite c est l homme avant la Redemption Pour l ecrivain le Redempteur n est pas venu effectivement ou son action redemptrice n a pas reussi L ecrivain se felicite de l erreur d Adam et ne prospere que dans la mesure ou chacun de nous la renouvelle et la prend a son compte C est l humanite taree dans son essence qui constitue la matiere de toute oeuvre On ne cree qu a partir de la Chute C  The writer is the triumph of the old man of the old stains of humanity it is man before Redemption For the writer the Redeemer has not come actual y or his redemptive action did not succeed The writer is glad about Adam s error and only prospers to the extent that each one of us renews it and takes it as his own It is humanity stained in its essence that constitutes the material of every work One only creates from the basis of the Fal  It is by a necessarily violent act which aligns itself with the transitory that the artist succeeds or at least attempts to create the artwork not so much to create beauty itself but rather to give it form without which it would remain in the void Hence the second section of Je t adore with its Je m avance a l attaque I advance to attack makes more sense in the broader Baudelairean conception of artistic creation which the poet describes in Le soleil The Sun as ma fantasque escrime my fanciful fencing  OC   The word recurs in Le Peintre de la vie moderne with reference to Guys Maintenant a l heure ou les autres dorment celuici est penche sur sa table dardant sur une feuille de papier le meme regard qu il attachait tout a l heure sur les choses s escrimant avec son crayon sa plume son pinceau faisant jaillir l eau du verre au plafond essuyant sa plume sur sa chemise presse violent actif comme s il craignait que les images ne lui echappent querelleur quoique seul et se bousculant luimeme OC  Now at the hour when others are sleeping this one is bent over his table shooting at a piece of paper the same glance that he just now was attaching to things fencing with his pencil his pen his brush making gush forth the water from the glass to the ceiling wiping his pen on his shirt hurried violent active as if we were afraid that the images would escape him quarrelsome even though alone and jostling himself Art is necessarily violent whether that violence has an external object or is turned against the artist himself or whether it seems to have no object whatsoever as in the passage I have just quoted where it is not blood that springs forth but rather an innocent glass of water  The Fall Out of Redemption Baudelaire s prose poems are the locus of the most extensive development of the link between ethics and esthetics in light of the asoteriological worldview that he works out in Les Fleurs du Mal significantly given what we have just seen in terms of the relationship of violence and esthetic creation several key moments in the prose poems put violence and esthetic creation center stage in a way that simultaneously explores the ethical relation to the other and in doing so the relation to self In that sense by developing the consequences of the split self that Baudelaire had already identified in Les Fleurs du Mal the prose poems become the site of the ironic ethical encounter as that has been described by Gary Handwerk Irony is a response to and not just an expression of the fragmentation of the human world it accepts as inevitable Rather than trying to define or fix identity it opens out into the dialogue the response where identity can come into being Irony provokes a movement toward intersubjective coherence by exposing the unacknowledged seams of personal identity It is a testing for rather than an assumption of shared values hence it necessarily oscil ates back to the here and now grounding the transcendental moment of doubt in the real encounter In its fullest operation irony is the expression of the mind in search of what wil suffice   While the prose poems are often set in the modern city the problems they pose defy attempts to read the poems reductively as a manifestation of experiences that could only be possible in that urban environment The generalized nature of the characters and the setting encourage a wider philosophical and esthetic lens and the poems themselves actively resist attempts to provide a single exhaustive interpretation One of the most hyperbolically violent and puzzling of these poems is Assommons les pauvres Let s Beat up the Poor which provides an intriguing window into the relation of ethics and esthetics in the prose poems The opening presents the move from abstract concerns to lived experience with the poet representing himself confine dans sa chambre shut up in his room for two weeks reading books a la mode dans ce tempsla fashionable at that time  OC   This is not quite a representation of abstract contemplation for we are given to believe that the works the poet has been reading are those of popular utopian socialists tous ces entrepreneurs de Bonheur public all those managers of public happiness  But the principle of absorbing an idea until one is drawn to test the idea empirically is consonant with Baudelaire s general interest here in portraying the lived consequences of his asoteriological atheology The poet claims to have digested and swallowed the contents of his reading the effect of which is a state bordering on le vertige ou la stupidite vertigo or idiocy  What emerges from his reading is le germe obscure d une idee superieure a toutes les formules de bonne femme dont j avais recemment parcouru le dictionnaire Mais ce n etait que l idee d une idee quelque chose d inifiniment vague the dim seed of an idea better than all the old wives formulas I had recently perused in the encyclopedia But it was only the idea of an idea something infinitely hazy  OC   It is at this point Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  that the poet takes to the street inspired by a voice that he hears which in contrast to Socrates demon is un grand affirmateur un Demon d action un Demon de combat A great approver a Demon of action or Demon of combat    The status of the poet s idea is never explicitly clarified after this since the idea is transfigured by or clarified by or worked out through the violence he inflicts on a beggar he encounters It is the Demon that speaks the maxim that the poet will attempt to demonstrate by action Celuila seul est l egal d un autre qui le prouve et celuila seul est digne de la liberte qui sait la conquerir He alone is equal to another if he proves it and he alone is worthy of freedom if he can conquer it    While the poet succeeds in convincing the beggar of this definition of liberty and equality and sending him off to beat others as he has been beaten it is first of all never clear that such convincing is equivalent to establishing the truth of the maxim and second of all that we are to accept the sincerity of the maxim While the poem moves us from books into the street from contemplation to action it does not go so far as to allow the reader to decide definitively whether the poem at hand is meant to be taken as a parody or not The lack of any clearly discernible message is not only what makes the poem intriguing it is also what maintains the duality that sustains any Baudelairean articulation of the self or philosophy of creation The violence of the creative act is not redeemed by coming to rest in a determinate meaning but is rather left in dynamic suspension what we have in Assommons les pauvres is both a satire of theories of equality and the performance of genuine equality It is not so much a case of undecidability between two or more options as it is a simultaneity of contrasting interpretive possibilities so that the action performed by the poem forces the reader back to the contemplative moment akin to the one from which the poet had emerged at the beginning of the poem The reader unlike the poetcharacter contemplates unresolvable duality a condition which by virtue of Baudelaire s asoteriology no form of action could cancel or transcend  The impossibility of redemptive political action implies another important shift that Baudelaire accomplishes in this poem namely from the political to the ethical For while Baudelaire may have lost faith in political transformation in the wake of the events of  the prose poems often put ethical relations in the broad sense of encounters with and relations to others center stage as Assommons les pauvres certainly does That is not to say that there is a discernible moral at work in the texts nor is the ethical merely reducible to compassion for the suffering of others although that is certainly visible in the texts as wel  But the ethical as opposed to the political relationship is primary in Le Spleen de Paris for while explicitly political positions appear under the sign of mocking irony such as in Le Miroir The Mirror  where a character invokes the immortal principles of  to justify his looking at himself in the mirror OC   or indeed in Assommons les pauvres where the initial target of satire was PierreJoseph Proudhon as an earlier version of the poem attests ethical relations are not consistently ironized and in fact often seem to spring from genuine compassion on the part of the poet  By removing the specificity associated with Proudhon s ideas in particular Baudelaire  The Fall Out of Redemption generalizes the political into the ethical In so doing he emphasizes the equality of human beings that is at the base of the implied ethics of the prose poems an equality established not political y but rather theological y as a result of Baudelaire s faithful insistence on the primacy of original sin But we should go further and say that it is not exactly the theological notion of original sin but rather as I have been arguing the atheological notion of irredeemable original sin that establishes the equality of the ethical relation since removing the possibility of redemption also removes one more potential source of inequality if all are equal under original sin an unequal relation would result from the division of humanity into the saved and the damned But since no such division is possible in Baudelaire s metaphysics the possibility of equal ethical relation remains always open And thus when the poet says to the beggar who has just returned his blows Monsieur vous etes mon egal Sir you are my equal  OC   we cannot read the same kind of irony as we could in Le Miroir where the political as opposed to existential equality posited by the speaker is clearly the site of irony and ridicule  The equality posited in Assommons les pauvres may well be a satire of Proudhon but it is never only that again the duality inscribed in the interpretation of the poem itself testifies to the duality introduced with original sin and points the way toward ethical relation not beyond but within that condition coterminous with the irony That irony and duality are also what allow equality and violence to coexist and even seem mutually dependent in this poem And the violence that inaugurates the ethical equality here points to another aspect of Baudelaire s logic of the fall namely the impossibility of acting meaningfully upon the equality posited in the poem As Steve Murphy notes if the beggar does as the narrator suggests at the end of the poem and gives half his money to those who take his beating and give it back to him as he had done to the narrator there will be an everdiminishing quantity of money shared since the beggar will be giving half of a half of the original sum and so on whereas the bourgeois will always have in principle his half of the purse an alegebra of disparity where the inequality will be maintained Murphy   The turn to action where the poem suspends itself would thus perpetuate actual inequality based on the principles of ethical equality yet another manifestation of the impossibility in Baudelaire s world of maintaining a nondualistic and unironic take on equality The distance between the theoretical equality effected by unredeemed original sin and the actual political or economic inequality that it produces when put into practice comes to be figured for those who refuse the comingtoanend of the poem and extend its action of the poem beyond the poem s actual stopping point as another fall into the duality of both affirming and denying the possibility of realized or realizable ethical equality It is from this I would argue that stems what Steve Murphy identifies as the late Baudelaire s mode of thought not an affirmative ideology but an ensemble of convictions of which the most tenacious would be perhaps intuitions and inferences of a negative and fatalistic order   Such fatalism is on view in Le Spleen de Paris in poems such as Chacun sa chimere To Each His Chimera  whose setting sous un grand ciel gris dans Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  une grande plaine poudreuse under a huge gray sky on a huge dusty plain  OC   removes it from any definable place and time The characters are no more recognizable historical y they are presented as generalized figures each of whom is carrying sur son dos une enorme Chimere an enormous Chimera on his back    They are traveling but they know neither why nor where When the poet inquires where they are headed one of them responds that il n en savait rien ni lui ni les autres mais qu evidemment ils al aient quelque part puisqu ils etaient pousses par un invincible besoin de marcher he knew nothing about it not he nor the others but that obviously they were going somewhere since they were driven by an irresistible need to walk    While this setting stands in contrast to poems such as Assommons les pauvres clearly set in a contemporary urban street I would argue that Baudelaire s atemporal and temporal y specific poems do not exist in tension but rather in complementarity Rather than seeing the urban poems of either Les Fleurs du Mal or Le Spleen de Paris as a descent from or an alteration of Baudelaire s more metaphysical y inflected poems the most fruitful readings underscore the continuity between the historical y specific and more generalized settings in Baudelaire The shock of the contemporary urban experience extends from and is informed by the same asoteriology that guides all of Baudelaire s work To be able to see the space of a poem as simultaneously historical y grounded and specific and metaphysical y generalized is part of participating in the kind of double vision that Baudelaire encourages and which is written into the fabric of his ideas of irony and the fal  The undifferentiated space of Chacun sa chimere enacts such a penetration of the metaphysical into the historical For Jerome Thelot the gray and powdery landscape of this poem enacts the abolition of the separation between sky and earth Violence  the space of the poem is that of modern democracies a metaphysical space situated either before or after culture a time of no time   The space is thus historically specific and metaphysically generalized on this reading it represents the historical bringing to concreteness of the metaphysical void that Baudelaire has theorized The relationship between the historical and the metaphysical far from unilinear or determining in one direction or the other is dynamic in Baudelaire with historical reality both providing the conditions of the disclosure of the metaphysical reality and shaping the way it is theorized Central to all of this for Baudelaire is the act of esthetic creation itself The creation of a poem is a fall from the virtual or possible into the actual an intervention that is consequence and product of the fall Thelot reads the poem as the Chimere des chimeres derniere folie du langage interieure au langage violence de la violence Chimera of chimeras last madness of language interior to language violence of violence and adds the Chimeras of the walkers their condemnation which is their myth are known and understood and pronounced a coagulation of words fantasies prejudices by which walking becomes wandering the city becomes a desert and dialogue becomes silence Violence   In a move similar to the one that the poet makes in Le Cygne The Swan  everything becomes allegory but  The Fall Out of Redemption the poem is not reducible to simple allegorical status Rather the creation of the poem participates itself in the kind of falling that it describes Baudelaire s poetry is for Thelot a selfknowing phenomenon Of what is poetry capable Knowing itself and by that stripping us of the fascinations which constitute but also condemn us   Cioran s notion of ludicity and his status as le detrompe the one without il usions are echoed here in these claims about poetry s epistemological function The knowledge which as we saw in a comment of Walter Benjamin s that is ful y worked out in Baudelaire is a knowledge of evil alone is inscribed in Chacun sa chimere at the end of the poem when the poet moves from merely observing the passing figures to contemplating what he saw Et pendant quelques instants je m obstinai a vouloir comprendre ce mystere mais bientot l irresistible Indifference s abattit sur moi et j en fus plus lourdement accable qu ils ne l etaient euxmemes par leurs ecrasantes Chimeres And for a few moments I persistently tried to understand this mystery But soon insurmountable Apathy swooped down upon me and I was more heavily oppressed than they were themselves by their overwhelming Chimeras    The poet represents his thought as a striving an effort of the will to understand but he ultimately sinks back into indifference or we could say indifferentiation fading back into the landscape itself and dissolving the distinction between observer and observed that he had maintained while watching the travelers He becomes so to speak a fellow traveler by the end of the poem becoming one with the others by virtue of the burden he now feels in its full force in his own body after having observed it in others In doing so he joins the company of those having the resigned look of those who are condamnes a esperer toujours condemned to hope forever    Once again the moment of lucidity on the poet s part cancels it seems the condemnation to hope and reveals the unredeemable quality of the condition the poet describes Hope is traded for lucidity and the poem ultimately suggests that the lucidity is preferable to the eternal y unfulfilled and unfulfil able hope that pushes these travelers on So while the poet is assimilated to the travelers by the crushing weight of the burden he carries he is at the same time differentiated by the difference in kind of the burden Chacun sa chimere performs this simultaneous identity and distance from others on the part of the poet in the context of the poem itself emerging from nothingness and returning there by the resistance to closure that is a hallmark of the endings of Baudelaire s poems in both verse and prose The inertia and inaction of the end of Chacun sa chimere stand in tension with poems that involve a sudden and irrational burst of action such as Assommons les pauvres and another of the most famous of the prose poems Le Mauvais vitrier The Bad Glazier  The first half of the poem features the poet speaking as a sort of moralist presenting generalized observations and enumerating several examples of the phenomenon of des natures purement contemplatives et tout a fait impropres a l action characters purely contemplative and completely unsuited for action  OC  who sometimes are given to uncharacteristic and violent bursts of action In the second half of the poem the poet indicates that he himself is among this group and narrates an anecdote about his having invited a glazier to climb the many flights Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  to his apartment only to chase him away for not having any colored panes of glass to sell in the impoverished neighborhood where he was hawking his wares The action culminates in the narrator throwing a flower pot on the glazier s head causing him to fall back and break his merchandise while the narrator continues to cry out la vie en beau Make life beautiful    The enigmatic anecdote is rich terrain for interpretation with its staging of relationships involving commercial culture economic disparity and the role of art with passing references to competing hermeneutic claims of medicine and religion as wel  in the narrator s affirmation that the inspiration toward action that he is describing is hysterique selon les medecins satanique selon ceux qui pensent un peu mieux que les medecins hysterical according to physicians satanic according to those who think a little more lucidly than physicians    The tale seems allegorical but one is not certain of what exactly and it can certainly be read as parody of La chanson du vitrier The Song of the Glazier by Arsene Houssaye but any attempt to pin the text definitively to one particular interpretation is bound to leave the whole incompletely accounted for Critical commentary on this poem tends to focus more on its second half that is on the action more than on the abstract reflection of the first half After enumerating several examples of those contemplative natures that sometimes explode into action in a key transitional paragraph the poet poses an epistemological question about his last example which is an enthusiastic embrace by a usually shy man of an old man in public Pourquoi Parce que parce que cette physionomie lui etait irresisitiblement sympathique Peutetre mais il est plus legitime de supposer que luimeme il ne sait pas pourquoi Why Because because he found his expression irresistibly likeable Perhaps but it is more legitimate to assume that he himself does not know why    Unknowing is thus at the heart of the poem whether the poet is discussing others motivations or his own belief in a hypothesis is as far as he can go in terms of an explanatory account of behavior In the final short paragraph before the anecdote in the second half begins the poet indicates that he himself has been drawn to the sudden crises of action qui nous autorisent a croire que des Demons malicieux se glissent en nous et nous font accomplir a notre insu leurs plus absurdes volontes which justify our belief that some malicious Demons slip into us and without us knowing it make us carry out their most absurd wishes    Once again Baudelaire refuses to accord credibility to a scientific hypothesis of hysteria and prefers an explanation that this time floats somewhere between the theological and the philosophical the malicious Demons evoking either Christian devillike creatures or figures such as Descartes hypothetical evil genius dedicated to deceiving Descartes about everything he knows to be true or as Steve Murphy suggests the word can have the etymological meaning of protective genie as it does in Assommons les pauvres Murphy   The tale that the poet then recounts seems to pick up where Chacun sa chimere left off in the state of indolence Un matin je m etais leve maussade triste fatigue d oisivete et pousse me sembletil a faire quelque chose de grand One morning I had awakened sullen sad and worn out with idleness and I felt impelled to do something great    As we saw in Les Fleurs du Mal the  The Fall Out of Redemption temptation to action as a corrective to the kind of ennui evoked here will ultimately prove futile since no action can bring about the desired effect of the cancelation of existence Like the poet asking the avalanche to carry him away the poet of Le mauvais vitrier wishes to transcend inertia and pass into action a wish that he already reveals to be detrimental to him by his own comment on his first action et j ouvris la fenetre helas and I opened the window alas    This poem never returns to the contemplative state that is the normal mode of being for this poet but if we were to project the action beyond the end of the poem the poet would be likely to return to the state of contemplation and inaction that he claims is proper to his nature We also must return invariably to the unknown the he does not know why that is at the heart of this poem The action narrated in the second half does not so much replace the contemplation that precedes it so much as it provides a variation that is in continuity with that contemplation the doing and the inability to provide a definitive interpretation of the action go hand in hand here What the poem does open up though is the ethical relation to the other When the poet opens the window he transgresses the boundary that kept the contemplative self isolated from the street thus imposing the question of the relation to the others with whom he shares the literal space of the city and the metaphorical space of reflection Will the other person he encounters turn out to be interchangeable with the self as the victim of the violence in L heautontimoroumenos had been While the action represented in the poem tends to confirm the hypothesis that we explored earlier of contemplation as always necessarily linked to evil as contemplation of evil it frustrates any further attempt to make clear sense of the precise relation of action to contemplation or of the poet to the other The poem does posit such a relation however even if in its complexity it is not reducible to intellectual understanding The action of the poem in contrast to that of Assommons les pauvres is not the testing of a hypothesis a descent into the street to determine whether reality corresponds to theories about it Thus any question about the motivation of the poet or the outcome of the poem sends us back to the center to the he does not know why that unites poet victim and reader here via that very incomprehensibility Even the most basic questions about the poem turn out to be unanswerable once the reader begins to inquire about them The speaking subject for instance is usual y taken to be a poet such a reading chimes with that character s insistence on beauty an esthetic concern that seems to trump all others for him Jerome Thelot has proposed however that it is not the narrator but the glazier who is the figure of the poet here He outlines a complex process of substitution initiated by the moment of reflection immediately following the narrator s invitation to the glazier to come up Cependant je reflechissais Meanwhile I was thinking   Reflect reflect in a mirror represent the reflexive consciousness Baudelaire doubles himself in writing dreamer and glazier executioner and victim to reflect and reveal the sacrificial structure of consciousness the genesis of the self by the expulsion of the Other who is the brother The glazier attains the Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  consciousness of the dreamer by the cry separating him from the crowd and by the ascension leading him to the chamber of art But crying out and raising himself he is the dreamer who cries and consecrates himself to art Such that in this cry and this elevation or this violence and this forgetting it is selfconsciousness that the glazier the dreamer attains Reflexivity self consciousness derives from sacrifice and from the misunderstanding of the double which are a sacrifice and misunderstanding of self Identification of self with self operates by doubling and consciousness is dreamy discriminating To operate to cut and make a work slice and write  is to be Violence   On this reading the narrator plays the role not of the poet but of the public seeking a simple transformation of ugly reality into a more appealing vision via art One would be right to be skeptical about such a view lining up with Baudelaire s esthetics which challenge all conventional and popular notions of beauty The violence that Baudelaire seeks to enact is not on those who do not provide rosy optimism but rather on those who seek that as the principal source of value in art At any rate Thelot s argument is more complicated than that suggesting as it does that the poem breaks down the division between narrator and glazier not in order to evoke a solipsistic world where everything is a product of the narrator s own consciousness but rather to use Baudelaire s notion of ironical y divided subjectivity in order to imagine a new relationship to the other that both allows the narrator to identify with the glazier and also to call for his sacrifice an act of necessary violence that becomes also a violence inflicted on the self We have then an ethics of equality that can invoke identity only because I am other to myself just as I am identified with another In the second moment of the Baudelairean relation to the first person one happens upon the other is lost he becomes the Other the tyranny of the human face  Hatred substitutes for the presence of one s fellow the threat of an enemy and obfuscating the gaze that it distorts into a vision it dreams up a rival in place of the neighbor Moment of violence This glazier is my obstacle Art tyrannical religion of the poet imposes that the other be misunderstood in his proper being It fears above all this passage in front of the staircase of its temple of this simply simple passerby When Vengeance beats its infernal reminder And of our faculties makes itself the captain according to Reversibility  hatred dream and art associate together in the same discriminating operation they erase the trace of charity transfigure the brother and forbid speech   Le mauvais vitrier thus complicates the estheticoethical relation that we saw operating in Je t adore a l egal  where esthetic creation demands the destruction of the subject in order to effect the esthetic transformation In Le mauvais vitrier the esthetic act also creates the ethical relation that establishes both distance and proximity between the self and the other a kind of substitutability that allows for an ethical relation that does not preclude violence toward the self but at the same time  The Fall Out of Redemption it allows the recognition of equality in the other a col apsing of the space between self and other that is enacted in the poem by the transfer of the flower pot from the narrator s hands to the glazier s head The violence of the falling flower pot and the shattered glass cannot said to be redemptive here it does not create the ethical relation so much as enact or reveal it At the same time though the violence in the poem cannot be called senseless either the narrator s own motivations are clear his frustration with the lack of colored panes  and within the logic of the creation of the poem there is also a motivation namely the necessarily violent act that brings the poem into being the violent rupture in the ordinary that makes the story worth recounting and the poem worth discussing Stil  though the sense that would be conferred on the act if it were in fact redemptive is not in operation here and given the importance of the ethical relation that is established in this poem one cannot simply identify a merely esthetic impetus to the violence In that sense this poem stands in contrast to other earlier Baudelaire poems that seem to privilege art for art s sake the notion that as Baudelaire himself puts it poetry n a pas la Verite pour objet elle n a qu Ellememe does not have Truth for its object it has only Itself OC   The action in Le mauvais vitrier stands in contrast to those poems that feature eternal waiting such as Le gout du neant The Taste for Nothingness or Le mauvais moine The Bad Monk Mon ame est un tombeau que mauvais cenobite Depuis l eternite je parcours et j habite Rien n embellit les murs de ce cloitre odieux o moine faineant quand sauraije donc faire Du spectacle vivant de ma triste misere Le travail de mes mains et l amour de mes yeux OC  My soul is a tomb where bad cenobite I wander and dwell eternal y Nothing adorns the wal s of that loathsome cloister O lazy monk When shall I learn to make Of the living spectacle of my bleak misery The labor of my hands and the love of my eyes  Bertrand Marchal sees in Baudelaire s artforart ssake stance a source of both sin and redemption a sin of pride as a kind of idolatry and a kind of redemption par soi et pour soi redemption by and for oneself The bad monk is still a monk not only by his solitude this time an essential solitude  but also because art which has no other primary material than the sad material of the poet assumes in its way a redemptive function   There is a tension here between the infinite waiting implied by the question posed at the end of the poem and the fact that what we are reading is of course a finished poem that tension tends to implicate the poetic subject Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  further in the ironical y doubled subjectivity at play in Le mauvais vitrier That ironic subjectivity cal s into question the extent to which we can affirm a sense of esthetic redemption a la Nietzsche in Baudelaire Le mauvais vitrier I would argue cal s into question the possibility of such an estheticist stance by affirming that it is not possible to engage in esthetic creation without creating an ethical relation to an other and that this relation automatical y removes us from the realm of the purely esthetic thus canceling the redemptive value of it or at least moving it into the realm of the temporary and the inconclusive We can recall here Cioran s notion of the temporary salvation to be found in poetry Exercice ou revelation qu importe Nous lui demandons nous autres qu elle nous delivre de l oppression des affres du discours Si elle y reussit elle fait pour un instant notre salut Exercise or revelation what does it matter We ask of it we others that it deliver us from oppression from the torments of discourse If it succeeds it makes for an instant our salvation Pl    And in fact that temporary release along with the nonchalance of the what does it matter finds direct resonance in the final sentence of Le mauvais vitrier which returns to the theological register Mais qu importe l eternite de la damnation a qui a trouve dans une seconde l infini de la jouissance But what does an eternity of damnation matter to someone who has experienced for one second the infinity of delight  OC  Like so many of the Baudelaire poems we have examined this one too eschews definitive conclusion sending the reader back to the center of the poem and its affirmation of unknowing Why he does not know why It is hard to see the poem as redemptive given the eternal lapse back into the contemplation that was broken only momentarily by the burst of action that establishes the ethical relation without thereby seeing any redemptive value in it rather the ethical relation is produced by the impossibility of redemptive violence which would end the ethical relation by destroying the other as victim The temptation to act functions here like the temptation to conclude neither one can effect permanent change and neither one can bring redemption And with such an ambiguous conclusion the reader too is brought into ethical relation with the poet and forced to recognize that a definitive conclusion would also be the death of the work of art which would exist as stale artefact if ever removed from the dynamic interpretive relation between poet and reader yet another manifestation of the way the ethical and esthetic relations are inextricably intertwined for Baudelaire What emerges as a key feature of the ethical relation as it is posited in the prose poems is that it is a form of solidarity without communication As JeanLuc Steinmetz indicates Le Spleen de Paris no longer carries any of the sentimental and idealist il usions that Les Fleurs du Mal contained But the very movement that draws us to the other is just as strong there  Without placing the mark of original sin in the foreground which he affirms in his journals  Baudelaire is persuaded of the noncommunication between men Besides he does not at all wish to enter the crushing era of equality since he insists above all on preserving his identity his  The Fall Out of Redemption uniqueness The book occupies a border zone where philosophers doctors and moralists can be evoked For the new poetry understands itself to be situated at this intersection of the mind heart and body in this drama of the incarnation which no doubt forbids that the other be more than a rival  One could multiply examples of figures evoked as deserving pity in the prose poems but moments of communication are rare and what Steve Murphy referring to Les Yeux des pauvres The Eyes of the Poor has labeled a manque de communication d ames lack of communication of souls  dominates intersubjective relationships throughout the poems for reasons we have been exploring If the other presents him or herself as a rival as Steinmetz claims this is in part due to the violent nature of the doubled subjective relationship to oneself as well in Baudelaire and it does not cancel the possibility of ethical relation although it does seriously compromise as I have argued a political relation The ethical relationship that is mediated by the theological allows for a relation to the other that is based on little to no contact with that other an abstracted relation that remains valid even though the actual moments of encounter represented in the prose poems are almost always marked by the impossibility of contact gross misunderstandings or violence In Le mauvais vitrier even the violence is effected without contact between the characters with the flower pot bridging the considerable spatial gap that separates them at the end of the poem The flower pot thus brings together and separates the characters its fal  with all of the remnants of the theological that that notion might contain here both establishes and destroys the distance between the characters and that simultaneous distance and proximity is emblematic of the ethical relationship as it is established in the prose poems general y Even the intersubjective relationships that are not marked by violence also feature the simultaneous distance and proximity that has emerged in all the poems we have been considering Such is the case in Mademoiselle Bistouri Miss Scalpel  where the title character s presumed insanity provides a barrier toward the kind of real solidarity that might have been provoked by the narrator s sympathy for her The narrator s evening encounter is disconcerting on account both of the woman s delusions she is sure the narrator is a doctor and of her sexual interest in doctors and their bloody operating clothes There is a sort of dialogue de sourds as the narrator at first attempts to correct the woman s mistaken impression that he is a doctor and then asks questions as an analyst might about why she has the impressions that she has and for how long she has had a fetish for surgeons The whole exchange is presented rather matteroffactly with just this comment from the narrator at the end of the dialogue Quelles bizarreries ne trouveton pas dans une grande ville quand on sait se promener et regarder La ville fourmille de monstres innocents What weirdness you find in big cities when you know how to walk about and look Life swarms with innocent monsters  OC   The poem is unusual in that the narrator plays the role of the rationalist seeking to understand or perhaps to diagnose Mademoiselle Bistouri Murphy    as opposed to other poems such as L Etranger The Stranger  where the firstperson speaker is rather himself Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  the aberrant case subject to questioning or Le mauvais vitrier in which as we just saw the narrator derides attempts at scientific or medical explanation and suggests that traditional notions of the demonic would be more apt in terms of accounting for aberrant cases But he ultimately renounces the possibility of accounting for Mademoiselle Bistouri in these terms and ends the poem idiosyncratical y with a prayer to a God qui avez peutetre mis dans mon esprit le gout de l horreur pour convertir mon coeur comme la guerison au bout d une lame who have perhaps placed a taste for horror in my mind in order to convert my heart like a cure at knife point  OC   asking him to have pity on the insane and asking whether they can truly be monsters in the eyes of the Creator qui sait pourquoi ils existent comment ils se sont faits et comment ils auraient pu ne pas se faire who knows why they exist how they were made and how they might have been able not to be made  OC   The tone becomes increasingly tentative as the poem reaches its conclusion with the strong affirmation of conversion at knife point governed by a peutetre maybe that has the potential to cancel the entire affirmation and the total y open possibility that the insane could in fact by God s inscrutable ways be monsters despite God s merciful nature As JA Hiddleston remarks the prayer which seems to plead in favor of innocent monsters is as much a challenge to the existence of divine providence and order as an indication of submission and belief in their reality it borders on the blasphemous and points not to providence but to a moral anarchy at the heart of the universe   There is simultaneous distance and proximity between Mademoiselle Bistouri and the narrator who is strangely drawn to her at the same time as he perceives her on the other side of the sanity divide We have yet again a solidarity that stems from distance and from a shared sense of the unredeemable fall that is no doubt at the root of the tentative nature of the prayer and its inability to assert God s mercy with full confidence What then is the status of the cure at knife point a powerful and yet as presented entirely metaphorical conversion For Edward Kaplan Mademoiselle Bistouri is a crucial moment in what he reads as a progression toward the ethical as the prose poems progress from the beginning to the end of the collection For him the poem most sharply juxtaposes the esthetic and the ethical and that which transcends them while including both the religious   and he argues that the conversion evoked by Baudelaire in the prayer is indeed to be understood in a fairly strong religious sense Her madness serves no apparent goal whereas the narrator suggests that his taste for horror should convert his heart like a cure at knifepoint He in fact succeeds   Jerome Thelot reads the scene differently in the context of the poet s appropriation of Pascal s writings on the operation of conversion Miss Scalpel could operate the conversion of the poet with her weakness which draws to her his strength and which already makes the poem turn into a final prayer Baudelaire works with Pascal s lexicon but he displaces the base conversion is not for him an effect of grace it does not have its origin in God it does not come from the strong transcendence that Augustinian theology aims  The Fall Out of Redemption at under the name of God since it is an effect of the horror suffered by the sick and the poor in spirit it has its origins not in God but in the other and it comes from a weak transcendence if this word can still designate the mysterious relation between a worried poet and his former accomplice who is sick from now on L Immemorial   We could say that for Thelot the transcendence that operates here is so weak as to dissolve entirely that what used to be labeled the effect of a divinity is figured here as an entirely human relation While Baudelaire preserves the shell of theological discourse by putting the talk of conversion in the form of a prayer the ethical relation to the other has bypassed the divine here an effect which is I would argue the final consequence of the refusal of redemption The cry to God for pity is unaccompanied by any reassurance that it will be heard and answered and the appeal to God seems to come more from one of ceux qui sont condamnes a esperer toujours as the poet puts it in Chacun sa chimere OC   If the poet s heart is converted in Mademoiselle Bistouri it is not to faith and certainly not to the hope of redemption but rather to a kind of ethical relation that draws the poet and Mademoiselle Bistouri together by the same gesture that also maintains them in an uncancelable distance from one another This is the ironic duality of the conversionwithinthefal  a conversion which is itself double because it exists as an effect of empathy without permitting any closer ethical relation and also because the conversion as Baudelaire describes it here may not even be a conversion since the qualifying maybe cancels any strength we might want to attribute to the claim about an actual conversion of any sort here This ethical relationship between the two individuals in the poem can be generalized to the level of the community where the conditions for a sense of connection between subjects are both established and prevented by the solidarity that under the sign of irony both unites and divides communities just as it divides the individual subjectivity from itself The ethical relationship is thus generalized to include even the subject s own relation to itself Admittedly this leads us to a potential y unsatisfying answer about the nature of the ethical relation in Baudelaire in that the relation is left open under the sign of the conditional mood and the eternal qualifying maybe but to go beyond this risks failing to do justice to the openness of Baudelaire s own texts which both call for and resist attempts at closure in terms of meaning To raise the question of the possibility of ethical progression throughout the collection of prose poems is to cede to the desire to conclude a teleological orientation which as I have argued throughout this study is common to both philosophy and poetry The fact that in individual poems as well as across the scope of both Les Fleurs du Mal and Le Spleen de Paris both on their own terms and in relation to each other the sense of a conclusion is weakened by the poetry s tendency to circle back on itself suggests the extent to which Baudelaire refuses the linear teleological orientation that comes with a philosophical and esthetic model based on the logic of redemption Reading the prose poems draws us as readers into the circular structure of the frustrated desire to conclude since the reader plays an essential role in the process of deriving meaning from the prose poems In that sense Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  Baudelaire renews the relationship between himself and the hypocrite lecteur mon semblable mon frere hypocritish reader my fellow my brother  OC   and once again as it had been in Les Fleurs du Mal this relationship is at once an esthetic and ethical one whereby the poet posits both proximity to and distance from the reader in the same way as the narrator of so many of the prose poems is both near to and separated from the other subjects he encounters As Steve Murphy notes the dominant esthetics and ethics of the prose poems consists in never handing over to the reader a simple value judgment as an authorauthority but allowing him a more active role in the reception of the text   The reader is called upon not to complete the work by arriving at a definitive interpretation but rather by residing in the doubleness and uncertainty of the poems themselves inhabiting the space of unredeemed irony that both allows the esthetic act and reinforces the ethical bond between poet and reader which becomes emblematic of the solidarity of nonredemption among all human subjects general y enacted in relationship with one s own doubled self and with those one encounters on the page or on the streets in a community without communication Esthetic creation thus enacts even and especial y through the violence it inflicts on the objects from which the creation stems an esthetic and ethical relationship that extends the realm of the possible as Paul Audi has noted Creer ne veut pas dire produire un objet un objet dote d une matiere et d une forme creer veut dire conferer par cette production meme une nouvelle puissance a l esprit une puissance capable par l instauration du sens que la creation effectue d ouvrir le champ des possibles a une extension nouvelle   Creating does not mean producing an object an object provided with a matter and a form creating means conferring by this very production a new power to the mind a power capable by the instauration of meaning that creation effects of opening the field of possibilities to a new extension But as we have seen Audi himself note creation does not limit itself to the possible since to do so would be to restrict phenomena to the realm of the virtual as opposed to the actual a realm Audi has metaphorical y labeled paradise and from which one must fall in order to enact creation The work of art that also effects an ethical relation to self and others as well as between the author and reader inaugurates solidarity without ever closing off the ethical relation by making it changeless Such changelessness is the mark of the virtual and thus to establish a relationship at all is to acknowledge the need to remain within the actual the unredeemed and unredeemable situation that generates relationship in the first place As in Les Fleurs du Mal then there is in Le Spleen de Paris a resistance to conclusion and a frustration of attempts to approach the work systematical y or linearly Such are as I hope to have demonstrated key effects of the attempt to think and write beyond redemption As this verse and prose poetry yield a rich set of conceptual questions bringing the poetry closer to theoretical writing in some senses so too recent  The Fall Out of Redemption theoretical writing has veered from systematic approaches toward the fragmentary the tentative and the suggestive I turn now to conclude to JeanLuc Nancy and Giorgio Agamben s attempts to think within a theological structures but beyond the notion of redemption In this their work is in continuity with Baudelaire s own writing beyond salvation Nancy s recent writings on Christianity and its autodeconstruction can provide insight into the way theological discourse functions in Baudelaire whereas our excursions into Baudelaire s poetry can shed light on Nancy s ideas of the way Christian discourse is not simply surpassed or superceded but rather moves beyond itself while retaining something of the force of the theological As Aukje van Rooden explains in a description that resonates strongly with what we have demonstrated in Baudelaire regarding the interplay between the a theological and the ethical for Nancy the notion of poiesis provides a view not only of creation but also of community of our being together in the world which Nancy tries to understand as an act a praxis rather than as a fulfilled work or a closed figure van Rooden    One of the ideas that Nancy borrows from the traditional Christian register in order to show how it empties itself of its own religious content is that of adoration a concept that guides the second volume of his analysis of the deconstruction of Christianity The definitions that Nancy offers of adoration are multifaceted they open onto questions as a poem might rather than closing off the field of definition the way a systematic philosophy might seek to do Nancy returns to these sorts of characterizations of adoration several times in his book altering the focus and thus our conception of adoration a bit each time That multifaceted nature of his definitions is also a feature of adoration itself Adoration signals a relationship to a presence that it would be out of the question to bring here that must be known and affirmed as essential y elsewhere with the effect of opening the here It is therefore not a presence in the accepted sense of the word It is not the presence of anything in particular but that of the opening the dehiscence the breach or the breaking out of the here itself Adoration  Here we see Nancy s struggle with articulating a new meaning for familiar terms such as presence that would both surpass and retain the theological force of the concept In language that leans heavily on a philosophy or theology of negation Nancy establishes presence as a kind of pure presence that would be the presence of nothing that becomes opening itself Further in the text Nancy affirms that adoration simply means attention to the movement of sense to the possibility of an address that would be utterly new neither philosophical nor religious neither practical nor political nor loving but attentive   Nancy s suggestion of pure openness echoes the pure virtuality that for Paul Audi is the paradise from which we must fall in order to have an actuality at al  a fall epitomized for Audi by esthetic creation And so Baudelaire s poem on the theme of adoration Je t adore a l egal  which actualizes the fall from adoration into creation and its concomitant destruction can be read as an interhistorical reply to Nancy Nancy argues in Adoration in favor of maintaining the open by resisting attempts to fill the empty space left by Christianity upon its departure Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  Materialisms positivisms scientisms irrationalisms fascisms or collectivisms utilitarianisms individualisms historicisms legalisms and even democratisms without mentioning all the relativisms skepticisms logicisms all duly atheist will have been attempts more or less pitiful or frightening to occupy this place with greater or lesser dissimulation of the effort to do so for one had after al  become somewhat aware that this was not what needed to be done Such is stil  and on a renewed basis our responsibility to keep the place empty or better stil  perhaps to ensure that there shall be no more place for an instance or for a question of a reason given raison rendue  of foundation origin and end  Nancy s procession of isms recal s Cioran s condemnation of successive attempts to effect progress in humanity whether from scientific developments or political movements as well as Baudelaire s critique of progress It resonates too with Agamben s conception of the open It is not easy to think this figure whether new or very ancient of that life that shines in the saved night of nature s and in particular human nature s  eternal unsavable survival after it has definitively bid farewell to the logos and to its own history It is no longer human because it has perfectly forgotten every rational element every project for mastering its animal life but if animality had been defined precisely by its poverty in world and by its obscure expectation of a revelation and a salvation then this life cannot be called animal either It surely does not see the open in the sense that it does not appropriate it as an instrument of mastery and knowledge but neither does it remain simply closed in its own captivation Open    Commenting on this passage Colby Dickson reminds us that Agamben aims to restore humanity to its intended present moment not one in which the human subject as the centerpiece of Western rational thought would reign over all of creation but rather a present wherein the human animal might reappear in its originary environment Agamben   The present moment or moment of presence seems fated to move in Nancy and Agamben alike into a future or past whether it be the originary status evoked here by Dickson or the seemingly always deferred future moment when Nancy s empty place would truly be empty The conceptual restlessness that is revealed here suggests the trace or more than a trace of soteriological thinking whereby a kind of redemption is imagined even if it impossible to achieve or an impossibly innocent origin is conceived but in a way that is recognized to be non human in that such an originary state does not and cannot correspond to humanity as it is defined in actual lived postlapsarian existence Boyan Manchev has argued that Nancy is explicitly opposed to messianic rhetoric despite the fact that the project of deconstucting Christianity comprises many categories that imply a messianic horizon the event to come or the empty signal announcing it  Nancy is explicitly opposed to messianic rhetoric Thus in the  The Fall Out of Redemption opening to Concealed Thinking he writes For my part I remain reticent about the vocabulary of the messianic La pensee derobee n  Indeed Nancy presents himself as one of the major critics of messianic logic and therefore of negative ontologies Manchev  Being reticent about the messianic is not of course the same as successful y eliminating it from one s thought which is a move that many contemporary thinkers find as desirable as it is difficult to accomplish While Manchev is right that Nancy s negative ontology does not end in an absolute event   it nevertheless bears the mark of a look forward to redemption of the eternal y open or of the community that would be accomplished by poiesis a transposition of esthetic salvation to a newly invented and perhaps purely conceptual political one The Agamben of The Open is in fact more willing than Nancy to retain a notion of redemption since he contrasts the savable and the unsavable in terms of the question of relation to knowledge To articulate a zone of nonknowledge or better of aknowledge means not simply to let something be but to leave something outside of being to render it unsavable Open   Agamben implies here that to be is to be savable precisely the contrary of the relationship to knowledge that the other thinkers we have examined establish between redemption and knowledge For these others the realm of knowledge not nonknowledge is the one which renders the existent being unsavable and it is this condition of irredeemability that these writers have sought to come to terms with Agamben s notion of redemption is unrelated to a divinity but it is no less real and operative in his thought and especial y his political thought He defines redemption in The Coming Community as the irreparable loss of the lost the definitive profanity of the profane Coming   Colby Dickinson underscores that this conception of redemption requires not that we act in order to effectuate our redemption but rather that we refrain from acting What it singularly requires is that we stop creating the representations of ourselves and our bodies that continue to plague us and to weight us down as so much unnecessary baggage We are thereby called instead to let things appear as they already are in whatever form they present themselves This is to invoke a state that in effect removes salvation as traditional y characterized from us entirely There is nothing to be saved then because we have regressed beyond salvation we have been profaned We can have hope only in what is without remedy The innermost character of salvation is that we are saved only at the point when we no longer want to be At this point there is salvation but not for us Coming   Agamben  The notion of salvation existing but not for us resonates with Agamben s notion explored in chapter one of a pure salvation that would be salvation without an object a variation on asoteriological thinking that both retains and cancels the notion of salvation which by traditional definition must have an object of the action Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  There is thus no true attempt to move beyond the logic of redemption in Agamben but rather an explicit effort to redefine the concept in a way that steers clear both of a theistic account and of secular political moves toward an ideal Agamben s quasi messianic vision cannot but stand opposed to Nancy s attempt to keep open the space cleared by Christianity s autodeconstruction Any futureoriented thinking such as Agamben s notion of the coming community implies cannot help pulling back toward a teleological orientation even if one maintains that the coming of that community is infinitely deferred As Baudelaire and Cioran have helped us to see a thorough embedding in the present is the proper temporal orientation of asoteriology In that sense Nancy s approach gets us closer to a move beyond the logic of redemption In one of his more lyrical characterizations of adoration he claims it is nothing other than the movement of singing that comes to the throat and the lips for no reason from nowhere  The murmur and stammering of a celebration and an invocation of an exclamation that comes from before language and outlasts it A salutation without salvation which salutes existence a stranger to the opposition between the saved and the lost the blessed and the damned Adoration  Nancy s play on the French word salut which means both salutation and salvation accomplishes a crucial shift in thinking about redemption and a more promising way of moving beyond the logic of redemption by redefining it as an acknowledgement of the other in a present moment an acknowledgement that carries no trace of traditional theological redemption beyond the linguistic correspondence between the two terms in French By refusing to populate the space of the open with positive political content Nancy in effect shifts the terrain from the political to the ethical at the same time as he moves from the sacred to the immanent In this new world where the relations of men among themselves radical y take over from the common or collective relation to divine powers relation itself somehow comes to occupy the place of the sacred Adoration   Another of Nancy s definitions of adoration also underscores the importance of nontranscendent relation Adoration the movement and the joy of recognizing ourselves as existents in the world Not that this existence is not tough thankless shot through with grief Yet this grief is not the price we pay in order to reach another world It redeems nothing but at least we can insofar as we do not give up on living salute and name some beings from time to time To adore passes through naming saluting the unnameable that the name hides within it and that is nothing other than the fortuitousness of the world  Christina Smerick describes Nancy s approach to redemption in terms that directly echo Agamben s the kind of salvation indicated by Nancy and maintained in the face of criticism from Derrida and others is a salvation that saves nothing except that it  The Fall Out of Redemption saves us from believing in other worlds worlds we fantasize about escaping to if we could just believe correctly We need to be saved from belief particularly belief in salvation Smerick   Yet the direct echo of Agamben s notion of saving nothing fails to do justice to the real distance that Nancy takes from messianic thinking which neither Agamben nor Benjamin before him manages to effect It moves Nancy closer to the asoteriological thinking of Cioran and Baudelaire as evidenced by Smerick s contention that for Nancy we need to be saved from belief in salvation which echoes Cioran s assertion in De l inconvenient d etre ne which I cited in chapter four La certitude qu il n y a pas de salut est une forme de salut elle est meme le salut a partir de la on peut aussi bien organiser sa propre vie que construire une philosophie de l histoire L insoluble comme solution comme seule issue The certainty that there is no salvation is a form of salvation it is even salvation itself From there one can organize one s own life as well as construct a philosophy of history The insoluble as solution as the only way out Pl   This return to the terrain mapped out by Cioran reminds us of the difficulty of overcoming the logic of redemption as opposed to merely recharacterizing our definition of it By identifying this point of commonality between Cioran s thought and Nancy s we remain within the paradoxical situation outlined by Cioran s writings on redemption and already present in the passage just quoted the liberation from redemption characterized as itself a kind of redemption merely redefines the terms despite the author s desire to move beyond the category entirely When Nancy makes the move quoted above to defining adoration as the movement of recognizing ourselves as existents in a world shot through with grief that redeems nothing he joins Baudelaire in articulating what a life lived in full recognition of the impossibility of redemption would look like When Nancy shifts the terrain from saving to naming he does so in a way prefigured by Baudelaire in poems such as Hymne a la tres chere a la tres belle Qui remplit mon coeur de clarte a l ange a l idole immortelle Salut en l immortalite Elle se repand dans ma vie Comme un air impregne de sel Et dans mon ame inassouvie Verse le gout de l eternel Sachet toujours frais qui parfume L atmosphere d un cher reduit Encensoir oublie qui fume En secret a travers la nuit Comment amour incorruptible T exprimer avec verite Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  Grain de musc qui gis invisible Au fond de mon eternite a la tres bonne a la tres belle Qui fait ma joie et ma sante a l ange a l idole immortelle Salut en l immortalite OC  To the dearest fairest woman Who sets my heart ablaze with light To the angel the immortal idol Greetings in immortality She permeates my life Like air impregnated with salt And into my unsated soul Pours the taste for the eternal Sachet ever fresh that perfumes The atmosphere of a dear nook Forgotten censer smoldering Secretly through the night Everlasting love how can I Describe you truthful y Grain of musk that lies unseen In the depths of my eternity To the dearest fairest woman Who is my health and my delight To the angel the immortal idol Greetings in immortality  Read in conjunction with the passage from Nancy this poem seems almost an illustration of it Baudelairean adoration passes through naming while remaining unable actually to name thus saluting the unnameable that the name hides within it The woman is never quite equivalent to the terms used to describe her which pass from the plausible idole through the comparative comme un air through the metaphorical sachet and grain de musc The woman is reduced to an odor a weightless sensual property which is noticed and then passes away leaving the gout de l eternel to remain unfulfilled in this poem that never actually enacts any kind of transcendence and whose salut can be read simultaneously as a greeting and a bidding farewell The lack of contact in the poem preserves the woman since the adoration featured in Hymne is markedly different from the one in Je t adore a l egal precisely  The Fall Out of Redemption because in the latter poem contact is established a contact whose violent encounter destroys the life of the woman in order to produce cette froideur par ou tu m es plus belle that coldness which makes you more beautiful OC   These two prototypical encounters in Les Fleurs du Mal become transformed in Le Spleen de Paris to a different kind of ethical relation midway between the adorationwithoutcontact of Hymne and the intimate contact that destroys the object in Je t adore a l egal  a relation marked by what Steinmetz described as noncommunication between men Steinmetz   This relation permits encounter without sacrifice of its object a new model based even more solidly in a notion of original sin that prevents on account of the solidarity that could only be broken by a logic of redemption that divides the saved from the damned a unilateral destruction of an object In Nancy s move to an ethics of relation he renders his philosophy in some sense consonant with pessimism as it has been characterized by Joshua Foa Dienstag for whom pessimism is what used to be called an ethic and what today might be called a technique of the self or a form of life More modestly pessimism is a philosophical sensibility from which political practices can be derived It is a proposed stance from which to grapple with a world that we now recognize as disordered and disenchanted It includes judgments about history and the possible course of our civilization but it is not real y a detailed set of predictions about future politics or economics Pessimism s goal is to edify us about our condition and to fortify us for the life that lies ahead Dienstag xi Pessimism thus carves a space for ethical relation by identifying common ground for humanity in its boundedness to time Here Baudelaire s notion of original sin joins Cioran s reflections on the fall into time and Nancy s philosophy of recognition of existence in an unredeemable world This interhistorical reading which links Nancy s most recent writings to Baudelaire s emphasizes the importance of the relation to the other that emerges not despite but rather on account of the refusal of redemption and the need to draw all of the attendant consequences It is a relation that Jacques Derrida also aligns with JeanLuc Nancy at the very end of his book on him And let it be blessed like a benediction still unthinkable an exasperated benediction a benediction accorded to his exasperated consent and in accordance with it a benediction without any hope of salvation an exhopedfor exespere salve an incalculable unpresentable salutation in advance renouncing Salvation as should any salute worthy of the name  Just salut greeting without salvation just a salut on the way Un salut sans salvation un salut juste a venir Touching  In Derrida s closing remark we see all the ambiguity of the notion of salvation and especial y the difficulty of doing away with it For what is the status of the ex in Asoteriological Ethics Baudelaire and Nancy  the exespere The hope is clearly not simply relegated to the past since it is also a venir an expression that brings back nearly the full force of the messianic which is precisely the category one would try to surpass when reorienting salut as greeting rather than salvation The very nature of the French language makes it impossible for any philosopher deeply attuned to language to separate salvation and greeting in the word salut and adoration as wel  as in the ceremony known as le salut du saint sacrement  To arrive at just salut it would need to always be on the way eternal y deferred and thus awaited which is the etymological root of esperer which returns us to the domain of hope that Derrida and Nancy had presumably attempted to move beyond an attempt which is I would claim ultimately a failed one Baudelaire comes closer in his encounter without communion in his complicity that is not even a greeting to reorienting a conception of human encounter away from redemption showing along the way how such a distancing also facilitates the esthetic and ethical relation while rejecting it is true any notion of community whether actual or like Nancy s and Agamben s always to come Notes Introduction  For more on the history of the term incurvatus in se in the context of a contemporary theological account of sin see Jenson  See for instance Elevation OC    I borrow the term interhistorical from Hilary Thompson See Time and Its Countermeasures   De Maistre et Edgar Poe m ont appris a raisonner OC   Chapter   Compagnon s own list of characteristics of the antimoderns does include those categories however counterrevolution antiEnlightenment pessimism original sin the sublime vituperation   Strictly speaking then Baudelaire might not fulfill Compagnon s criteria and Compagnon s study includes chapters on nineteenth century figures such as Chateaubriand de Maistre and Renan but not on Baudelaire Stil  as I will argue it is the originality of Baudelaire s kind of antimodernity as opposed to that of these other figures that he occupies such a crucial position in the modern antimodern plane  See Pichois note in Baudelaire OC  n  For example Histoire de ma traduction d Edgar Poe Histoire des Fleurs du mal humiliation par le malentendu et mon proces Story of my translation of Edgar Poe Story of the Fleurs du mal humiliation by misunderstanding and my trial OC    See Jacques Derrida s remarks on aphorism Un aphorisme authentique ne doit jamais renvoyer a un autre Mais qu on le veuille ou non qu on le voie ou non des aphorismes s enchainent ici comme aphorismes et en nombre numerotes Leur serie se plie a un ordre irreversible Lecteur visiteur au travail An authentic aphorism must never refer to another But whether we want it or not whether we see it or not aphorisms link up here as aphorisms and in number numbered Their series folds to an irreversible order Reader visitor to work Psyche    Sylvain David recognizes a similar pattern in Emil Cioran who defines the absolute via reference to Baudelaire s L heautontimoroumenos Beyond doubt remains a wil  if not a need to believe If one cannot hope to reassume one day an innocent and original faith in the universe the possibility remains of flight forward  Besides this exercise of dangerous intellect seems to correspond to certain esthetic practices of modernity I am the wound and the knife there is our absolute our infinity David   Notes   Critchley situates Freud within a line of postChristian attempts to think through original sin A more complex case is that of Heidegger Heidegger s ideas of thrownness facticity and falling were explicitly elaborated in connection with Luther s conception of original sin and the anthropology of the primal Christianity in Paul It is a phenomengical y refined conception of original sin that allows Heidegger to explain the endless human propensity towards evasion and flight from taking responsibility for oneself Although such a responsibility can be momentarily achieved in authentic resoluteness it can never arrest the slide back into inauthenticity The concept of original sin is still very much with us Critchley    For John Gray a notable shift from pessimism to an unlikely optimism has been the mark of contemporary neoconservativism in sharp contrast to thinkers such as de Maistre Neoconservatives have been distinguished by their belligerent optimism which links them with a powerful utopian current in Enlightenment thinking and with the Christian fundamentalist faith that evil can be defeated Black   Likewise Gray dismisses descriptions of George W Bush s politics as Manichean The followers of Mani were subtle thinkers who accepted that evil could never be eliminated Talk of ending evil is no more Manichean than it is Augustinian It is an expression of Christian postmillennialism which harks back to the belief of the first Christians that the blemishes of human life can be wiped away in a benign catastrophe    Cf Agamben s comments in The Signature of Al Things about creation and redemption not being separate but rather they persist in a single place where the work of salvation acts as a kind of a priori that is immanent in the work of creation and makes it possible    Francoise Meltzer has offered a critique of de Man s position arguing that the present for Baudelaire acts as a place from which to see the past on the one hand and the future on the other not as interdependent but as endlessly irrevocably noncontiguous T he moment in Baudelaire is the position from which the past and the future irrevocably reassert themselves the present is the place that allows for this realization and that place is the lived moment Meltzer    Tomoko Masuzawa provides a Benjaminian reading of this poem and concludes that the singular achievement of Baudelaire as Benjamin seems to assess it lies in the particular form in which these two orders of time Erlebnis and Erfahrung are final y col apsed not mediated not chosen between    This selftormented consciousness has much in common with the Augustinian notion of sin as man s condition of being incurvatus in se See Jenson for an analysis of the legacy of this idea in Christian theology  See also Le Squelette laboureur Skeleton with a Spade and its skepticism about neant and repose after death Voulezvous Montrer que dans la fosse meme Le sommeil promis n est pas sur Qu envers nous le Neant est traitre Que tout meme la Mort nous ment Et que sempiternellement Helas il nous faudra peutetre Dans quelque pays inconnu Ecorcher la terre reveche Et pousser une lourde beche Sous notre pied sanglant et nu Do you wish To show that even in the grave None is sure of the promised sleep That Annihilation betrays us That al  even Death lies to us And that forever and ever Alas we shall be forced perhaps In some unknown country To scrape the hard and stony ground And to push a heavy spade in With our bare and bleeding feet  OC    Notes  Debarati Sanyal argues that in this poem as in Baudelaire s poetry general y irony is continual y reframed in a context disclosing the underlying violence of acts of knowing the self and the other a move that gives rise to irony as counterviolence to the traumatic shock of the modern    On this paratext reprinted in OC   see William Olmstead who argues that the note allows us to gain a privileged view of how Baudelaire restaged earlier poetry to suit his changed religious and political views allowing him to dramatiz e evil at once sympathetical y and judgmental y Olmstead    See OC   I analyze this poem in more detail in Chapter   Here my interpretation differs from that of Claude Pichois for whom Peter s denial is an act not of cowardice but of vengeance since Pichois associates the remorse in the poem with Christ s supposed regret at having duped mankind Peter thus becomes according to Pichois a man whose eyes were opened OC   My interpretation turns on questions of knowledge or consciousness as wel  but of a very different subject namely the inability of Jesus or anyone to cancel inaction by carrying out revolt to the bitter end  As Jonathan Culler has noted the devil plays an ambiguous role throughout Baudelaire s collection What happens in the opening poem happens in the collection as a whole the poems with an important framing function claim that the Devil is ubiquitous but subsequent poems do not tell us whether the scenes or movements they narrate are examples of the Devil s work Culler   Chapter   Steiner  My comments on Benjamin s intended structure for the Baudelaire book draw on Steiner s descriptions  See also Jacobs exploration of the persistence of redemption in Benjamin s later work as well In Benjamin s work from beginning to end ironical y this complicity and interchangeability of a banal concept of redemption with that of the Fall is at play This is what takes place in Towards the Image of Proust for example where Benjamin s reader might be lured into finding either a nostalgia for a lost past in a temporality of fall or a celebration of its recuperation as redemption What takes place instead is the production of the dialectical image Jacobs    On the question of fashion in the Arcades Project see Richard Wolin whose remarks indicate that Benjamin ultimately situates fashion as a manifestation of the alwaysthesame rather than a potential y redemptive break from sameness Benjamin s object was to demonstrate the manner in which the alwaysthesame of prehistory manifests itself in the modern insofar as the modern manifests itself as the always thesame The purpose of this intention was not to attempt to discover rudiments of archaic life in the modern per se but rather to unmask the idea of the modern itself ie the idea of an endless stream of consumer goods or fashion as that of eternal recurrence or the alwaysthesame Wolin    PopCurseu identifies diverging engagement with Nietzsche on the part of Benjamin and Fondane as wel  but goes on to note Benjamin s comment in Central Park  The heroic in Baudelaire is always the sublime form under which the demonic Notes  manifests itself and spleen manifests its vile and barbarous form as one that Fondane himself could have written in his book on Baudelaire PopCurseu    Olivier SalazarFerrer rightly questions however the potential blindness of Fondane s position when it comes to the political stakes of a philosophy of antirational action His plea for a return to myth and an affective participation in the real his critique of the idea of culture and his attack on the rationalism inherited from the Enlightenment place him in a delicate situation in the ideological landscape of the s when Fascism was attracted to these ideas Fondane    Ramona Fotiade identifies the roots of this view in the writings of Lev Chestov who argues that knowledge as opposed to life brought about a need for certainty  More accurately knowledge introduced a rational dimension into language and implicitly into experience  which underpins any theory of meaning as ideal meaning or meaninginitself constituted independently of the variable conditions of experience and of the thinking subject s existence Fotiade    For analysis of Fondane s views of the fall in comparison with those of Andre Breton s and in light of the critique of surrealism that Fondane advances see Fotiade    And if Baudelaire deserved his life If contrary to commonplaces men only ever had the life they deserved Sartre    Fondane s epigraph reads L ivresse de l art est plus propre que toute autre a jeter un voile sur les terreurs du gouffre BEG   The exact quotation from Baudelaire is L ivresse de l Art est plus apte que toute autre a voiler les terreurs du gouffre OC    Divorcing God from reason leaves Fondane with a conception of an irrational tyrannical God that chimes with some of Baudelaire s references to a divinity who takes pleasure in human suffering As Olivier SalazarFerrer summarizes in his analysis of Fondane Arbitrary and incomprehensible beyond good and evil it is a terrible God who can only be approached through trial He is the God of Job and of the sacrifice of Isaac by Abraham or the one of the scandalous Christ chasing the merchants from the temple and who dies abandoned on the cross All social religion with its dogmas prohobitions rituals and forms of collective life will be foreign to him Fondane    Ramona Fotiade summarizes the relationship between the fal  knowledge and freedom as both Chestov and Fondane theorize it Death is inscribed in the Knowledge of Good and Evil and initiates a drive for knowledge that remains at all times opposed to the principle of Life In contrast to the philosophy of the finitude of being which places man under the imperative of the Law and defines his existence in relation to death Chetsov and Fondane advance the project of a philosophy of Life which is also a philosophy of unlimited freedom Fotiade     On this passage in Baudelaire and its sources in Augustine and Pascal see Starobinski Notes   Starobinski affirms that far from being a delusional plan of Baudelaire s the fine conspiracy would be the scenario of one of his nightmares  and that we need to read belle ironical y here as Baudelaire uses it thus in many other instances in his journals  For another characterization of the gouffre in Fondane see SalazarFerrer Resulting from the melting of the rational foundation of the whole of our certitudes the gouffre designates the sudden consciousness of the il usion of the whole of our rational and idealist convictions It appears in particular when the values of the good the  Notes true and the beautiful melt away and with them the comfort of Stoic Christian or nineteenthcentury progressive moralities This melting happens for Fondane under the power of traumatic events that do not integrate in logics of consolation or justification Fondane    Chapter   For a more detailed analysis of this idea see Clemens    Colby Dickson notes that according to Agamben poetry becomes an atheological enterprise because it must reinvent the way in which theology has been understood from its inception as an attempt to speak the truth of language s origin a truth which language itself cannot state Poetic    Aggeler s translation does not reproduce the alteration in punctuation  For more details see OC    For a fuller reading of this poem see my Baudelaire with Badiou  I analyze the way the nous vous opposition functions here in more detail in Resonance accord voyage  Jean Starobinski links L heautontimoroumenos to L irremediable by way of the kind of selfreflexive consciousness that prevents both consciousness and poetry from coming to an end About the latter poem Starobinski writes Consciousness of Evil is the result of all allegorical images that prefigure it And at the same time it sends us back to what was the first word of the poem An Idea as if a circle was beginning again and if the irremediable aspect of melancholy destined the fall repeat itself indefinitely La melancolie   Chapter   See also Weller s analysis of this passage    Peter Sloterdijk provides an amusing but apt characterization of Cioran s compositional process He produces books by compiling the text provided by his inner employees They present their material in irregular sessions aphorisms from the blasphemy department observations from the misanthropy studio gibes from the disil usionment section proclamations from the press office of the circus of the lonely theses from the agency for swinging on the edge and poisons from the editorial office for the despisal of contemporary literature Formulating the thought of suicide is the only job that remains in the chief editor s hands this involves the practice on which all further sequences of repetition depend    Aurelien Demers summarizes Cioran s view as follows Nothing and no one can save us because we are necessarily alone and God can only be a monstrous nothingness or a monster of annihilation  Far from being a solution salvation just like God transfigures itself or defigures itself in its opposite Demers    Cf Simona Modreanu s remark that for Cioran the religious cannot be a question of content but only of intensity Cioran   In a letter Cioran cal s prayer a temptation and an impossibility an unrealizable necessity Cioran and Guerne   Notes   Cioran makes a similar comment in an interview Ce sont les deux Francais auxquels je pense le plus J ai cesse de les lire il y a tres longtemps mais je pense plus que de raison a Baudelaire et a Pascal Tout le temps je me refere a eux je me sens une sorte d affinite souterraine avec eux Those are the two Frenchmen of whom I think the most often I stopped reading them a very long time ago but I think more than is reasonable about Baudelaire and Pascal All the time I refer to them I feel a sort of underground affinity with them E    A negative heroism though in that the hero of a universal of the fall or decomposition does not have to fight against an exterior peril but on the contrary enters into conflict with his own interiority Already Walter Benjamin inspired by Baudelaire considered that modernity had produced its own exemplary or heroic figures with the lesbian the prostitute the Apache or the suicide since rather than use up their strength to fight in the name of a cause or an ideal these deviant types represented in his eyes the quintessence of inversion and selfdestruction Cioran takes up in his own way this idea of personal sacrifice of a vain exploit but at a strictly individual level contrary to the models retained by Benjamin  he aspires less to destroy himself physical y than to demolish systematical y in himself the least idea image or il usion that he could have in common with his contemporaries From his point of view the only heroic gesture still possible to modern man is that exemplary one of thinking against oneself TE  David    See A une heure du matin At One O Clock in the Morning   OC    While Cioran often identifies salvation as the most problematic doctrine of Christianity he also implicates another foundational notion incarnation which he sees as yielding an unjustified hubris that aligns itself to Western notions of progress in the modern period L Incarnation est la flatterie la plus dangereuse dont nous ayons ete l objet Elle nous aura dispense un statut demesure hors de proportion avec ce que nous sommes En haussant l anecdote humaine a la dignite de drame cosmique le christianisme nous a trompes sur notre insignifiance il nous a precipites dans l il usion dans cet optimisme morbide qui au mepris de l evidence confond cheminement et apotheose Plus reflechie l Antiquite paienne mettait l homme a sa place The Incarnation is the most dangerous flattery of which we have been the object It will have given us an immoderate status out of proportion with what we are By raising the human anecdote to the dignity of cosmic drama Christianity has fooled us about our insignificance it had led us into il usion into that morbid optimism which against the evidence confuses progression with apotheosis Pl     As Modreanu writes Being unable to adhere to a spontaneous yes or a tortured no Cioran first adopts a logic then a sort of metaphysics of the excluded middle founded on the voluptuousness of the contradiction and a certain nobility of lamentation that dilutes its tears in the subtleties of paradox Cioran    Such a view of messianism as an informing structural principle allows us to go beyond moments when messianism is a thematic concern of Cioran s which he associates with less complex concepts such as his critique of progress Le Messie a venir le vrai on comprend qu il tarde a se manifester La tache qui l attend n est pas aisee comment s y prendraitil pour delivrer l humanite de la manie du mieux The Messiah to come the true one we understand that he is late showing himself The task awaiting him is not easy how would he go about delivering humanity from the mania of the best Pl    Notes Chapter   As Aurelien Demers has noted Cioran proposes three potential ways to escape from the consequences of the fal  those of the child the primitive person and the insane All of these states are states of unconsciousness though so as long as a human subject is ful y conscious the effects of the fall remain operative See Demers   Simona Modreanu is right to advocate a balanced approach to Cioran s problematic political engagement in his early years First these facts are undeniable and hagiographical attempts at obscuring these realities of Cioran s past by certain critics especial y Romanian ones are at least as harmful as the relentlessness deploted by certain others especial y French ones to place him among the accused of history Cioran    If Cioran refuses the idea of progress he also rejects the idea that the modern period has seen an escalation of catastrophe He writes in a letter in  What I noticed is that people may understand the horror of the modern world but not the horror of the world itself which is at the Heart of my fears and which even though I am an unbeliever makes me hold monasticism in such esteem Cioran and Guerne    In an analysis that echoes Audi s discussion of potentiality and creation William Watkin points out that according to Agamben one common feature of both literature and philosophy is that both seem to founder on an aporia between potentiality and actuality See his analysis of the productive negation at stake in both poetry and philosophy in Watkin   See Francois Raffoul s commentary on this passage as it relates to larger questions of Nancy s philosophy of world and the deconstruction of Christianity Raffoul    One remarkable effect of this always already occurring fall is however an ability to read and understand Cioran s aphorisms which depend on irony According to Simona Modreanu To understand a Cioran text one has to have already understood it The jenesaisquoi of irony answers a kind of precomprehension always already present in the receiver Dieu    For analyses of Cioran s relationship to gnosticism see Modreanu Dieu   and Jerome Laurent    Michel Jarrety identifies Cioran s passion of undeliverance and its concomitant suffering as a sensation of being and a sign of election Jarrety   a sign of the speaking subject s quasiRomantic tragic superiority  Cf a similar passage where Cioran invokes his simultaneous lucidity and delusion Un enfant des enfants tous incapables de voir ce que vous seul avez vu vous le plus detrompe des mortels sans aucune il usion sur autrui et sur soi Mais vous en garderez une malgre tout celle tenace inderacinable de croire ne point en posseder A child all of them children unable to see what only you have seen you the most il usionfree of mortals without any il usion about others and yourself But you will keep one even so the tenacious unuprootable il usion of not having any Pl   Patrice Bollon underscores the permanent coexistence of lucidity and delusion in Cioran the demand for the most il uminating lucidity and the need for the most obscurantist il usion the search for wisdom and acquiescence to the most vile drives a mystical movement toward holiness and attachment to the most atheistic materialism  As if the affirmer and negator coexisted in him permanently and about all things Bollon   Notes   For an insightful reading of the way Cioran cultivates rather than refuses paradox see David    One should perhaps add that the impermanence of salvation is also related to the impermanence of ideas in Cioran s writing which Edward Said identifies as a source of suffering What makes him suffer particularly he thinks is his incapacity to happen Like Rameau s Nephew he sees the world and his writing thus expresses a series of positions taken but only provisional y Ineluctably the difficulties he encounters make him return to a consciousness of the impasse of writing itself Said    Sylvie Jaudeau cal s this the lucidity of the last man in Cioran In a magesterial inversion fallen man can pride himself on the incomparable privilege of living in full consciousness of his mortal destiny Characterized by lucidity his consciousness forgets the il usions immanent in time and reconsiders history while depriving it of its aura It envisages it from the perspective of the last man that new species which has ceased to confuse becoming and absolute and to make historical time sacred as the ancients did by rendering it complicit with the atemporal or with a transcendent absolute that they placed in paradise the end of time or other utopias Jaudeau     For a discussion of pessimism and disappointment in Cioran see Acquisto Epistemologic  Je disais l autre jour a un ami que tout en ne croyant plus a l ecriture je ne voudrais pas y renoncer que travailler etait une il usion defendable et qu apres avoir gribouille une page ou seulement une phrase j avais toujours envie de siffler I was saying the other day to a friend that even while no longer believing in writing I did not want to renounce it that working was a defensible il usion and that after having scribbled a page or only a sentence I always had a desire to whistle O   Chapter   Bersani offers a critique of Walter Benjamin on precisely the grounds that even in his weak version of messianism art itself gets reduced to a kind of superior patching function   See also Kathleen KerrKoch s discussion of aspects of Benjamin s work that leave the readers apprehensive in particular in the way that he appropriates material from strong and systematic but political y dangerous thinkers and uses them for his own purposes The question as to what extent Benjamin s work becomes complicit with the atrocities of the time however is certainly a real one     Audi also evokes Benjamin Fondane s book on Baudelaire which can be not to say should be considered as one of the most important contributions to esth ethic theory that we have ever received from the past    On deconstruction as textual messianism see Reynolds  See  Corinthians   Simon Critchley also appropriates the notion of the as not for an atheistic faith See Faith    For an insightful reading that identifies political potential in the violence and ethical irony of the prose poems see Sanyal    As Richard Burton notes The very fact that Assommons les pauvres can be plausibly interpreted either as an incitement to revolutionary violence in a leftwing protoMarxist sense or as a nihilistic reductio ad absurdum of all forms of leftism already locates it at or close to the point where the opposition between left and right ceases to be operable    Francoise Meltzer comments In Assommons we are witness to a theological and political strabismus as if the poet were remembering Proudhon s social theories with one eye and reading Maistre on original sin with the other Such recording is not an attempt to write modernity it is rather a reeling a pitching    On Proudhon and Assommons les pauvres see Murphy    See though Hiddleston s reading of Le miroir which sees evidence of the poet s emphasis on original sin at work in this poem as well he has a right to regard his ugliness by whatever standard that moral ugliness itself may desire and not in the light of the truly immortal principle of original sin which defines man s places both in time and society There can be no point in such a selfexamination since it will lead to no change in the individual it is as if the Devil had turned into Narcissus in a world where mirrors do not have the kindness to shatter     Smerick recognizes this refusal of salvational logic earlier in her essay Nancy does not suggest salvation or certainly not the sort of salvation the Western mentality has come to expect no spitcurled Superman will fly in from another world no spirit penetrates flesh in order to redeem it for eternity  In fact those sorts of rescue fantasies may be what destroy us for they suggest a power play by some Other who will save us al  and thus they col apse again into dominance and unity    There are resonances here with Georges Bataille s analysis of the way the definitive end of divine immanence brings about a state in which destruction in the herebelow is always creative As a consequence of that end of immanence production alone is accessible and worthy of interest herebelow the principle of nonproductive destruction is given only in the beyond and it cannot have any value for the here below Theory    Introduction Imagining Cioran Imagining the author is part of any reading experience For the translator even more than for the ordinary reader the author or that fiction named Author is a personal obsession Like Jacob who wrestled a mysterious being all night long the translator struggles silently with the author until he blesses him or lets him go Like Jacob he wants to know his opponent to see him face to face is haunted physically and spiritually by the authors face his name his strength his style So I struggled with Cioran and for a long time I imagined him like a spirit conjured up from the lines of his text as from a witchs brew a leonine head Zarathustras voice dramatic poses alternating between those of a biblical prophet and a Western dandy Above all I saw him as frightfully young and precocious with an uncanny affinity for suffering and a diabolical propensity for selftorture an enfant terrible full of somber and cruel vitality dangerously playing at philosophy toying with poisonous and lethal thoughts But my Cioran has a historical dimension still recoverable from a nottoodistant past He is a young intellectual from Romanias politically troubled interwar period Along with Eugene lonesco the absurdist playwright and member of the Academic franfaise and Mircea Eliade the philosopher and historian of religions he participated in Romanias cultural Renaissance during the s He belonged to Romanias Young Generation her angry young men who in Matei Calinescus words represented a generation whose creed was based on the primacy of youth over old age youth being equated with spiritual fervor authenticity creativity idealism while old age symbolized routine inertia political corruption and petty materialism As Calinescu points out  the year when On the Heights of Despair was first published was one of the high points of the s in Romania Eliade published five books among them a study in religious anthropology which contains the main ideas of The Forge and the Crucible   and lonesco published his only major Romanian book a volume of deconstructive literary criticism titled No Though younger than either Eliade or lonesco Cioran was no less interesting His intense personality invited fictionalizing early in his life Calinescu for example recognizes an early portrait of the young Cioran in the character of tefan Parlea the name suggests conflagration from Mihail Sebastians novel For Two Thousand Years where he is the author of an essay provocatively titled Invocation for an Invasion of the Barbarians as Soon as Possible He embodies the nihilisticapocalyptic sensibilities of the young generation of Romanian intellectuals It was hard for me to reconcile my fictional Cioran with his historical origins The voice which in On the Heights of Despair vehemently denounces Christianity and the man who wrote the startling essay The Flight from the Cross clash with the image of the reallife Cioran son of a Romanian Orthodox priest He was born in the Transylvanian mountain village of Ra inari famous in Romania not only for its natural beauty but also as the home and the final resting place of other cultural figures of national renown the poet Octavian Goga and the enlightened Orthodox bishopscholar of Transylvania Andrei aguna As a young teenager I once passed through Ciorans village The idyllic village with its stonepaved uneven streets and ancient peasant houses was like a place out of time an enchanted mythical site A mysterious richness hung about it entrancing heavy and luminous like the golden glow of the silent summer afternoon I spent in its gardens and orchards And I know now that on my way to the cemetery to visit Bishop agunas tomb I passed Ciorans family house It was my first unwitting encounter with him who has been for the last few years my private obsessive fiction and to whom in my linguistic struggle I have clung like Jacob to his angel I am no Jacob and Cioran is no angel except perhaps a sly one of the devils party But for as long as I have known of his existence he has been hard to grab hold of and impossible to pin down When I was a student in Romania in the s and s he was a mysterious almost mythological presence One would hear that such a person existed but it was impossible to read him His French books were neither sold nor published in translation and his Romanian books had disappeared without a trace the rarest of rare books Although he had departed his homeland some ten years before the war and the Communist takeover he was as invisible as the most unspeakable or unnameable of nonpersons When I came to America in the late s I found that he was well known in elite intellectual circles though he remained as elusive and mysterious as ever His Romanian books are still literally rare available only from special collections The present book is the first translation of Cioran from his native language into English At last I have got hold of him and for at least the space of one translation that most provisional of arts I have pinned him down for others to see and read Granted he is a specialized taste too sharp and bitter for many palates and paradoxically too lyrical and funny for some others Yet Sartre has always had a large following in English and Cioran is in my estimation a better pure writer than Sartre or any of the postwar French existentialists His stylistic incisiveness has led some French critics to put him in the same class as Paul Valery an ultimate accolade of linguistic purity But the shocking bracing verve of his existential despair and good humor admits his philosophical prose to the company of Nietzsche and Kierkegaard As I tried to imagine my Cioran I kept replaying in my mind that day of long ago when I first brushed by his invisible presence and I wondered how I could relate my nihilisticapocalyptic Cioran to the details I still remembered so well the mountain air shimmering with hues of gold and green and blue the still heavy yet happy torpor of a slumbering summer day in a remote village where the only sign of activity was the buzz of lazy drones on leaves of grass And was it my Cioran that I had almost touched or just a ghost he had long left behind whose name was only secretively whispered in Romania for the past twentyfive years Instead of an answer to my puzzlement I found in Ciorans own writing a confirmation of the irredeemable incompatibility I sensed between the place and the man In The Temptation to Exist   he writes about his origins The paradox of being    a Romanian is a torrent one must know how to exploit    Hating my people my country its timeless peasants enamoured of their own torpor and almost bursting with hebetude I blushed to be descended from them    Unable to shove them aside or to animate them I came to the point of dreaming of an extermination In a lighter vein when I first visited him last summer he also recalled as a confirmation of this incompatibility between himself and his origins a humorous family anecdote concerning the scandal stirred up in his remote native region by his first nihilistic book On the Heights of Despair His father a priest and his mother head of the Christian Womens League kept a very low profile and weathered the storm by hiding in the house with the lights off and going to bed very early for weeks on end A reader of Ciorans entire oeuvre easily gets caught up in the game of making and unmaking authorial fictions for the reallife Cioran has two lives two identities two authorial voices In  he won a student fellowship and left Romania for Paris never to return He wrote only in French thereafter As I have already said Cioran is little known in Romania outside intellectual circles which have kept his name alive underground While his fame grew steadily in the West from the moment his first French book Precis de decomposition was published in  a quarter century of Romanias Communist cultural policies managed to erase all the traces he had left behind in his native country where he published several works The recent Romanian revolution has allowed a Cioran revival toward which Cioran himself has mixed feelings Modest and unassuming though winner of the Prix Combat and acclaimed as the greatest French writer to honor our language since the death of Paul Valery St John Perse and the most distinguished figure in the tradition of Kierkegaard Nietzsche and Wittgenstein Susan Sontag  Cioran has always shunned fame He regards it as an ambiguous blessing and prefers anonymity as a guarantor of freedom even when the freedom he seems to aspire to most is that of walking undisturbed in the Luxembourg gardens The Romanian Cioran of the s is different from but related to the French and much better known Cioran of the later decades By reading the younger Romanian Cioran we discover as another of his translators put it what he has kept and what he has discarded the old man of his youth and the new man he became after his encounter with the French language The themes of Ciorans work are the themes of modern and postmodern Western civilization despair and decay absurdity and alienation futility and the irrationality of existence the need for total lucidity and selfawareness and consciousness as agony On the Heights of Despair Ciorans first published work foreshadows the main themes of his later philosophical essays and is highly significant as the original sourcespring of this modern philosophical writers thought The French Cioran is a Nietzsche distilled through Chamfort a Job tamed at the school of the moralists an elegant and ironic stylist who has curbed the fiery lyricism of his youth with moral aphorisms because he knows that a moralists first duty is to depoetize his prose Le mauvais demiurge   My Cioran by contrast at the time he was writing On the Heights of Despair in  is only twentytwo years old a Nietzsche still complete with his Zarathustra his poses his mystical clowns tricks a whole circus of the heights Syllogismes de Iamertume   His display of hysteria his confession of failure his despair and lucid suffering also echo Dostoyevskys man from underground revealing Cioran as a young iconoclast from Europes eastern margins spitefully spouting fire and brimstone from his Balkan holeintheground a visionary of apocalypse a lover of paroxysms a theoretician of despair an untamed Job similar to the one he portrayed in his last Romanian book Tears and Saints Job is cosmic lamentations and weeping willows    open wounds of nature and of the soul    and a human heart Gods open wound The existence of a reallife author complicates the game of authorial fictionmaking As I fashioned my Cioran I longed to meet the reallife Cioran because like Jacob I wanted his blessing but also because I felt that he would not be complete until I met him in flesh and blood I knew that the reallife eightyyear old Cioran would be very different from my youthful authorial fiction but I looked forward to the clash of images as something essential and fulfilling in line with all the contradictions impishly cultivated in Ciorans work Whenever I imagined my Cioran I hoped that the reallife Cioran though close to eighty would be a young old man I was not disappointed In his modest Paris apartment imaginatively improvised out of the attic of an old building on the Left Bank where until recently there was no elevator he emerged from an enormous clutter of towering books and led me through a narrow passage with a low ceiling and an uneven floor to an unexpectedly sunny room with a cheerful garden suspended from its terrace Cioran looked frail but misleadingly so as I discovered when he told me that he preferred to ignore the new elevators in his building or when stepping out briskly he took me on his favorite walk through the Luxembourg gardens When he talked his clear green eyes flashed from under thick eyebrows their penetrating glare transfixing me to the chair while his jaw pushed forward with youthful determination and the old man was miraculously transformed into the young man I knew my Cioran But the fascinating contradiction remained for the young man spoke like an old man and when I asked what he was writing he answered that he no longer wrote because I dont want to slander the universe anymore Ive done it long enough dont you think so Yes this seemed to be the new Cioran professing that he is through with writing and that he has exhausted calumny so different from my young Cioran whose first book was brimming over with blasphemy And yet hearing him talk humorously and vivaciously another contradiction coming from a writer of gloomy aphorisms I could not help feeling that I may not have been dealing with the reallife Cioran as much as with another fiction a new persona and that he will soon take us by surprise yet another time for he is a master of dramatic effects who has been described as both candid and diabolical by the Italian writer Pietro Citati and as the last dandy by the Spanish philosopher Fernando Savater If fictionalizing the author is part of any reading experience an exercise of the imagination which varies in degrees of importance depending on the book it becomes a central issue in reading On the Heights of Despair where the author deliberately invents a fictional self through rhetorical artifices and theatrical gestures in order to save his real self Written in a moment of crisis when he was helplessly and desperately insomniac the book is a substitute for suicide and represents its cure Its title makes a direct allusion to suicide notices placed in contemporary Romanian newspapers of the period which invariably opened with the same formula On the heights of despair young soandso took his life    A rather pompous sounding phrase on the heights of despair thus came to be recognized as a sort of generic rationale for all suicides Using the cliche ironically Cioran casts himself in the role of what I would call the young barbarian or the beast of the Apocalypse who with a blood and tearstained face uttering a savage cry of revolt and despair from the heart of his semiOriental Balkans hangs over the abyss of existential nausea By casting himself in this character Cioran commits suicide metaphorically while managing to survive the call of death by releasing through his invented character the surplus of lyrical energy surging in him The terrifying experience and obsession of death when preserved in consciousness becomes ruinous If you talk about death you save part of yourself But at the same time something of your real self dies because objectified meanings lose the actuality they have in consciousness The impulse to write in order to free himself of his obsessions has always motivated Ciorans work As he put it in a recent interview with Savater Writing is for me a form of therapy nothing more Like the young Goethe of the Sturm und Drang period who invented the suicidal Werther in order to survive a personal crisis Cioran also creates a character out of his anguished self But unlike Goethe for whom Werther was a private demon he managed to exorcise so well that he did not suffer at all a mere accident in a career so limpid and devoid of sublime or sordid secrets that it is discouraging Cioran who confesses he has no organ of feeling for Goethe Syllogismes de Iamertume   sees his destiny as inextricably linked to the sufferer who first comes to life in On the Heights of Despair I hate wise men because they are lazy cowardly and prudent    So much more complex is the man who suffers from limitless anxiety The wise mans life is empty and sterile for it is free from contradiction and despair An existence full of irreconcilable contradictions is so much richer and creative On the Heights of Despair is a Romantic crisis poem in prose whose main topic is the self at grips with itself God and the universe The selfs personal obsessions predilections and manias become clear from a glance at some of the chapter titles The Passion for the Absurd The Blessings of Insomnia Weariness and Agony The Premonition of Madness On Death On Sadness Nothing Is Important Total Dissatisfaction The Monopoly of Suffering Not to Be a Man Anymore Man the Insomniac Animal Degradation through Work The Flight from the Cross Absolute Lyricism Nonsense Though not poetry On the Heights of Despair is a very lyrical work a song of myself in which the confessional mood becomes a philosophical meditation and where the great philosophical topics like death God infinity time eternity history truth good and evil are no longer abstract but acquire an organic reality a living meaning There are experiences and obsessions with which one cannot live Isnt it then salvation to confess them   To be lyrical means you cannot stay closed up inside yourself The need to externalize is the more intense the more the lyricism is interiorized profound and concentrated    The deepest subjective experiences are also the most universal because through them one reaches the original source of life The origin of this song part cry from the heart part reflective meditation lies in suffering from a real organic affliction insomnia and from the crisis of despair that it induced When Cioran writes that the lyricism of suffering is a song of the blood the flesh and the nerves he gives us a basic definition of his writing in this book as well as in subsequent works despite their more subdued lyrical effusions a writing in which tears turn into thoughts Writing and philosophizing are for Cioran organically related to suffering A running theme throughout On the Heights of Despair is that sickness and suffering have lyrical virtues which alone lead to metaphysical revelations To suffer is to generate knowledge he will write later in Le mauvais demiurge His life and his work are the metamorphosis of tears They ask you for facts proofs works and all you can show them are transformed tears Le mauvais demiurge   The lyrical state being beyond forms and systems Ciorans writing is grotesque formless The chapters of his book are like a chart of his lyrical fevers monitoring the rise and fall of his intense inner life faithfully tracing the course of his dispersion of subjectivity They are unequal both in length and in tone Long meditations on philosophical themes are interspersed with brief lyrical outbursts repetitive to the point of being obsessive often comical and humorous even though the prevalent mood is one of despair At other times especially in the second half of the book they tend increasingly toward aphorism and paradox the trademark of his later writing The style of the book by turns lyrical and ironical poetical and paradoxical rejects the technique of dry philosophical argument in favor of suggestive and vivid imagery and reveals the intellectual and spiritual agony of the philosophers mind in playful yet gripping ways anticipating the later Ciorans unique combination of elegant style and profoundly felt thought This kind of grotesque writing selfconsciously sets itself against a whole tradition of civilized writing and with its emphasis on death suffering and chaos situates itself outside the domain of the aesthetic Compared to the refined culture of forms and frames which mask everything the lyrical mode is utterly barbarian in its expression Its value resides precisely in its savage quality it is only blood sincerity and fire The young barbarians horror of the refinements of sclerotic cultures is a theme that will reappear in Ciorans portrayal of the French in The Temptation to Exist But another more fundamental aspect of Ciorans philosophy is present here in his profession of faith in the resources of absolute lyricism namely his lucidity as a thinker who discovers and mercilessly exposes the hollowness of all philosophical systems On the Heights of Despair is a drama enacted between the suffering problematic man that is the organic and lyrical thinker who is Ciorans sufferer and his archenemy the philosopher or the sage the abstract man a distinction reminiscent of Nietzsches Dionysian and Socratic man Thus Cioran writes that Out of the shadow of the abstract man who thinks for the pleasure of thinking emerges the organic man who thinks because of a vital imbalance and who is beyond science and art The organic or lyrical thinker is the man who turns his tears into thoughts and whose thoughts are obsessions Here is his confession I like thought which preserves a whiff of flesh and blood and I prefer a thousand times an idea rising from sexual tension or nervous depression to an empty abstraction In the clutches of utter despair that state of heightened lucidity which is the negative equivalent of ecstasy the lyrical thinker contemptuously rejects the intellectual optimism of the abstract man Despair is the state in which anxiety and restlessness are immanent to existence Nobody in despair suffers from problems but from his own inner torment and fire Its a pity that nothing can be solved in this world Yet there never was and there never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason So much for the power that intellectual anxiety has over the total anxiety of our being That is why I prefer the dramatic life consumed by inner fires and tortured by destiny to the intellectual caught up in abstractions which do not engage the essence of our subjectivity I despise the absence of risks madness and passion in abstract thinking How fertile live passionate thinking is Lyricism feeds it like blood pumped into the heart Nietzsche in The Birth of Tragedy criticizes the optimism or Greek cheerfulness that goes with the Platonic ideal of the dying Socrates as the human being whom knowledge and reason have liberated from the fear of death Those who pursue this ideal ultimately discover that logic coils up at the boundaries of science and finally bites its own tail whereupon a new form of insight breaks through tragic insight Similarly Cioran attacks those who try to eliminate the fear of death through artificial reasoning    because it is absolutely impossible to cancel an organic fear by way of abstract constructs For Cioran not only is the philosophers attempt to found a system an impossible endeavor it is also a sterile one since the source of genuine human creativity lies precisely in suffering blood tears and the agony of death All important things bear the sign of death Havent people learned yet that the time of superficial intellectual games is over that agony is infinitely more important than syllogism that a cry of despair is more revealing than the most subtle thought and that tears always have deeper roots than smiles In this spirit an attitude which characterizes his later works as well Valery face a ses idoles  Cioran rejects philosophical systems which only manage to reduce the profound to the expressible Those who write under the spell of inspiration for whom thought is an expression of their organic nervous disposition do not concern themselves with unity and systems Such concerns contradictions and facile paradoxes indicate an impoverished and insipid personal life Only great and dangerous contradictions betoken a rich spiritual life because only they constitute a mode of realization for lifes abundant inner flow Savater calls Ciorans philosophical discourse antipedagogical It tackles major philosophical themes but deliberately resists taking shape as an informative and constructive discourse It does not aspire to produce anything new on the subject thus renouncing all false pretensions to originality It never recommends anything except the horrible and the impossible and even that only ironically Cioran never tires of saying that he believes in nothing His destructive discourse going against the grain of traditional philosophical practice unremittingly seeks to expose the contradictions inherent in any philosophical system and cultivates with relish all contraries conferring upon them equal value and equally little significance Everything is possible and yet nothing is All is permitted and yet again nothing No matter which way we go it is no better than any other    There is an explanation for everything and yet there is none Everything is both real and unreal normal and absurd splendid and insipid There is nothing worth more than something else nor any idea better than another    All gain is a loss and all loss is a gain Why always expect a definite stance clear ideas meaningful words I feel as if I should spout fire in response to all the questions which were ever put or not put to me In Syllogismes de Iamertume Cioran recalls in a short anecdote how as a young and ambitious philosophy student he wanted to write a thesis on an extremely original topic and chose to his professors dismay a general theory of tears It may be that On the Heights of Despair was written in lieu of this proposed theory of tears It received the prize of the King Carol I Foundation for Literature and Art My young Cioran is a philosopher who could not or would not philosophize abstractly and systematically and who in a dramatic turnabout of which On the Heights of Despair is the painstaking record became a poet As a poet he continued to philosophize poetically NOTE ON THE TEXT This translation aims at capturing the lyrical whimsical spirit of Ciorans original Romanian not a literal wordforword accuracy Principally this has meant a trimming of Ciorans youthful prose mainly those passages that sound florid or redundant in English All such cuts changes and revisions were either made by or approved by the author who has also cut additional passages and sections that were conceptually repetitive WORKS CITED Calinescu Matei Reflections on Mihail Sebastians For Two Thousand Years  Reading Fiction

Taurus   El Ultimo Dandi El Pais October   Ilinca ZarifopolJohnston On Being Lyrical Why cant we stay closed up inside ourselves Why do we chase after expression and form trying to deliver ourselves of our precious contents or meanings desperately attempting to organize what is after all a rebellious and chaotic process Wouldnt it be more creative simply to surrender to our inner fluidity without any intention of objectifying it intimately and voluptuously soaking in our own inner turmoil and struggle Then we would feel with much richer intensity the whole inner growth of spiritual experience All kinds of insights would blend and flourish in a fertile effervescence A sensation of actuality and spiritual content would be born like the rise of a wave or a musical phrase To be full of ones self not in the sense of pride but of enrichment to be tormented by a sense of inner infinity means to live so intensely that you feel you are about to die of life Such a feeling is so rare and strange that we would live it out with shouts I feel I could die of life and I ask myself if it makes any sense to look for an explanation When your entire spiritual past vibrates inside you with a supreme tension when a sense of total presence resurrects buried experiences and you lose your normal rhythm then from the heights of life you are caught by death without the fear which normally accompanies it It is a feeling similar to that experienced by lovers on the heights of happiness when they have a passing but intense intimation of death or when a Premonition of betrayal haunts their budding love Only a few can endure such experiences to the end There is always a serious danger in repressing something which requires objectification in locking up explosive energy because there comes a moment when one cannot restrain such overwhelming power And then the fall is from too much plenitude There are experiences and obsessions one cannot live with Salvation lies in confessing them The terrifying experience of death when preserved in consciousness becomes ruinous If you talk about death you save part of your self But at the same time something of your real self dies because objectified meanings lose the actuality they have in consciousness This is why lyricism represents a dispersion of subjectivity it is a certain quantity of an individuals spiritual effervescence which cannot be contained and needs constant expression To be lyrical means you cannot stay closed up inside yourself The need to externalize is the more intense the more the lyricism is interiorized profound and concentrated Why is the suffering or loving man lyrical Because such states although different in nature and orientation spring up from the deepest and most intimate part of our being from the substantial center of subjectivity as from a radiation zone One becomes lyrical when ones life beats to an essential rhythm and the experience is so intense that it synthesizes the entire meaning of ones personality What is unique and specific in us is then realized in a form so expressive that the individual rises onto a universal plane The deepest subjective experiences are also the most universal because through them one reaches the original source of life True interiorization leads to a universality inaccessible to those who remain on the periphery The vulgar interpretation of universality calls it a phenomenon of quantitative expansion rather than a qualitatively rich containment Such an interpretation sees lyricism as a peripheral and inferior phenomenon the product of spiritual inconsistency failing to notice that the lyrical resources of subjectivity show remarkable freshness and depth There are people who become lyrical only at crucial moments in their life some only in the throes of death when their entire past suddenly appears before them and hits them with the force of a waterfall Many become lyrical after some decisively critical experience when the turmoil of their inner being reaches paroxysm Thus people who are normally inclined toward objectivity and impersonality strangers both to themselves and to reality once they become prisoners of love experience feelings which actualize all their personal resources The fact that almost everybody writes poetry when in love proves that the resources of conceptual thinking are too poor to express their inner infinity inner lyricism finds adequate objectification only through fluid irrational material The experience of suffering is a similar case You never suspected what lay hidden in yourself and in the world you were living contentedly at the periphery of things when suddenly those feelings of suffering which are second only to death itself take hold of you and transport you into a region of infinite complexity where your subjectivity tosses about in a maelstrom To be lyrical from suffering means to achieve that inner purification in which wounds cease to be mere outer manifestations without deep complications and begin to participate in the essence of your being The lyricism of suffering is a song of the blood the flesh and the nerves True suffering begins in illness Almost all illnesses have lyrical virtues Only those who vegetate in a scandalous insensitivity remain impersonal when ill and thus miss that deepening of the personality brought about by illness One does not become lyrical except after a total organic affliction Accidental lyricism has its source in external factors once they have disappeared their inner correspondent also disappears There is no authentic lyricism without a grain of interior madness It is significant that the beginnings of all mental psychoses are marked by a lyrical phase during which all the usual barriers and limits disappear giving way to an inner drunkenness of the most fertile creative kind This explains the poetic productivity characteristic of the first phases of psychoses Consequently madness could be seen as a sort of paroxysm of lyricism For this reason we should rather write in praise of lyricism than in praise of folly The lyrical state is a state beyond forms and systems A sudden fluidity melts all the elements of our inner life in one fell swoop and creates a full and intense rhythm an ideal convergence Compared to the refined culture of sclerotic forms and frames which mask everything the lyrical mode is utterly barbarian in its expression Its value resides precisely in its savage quality it is only blood sincerity and fire How Distant Everything Is I dont understand why we must do things in this world why we must have friends and aspirations hopes and dreams Wouldnt it be better to retreat to a faraway corner of the world where all its noise and complications would be heard no more Then we could renounce culture and ambitions we would lose everything and gain nothing for what is there to be gained from this world There are people to whom gain is unimportant who are hopelessly unhappy and lonely We are so closed to one another And yet were we to be totally open to each other reading into the depths of our souls how much of our destiny would we see We are so lonely in life that we must ask ourselves if the loneliness of dying is not a symbol of our human existence Can there be any consolation at the last moment This willingness to live and die in society is a mark of great deficiency It is a thousand times preferable to die somewhere alone and abandoned so that you can die without melodramatic posturing unseen by anyone I despise people who on their deathbed master themselves and adopt a pose in order to impress Tears do not burn except in solitude Those who ask to be surrounded by friends when they die do so out of fear and inability to live their final moments alone They want to forget death at the moment of death They lack infinite heroism Why dont they lock their door and suffer those maddening sensations with a lucidity and a fear beyond all limits We are so isolated form everything But isnt everything equally inaccessible to us The deepest and most organic death is death in solitude when even light becomes a principle of death In such moments you will be severed from life from love smiles friends and even from death And you will ask yourself if there is anything besides the nothingness of the world and your own nothingness On Not Wanting to Live There are experiences which one cannot survive after which one feels that there is no meaning left in anything Once you have reached the limits of life having lived to extremity all that is offered at those dangerous borders the everyday gesture and the usual aspiration lose their seductive charm If you go on living you do so only through your capacity for objectification your ability to free yourself in writing from the infinite strain Creativity is a temporary salvation from the claws of death I feel I must burst because of all that life offers me and because of the prospect of death I feel that I am dying of solitude of love of despair of hatred of all that this world offers me With every experience I expand like a balloon blown up beyond its capacity The most terrifying intensification bursts into nothingness You grow inside you dilate madly until there are no boundaries left you reach the edge of light where light is stolen by night and from that plenitude as in a savage whirlwind you are thrown straight into nothingness Life breeds both plenitude and void exuberance and depression What are we when confronted with the interior vortex which swallows us into absurdity I feel my life cracking within me from too much intensity too much disequilibrium It is like an explosion which cannot be contained which throws you up in the air along with everything else At the edge of life you feel that you are no longer master of the life within you that subjectivity is an illusion and that uncontrollable forces are seething inside you evolving with no relation to a personal center or a definite individual rhythm At the edge of life everything is an occasion for death You die because of all there is and all there is not Every experience is in this case a leap into nothingness When you have lived everything life has offered you to a paroxysm of supreme intensity you have reached the stage at which you can no longer experience anything because there is nothing left Even if you have not exhausted all the possibilities of these experiences it is enough to have lived the principal ones to their limit And when you feel that you are dying of loneliness despair or love all that you have not experienced joins in this endlessly sorrowful procession The feeling that you cannot survive such whirlwinds also arises from a consummation on a purely inner plane The flames of life burn in a closed oven from which the heat cannot escape Those who live on an external plane are saved from the outset but do they have anything to save when they are not aware of any danger The paroxysm of interior experience leads you to regions where danger is absolute because life which selfconsciously actualizes its roots in experience can only negate itself Life is too limited and too fragmentary to endure great tensions Did not all the mystics feel that they could not live after their great ecstasies What could they expect from this world those who sense beyond the normal limits life loneliness despair and death The Passion for the Absurd There are no arguments Can anyone who has reached the limit bother with arguments causes effects moral considerations and so forth Of course not For such a person there are only unmotivated motives for living On the heights of despair the passion for the absurd is the only thing that can still throw a demonic light on chaos When all the current reasons moral esthetic religious social and so on no longer guide ones life how can one sustain life without succumbing to nothingness Only by a connection with the absurd by love of absolute uselessness loving something which does not have substance but which simulates an illusion of life I live because the mountains do not laugh and the worms do not sing The passion for the absurd can grow only in a man who has exhausted everything yet is still capable of undergoing awesome transfigurations For one who has lost everything there is nothing left in life except the passion of the absurd What else in life could still move such a person What seductions Some say selfsacrifice for humanity the public good the cult of the beautiful and so forth I like only those people who have done away with all that even for a short time Only they have lived in an absolute manner Only they have the right to speak about life You can recover love or serenity But you recover it through heroism not ignorance An existence which does not hide a great madness has no value How is it different from the existence of a stone a piece of wood or something rotten And yet I tell you you must hide a great madness in order to want to become stone wood or rot Only when you have tasted all the poisoning sweetness of the absurd are you fully purified because only then will you have pushed negation to its final expression And are not all final expressions absurd THERE ARE PEOPLE who are destined to taste only the poison in things for whom any surprise is a painful surprise and any experience a new occasion for torture If someone were to say to me that such suffering has subjective reasons related to the individuals particular makeup I would then ask Is there an objective criterion for evaluating suffering Who can say with precision that my neighbor suffers more than I do or that Jesus suffered more than all of us There is no objective standard because suffering cannot be measured according to the external stimulation or local irritation of the organism but only as it is felt and reflected in consciousness Alas from this point of view any hierarchy is out of the question Each person remains with his own suffering which he believes absolute and unlimited How much would we diminish our own personal suffering if we were to compare it to all the worlds sufferings until now to the most horrifying agonies and the most complicated tortures the most cruel deaths and the most painful betrayals all the lepers all those burned alive or starved to death Nobody is comforted in his sufferings by the thought that we are all mortals nor does anybody who suffers really find comfort in the past or present suffering of others Because in this organically insufficient and fragmentary world the individual is set to live fully wishing to make of his own existence an absolute Each subjective existence is absolute to itself For this reason each man lives as if he were the center of the universe or the center of history Then how could his suffering fail to be absolute I cannot understand anothers suffering in order to diminish my own Comparisons in such cases are irrelevant because suffering is an interior state in which nothing external can help But there is a great advantage in the loneliness of suffering What would happen if a mans face could adequately express his suffering if his entire inner agony were objectified in his facial expression Could we still communicate Wouldnt we then cover our faces with our hands while talking Life would really be impossible if the infinitude of feelings we harbor within ourselves were fully expressed in the lines of our faces Nobody would dare look at himself in the mirror because a grotesque tragic image would mix in the contours of his face with stains and traces of blood wounds which cannot be healed and unstoppable streams of tears I would experience a kind of voluptuous awe if I could see a volcano of blood eruptions as red as fire and as burning as despair burst into the midst of the comfortable and superficial harmony of everyday life or if I could see all our hidden wounds open making of us a bloody eruption forever Only then would we truly understand and appreciate the advantage of loneliness which silences our suffering and makes it inaccessible The venom drawn out from suffering would be enough to poison the whole world in a bloody eruption bursting out of the volcano of our being There is so much venom so much poison in suffering TRUE SOLITUDE is the feeling of being absolutely isolated between the earth and the sky Nothing should detract attention from these phenomena of absolute isolation a fearfully lucid intuition will reveal the entire drama of mans finite nature facing the infinite nothingness of the world Solitary walks extremely fertile and dangerous at the same time for the inner life must take place in such a way that nothing will obscure the solitarys meditation on mans isolation in the world Solitary walks are propitious to an intense process of interiorization especially in the evening when none of the usual seductions can steal ones interest Then revelations about the world spring from the deepest corner of the spirit from the place where it has detached itself from life from the wound of life To achieve spirituality one must be very lonely So much deathinlife and so many inner conflagrations Loneliness negates so much of life that the spirits blooming in vital dislocations becomes almost insufferable Isnt it significant that those who have too much spirit who know the deep wound inflicted on life at the birth of the spirit are the ones who rise against it Healthy fat people without the least intuition of what spirit is who have never suffered the tortures of life and the painful antinomies at the base of existence are the ones who rise up in defense of the spirit Those who truly know it either tolerate it with pride or regard it as a calamity Nobody can really be pleased at the bottom of his heart with spirit an acquisition so damaging to life How can one be pleased with life without its charm naivete and spontaneity The presence of the spirit indicates a want of life great loneliness and long suffering Who dares talk of salvation through the spirit It is by no means true that life on the immanent plane creates an anxiety from which man escapes through the spirit On the contrary it is much more true that through spirit man achieves disequilibrium anxiety as well as grandeur What do you expect those who dont know the dangers of life to know of the dangers of the spirit To argue the case for spirit is a sign of great ignorance just as to make a case for life is a sign of great disequilibrium For the normal man life is an undisputed reality only the sick man is delighted by life and praises it so that he wont collapse And what about the man who cannot praise either life or the spirit The World and I I am therefore the world is meaningless What meaning is there in the tragic suffering of a man for whom everything is ultimately nothing and whose only law in this world is agony If the world tolerates somebody like me this can only mean that the blots on I the socalled sun of life are so large that in time they will obscure its light Lifes beastliness trampled me under foot and oppressed me clipped my wings in full flight and stole all my rightful joys  The enthusiastic zeal and mad passion I put into becoming a brilliant individual the demonic charm I adopted to gain an aura in the future and the energy I spent on an organic glamorous inner rebirth all proved weaker than the beastly brutality and irrationality of this world which poured into me all its reserves of negativity and poison Life is impossible at high temperatures Thats why I have reached the conclusion that anguished people whose inner dynamism is so intense that it reaches paroxysm and who cannot accept normal temperatures are doomed to  fall The destruction of those who live unusual lives is an aspect of lifes demonism but it is also an aspect of its insufficiency which explains why life is the privilege of mediocre people Only mediocrities live at lifes normal temperature the others are consumed at temperatures at which life cannot endure at which they can barely breathe already one foot beyond life I cannot contribute anything to this world because I only have one method agony You complain that people are mean vengeful ungrateful and hypocritical I propose the agony method to rid you of all these imperfections Apply it to every generation and its effects will soon be evident Maybe in this way I too could become useful to mankind Bring every man to the agony of lifes last moments by whip fire or injections and through terrible torture he will undergo the great purification afforded by a vision of death Then free him and let him run in a fright until he falls exhausted I warrant you that the effect is incomparably greater than any obtained through normal means If I could I would drive the entire world to agony to achieve a radical purification of life I would set a fire burning insidiously at the roots of life not to destroy them but to give them a new and different sap a new heat The fire I would set to the world would not bring ruin but cosmic transfiguration In this way life would adjust to higher temperatures and would cease to be an environment propitious to mediocrity And maybe in this dream death too would cease to be immanent in life These lines written today April   when I turn twenty two It is strange to think that I am already a specialist in the question of death Weariness and Agony Are you familiar with the frightening sensation of melting the feeling of dissolving into a flowing river in which the self is annulled by organic liquidization Everything solid and substantial in you melts away in a wearisome fluidity and the only thing left is your head Im speaking of a precise painful sensation not a vague and undetermined one As in a hallucinatory dream you feel that only your head is left without foundation and support without a body This feeling has nothing to do with that vague and voluptuous weariness by the seaside or in melancholy dreamy musings it is a weariness which consumes and destroys No effort no hope no illusion can satisfy you any longer Shocked witless by your own catastrophe unable to think or to act caught in cold and heavy darkness solitary as in moments of profound regret you have reached the negative limit of life its absolute temperature where the last illusions about life freeze The true meaning of agony which is not a struggle of pure passion or gratuitous fantasy but lifes hopeless struggle in the claws of death is revealed in this feeling of great weariness One cannot separate the thought of agony from that of weariness and death Agony as struggle But with whom and for what The interpretation of agony as an ardor exalted by its own futility or as a battle whose aim is itself is absolutely false In fact agony means a battle between life and death Since death is immanent in life almost all of life is an agony I call agonic only those dramatic moments in the battle between life and death when the presence of death is experienced consciously and painfully True agony occurs when you pass into nothingness through death when a feeling of weariness consumes you irrevocably and death wins In every true agony there is a triumph of death even though you may continue to live after those moments of weariness There is nothing imaginary in this turmoil Every agony bears a conclusive stamp Isnt agony similar to an incurable sickness which torments us intermittently Agonic moments chart the progress of death in life revealing a drama in our consciousness caused by the disruption of the balance between life and death Such moments are not possible except in that sensation of weariness which brings life down to its absolute negative value Frequency of agonic moments is an indicator of decomposition and ruin Death is something disgusting the only obsession which cannot become voluptuous Even when you want to die you do it with an implicit regret for your own desire want to die but I am sorry that I want to die This is the feeling experienced by those who abandon themselves to nothingness The most perverse feeling is the feeling of death Imagine that there are people who cannot sleep because of their perverse obsession with death How I wish I did not know anything about myself and this world Despair and the Grotesque Among the many forms of the grotesque I find the one whose roots are steeped in despair more unusual and complex The other forms have less intensity It is important to note that the grotesque is inconceivable without intensity of feeling And what intensity is deeper and more organic than despair The grotesque appears only in very negative states when great anxiety arises from a lack of life the grotesque is an exaltation in negativity There is a mad launch toward negativity in that bestial agonizing grimace when the shape and lines of the face are contorted into strangely expressive forms when the look in ones eyes changes with distant light and shadow and ones thoughts follow the curve of similar distortions Truly intense and irrevocable despair cannot be objectified except in grotesque expressions because the grotesque is the absolute negation of serenity that state of purity transparence and lucidity so different from the chaos and nothingness of despair Have you ever had the brutal and amazing satisfaction of looking at yourself in the mirror after countless sleepless nights Have you suffered the torment of insomnia when you count the minutes for nights on end when you feel alone in this world when your drama seems to be the most important in history and history ceases to have meaning ceases to exist When the most terrifying flames grow in you and your existence appears unique and isolated in a world made only for the consummation of your agony You must have felt those moments as countless and infinite as suffering in order to have a clear picture of the grotesque when you look at yourself in the mirror It is a picture of total strain a tense grimace to which is added the demonically seductive pallor of a man who has struggled along horrible dark precipices Isnt this grotesque expression of despair similar to a precipice It has something of the abysmal maelstrom of great depths the seduction of the all encompassing infinite to which we bow as we bow to fatality How good it would be if one could die by throwing oneself into an infinite void The complexity of the grotesque born out of despair resides in its capacity to indicate an inner infinity and to produce a paroxysm of the highest tension How could this intense agony manifest itself in pleasant linear curves and formal purity The grotesque essentially negates the classic as well as any idea of style harmony and perfection It is evident to anyone who understands the multiple forms of inner drama that the grotesque hides secret tragedies indirectly expressed Whoever has seen his face grotesquely disfigured can never forget it because he will always be afraid of himself Despair is followed by painful anxiety What else does the grotesque do if it does not actualize fear and anxiety The Premonition of Madness We generally find it hard to understand that some of us must go mad But sliding into chaos where moments of lucidity are like short flashes of lightning is an inexorable fatality Inspired pages of absolute lyricism in which you are the prisoner of a total drunkenness of being can only be written in a state of such exalted nervous tension that any return to equilibrium is an illusion One cannot live normally after such efforts The intimate springs of being can no longer sustain normal evolution and inner barriers lose all reality The premonition of madness appears only after such capital experiences One loses ones sense of security and the normal sensation of the immediate and the concrete as if one were soaring to heights and suffering from vertigo A heavy load weighs on the brain compressing it to an illusion although the frightening organic reality from which our experiences spring can only be revealed through such sensations An indefinable terror arises from this oppression throwing you to the ground or blowing you up in the air It is not just the suffocating fear of death that obsesses man it is another terror occurring rarely but intensely like flashes of lightning like a sudden disturbance which forever eliminates the hope of future serenity It is impossible to pinpoint and define this strange premonition of madness The truly awful thing in madness is that we sense a total and irrevocable loss of life while we are still living I continue to eat and drink but I have lost whatever consciousness I bring to my biological functions It is only an approximate death In madness one loses the specific individual traits which single one out in the universe the personal perspective and a certain orientation of consciousness In death one loses everything by a fall into nothingness That is why the fear of death is per istent and essential but actually less strange than the fear of madness in which our semipresence creates an anxiety more complex than the organic fear of the total nothingness of death but wouldnt madness be an escape from the misery of life This question has only a theoretical justification since practically speaking for the anguished man the problem appears in a different light or rather in a different shadow The premonition of madness is complicated by the fear of lucidity in madness the fear of the moments of return and reunion when the intuition of disaster is so painful that it almost provokes a greater madness There is no salvation through madness because no man with a premonition of madness can overcome his fear of possible moments of lucidity One would welcome chaos if one were not afraid of lights in it The specific form of ones madness is determined by organic and temperamental conditions Since the majority of madmen are depressive depressive madness is inevitably more common than pleasant gay manic exaltation Black melancholy is so frequent among madmen that almost all of them have suicidal tendencies whereas for sane people suicide appears a very problematic solution I would like to go mad on one condition namely that I would become a happy madman lively and always in a good mood without any troubles and obsessions laughing senselessly from morning to night Although I long for luminous ecstasies I wouldnt ask for any because I know they are followed by great depressions I would like instead a shower of warm light to fall from me transfiguring the entire world an unecstatic burst of light preserving the calm of luminous eternity Far from the concentrations of ecstasy it would be all graceful lightness and smiling warmth The entire world should float in this dream of light in this transparent and unreal state of delight Obstacles and matter form and limits would cease to exist Then let me die of light in such a landscape On Death There are questions which once approached either isolate you or kill you outright Afterward you have nothing more to lose From then on your erstwhile serious pursuits your spiritual quest for more varied forms of life your limitless longing for inaccessible things your elevated frustration with the limits of empiricism all become simple manifestations of an excessively exuberant sensibility lacking the profound seriousness which characterizes the man who has penetrated the realm of dangerous mysteries Im not talking here of the spiritual calm and empty solemnity of socalled serious people but of a mad tension that puts every moment of your life on the plane of eternity This profound seriousness cannot be achieved by confronting purely formal problems no matter how difficult because they are generated exclusively by our intelligence not by the total organic structure of our being Only the organic and existential thinker is capable of this kind of seriousness because truth for him is alive born from inner agony and organic disorder rather than useless speculation Out of the shadow of the abstract man who thinks for the pleasure of thinking emerges the organic man who thinks because of a vital imbalance and who is beyond science and art I like thought which preserves a whiff of flesh and blood and I prefer a thousand times an idea rising from sexual tension or nervous depression to an empty abstraction Havent people learned yet that the time of superficial intellectual games is over that agony is infinitely more important than syllogism that a cry of despair is more revealing than the most subtle thought and that tears always have deeper roots than smiles Why dont we want to acknowledge the exclusive value of live truths of truths born in us and revealing a reality proper only to us Why dont we want to accept that one can entertain lively meditations on death the most dangerous issue existing Death is not something from outside ontologically different from life because there is no death independent of life To step into death does not mean as commonly believed especially by Christians to draw ones last breath and to pass into a region qualitatively different from life It means rather to discover in the course of life the way toward death and to find in lifes vital signs the immanent abyss of death For Christianity and other metaphysical beliefs in immortality the passing into death is a triumph an opening toward other regions metaphysically different from life Contrary to such visions the true sense of agony seems to me to lie in the revelation of deaths immanence in life But why is the experience of agony so rare Can it be that our hypothesis is entirely false and that sketching a metaphysics of death is possible only by accepting deaths transcendental nature Healthy normal mediocre people cannot experience either agony or death They live as if life had a definitive character It is an integral part of normal peoples superficial equilibrium to take life as absolutely independent from death and to objectify death as a reality transcending life Thats why they perceive death as coming from the outside not as an inner fatality of life itself One of the greatest delusions of the average man is to forget that life is deaths prisoner Metaphysical revelations begin only when ones superficial equilibrium starts to totter and a painful struggle is substituted for naive spontaneity The premontion of death is so rare in average people that one can practically say that it does not exist The fact that the presentiment of death appears only when life is shaken to its foundations proves beyond doubt the immanence of death in life An insight into these depths shows us how illusory is the belief in lifes integrity and how well founded the belief in a metaphysical substratum of demonism If death is immanent in life why does awareness of death make living impossible The average man is not troubled by this awareness because the process of passing into death happens simply through a diminution of vital intensity For such a man there is only the agony of the last hour not the longlasting agony related to the very premise of life From a grave perspective every step in life is a step into death and memory is only the sign of nothingness The average man deprived of metaphysical understanding does not have this consciousness of progressive advance into death though neither he nor anyone else can escape its inexorable destiny But when consciousness becomes independent of life the revelation of death becomes so strong that its presence destroys all naivete all joyful enthusiasm and all natural voluptuousness To have the consciousness of death is something perverse and extremely corrupt The naive poetry of life its seductions and charms appear empty of content Equally empty are mans finalizing projects and his theological illusions To see how death spreads over this world how it kills a tree and how it penetrates dreams how it withers a flower or a civilization how it gnaws on the individual and on culture like a destructive blight means to be beyond tears and regrets beyond system and form Whoever has not experienced the awful agony of death rising and spreading like a surge of blood like the choking grasp of a snake which provokes terrifying hallucinations does not know the demonic character of life and the state of inner effervescence from which great transfigurations arise Such a state of black drunkenness is a necessary prerequisite to understanding why one wishes the immediate end of this world Its not the luminous drunkenness of ecstasy in which paradisal visions conquer you with their splendor and you rise to a purity that sublimates into immateriality but a mad dangerous ruinous and tormented black drunkenness in which death appears with the awful seduction of nightmarish snake eyes To experience such sensations and images means to be so close to the essence of reality that both life and death shed their illusions and attain within you their most dramatic form An exalted agony combines life and death in a horrible maelstrom a beastly satanism borrows tears from voluptuousness Life as a long agony on the road to death is nothing but another manifestation of lifes demoniacal dialectics in which forms are given birth only to be destroyed The irrationality of life manifests itself in this overhelming expansion of form and content in this frenetic impulse to substitute new aspects for old ones a substitution however without qualitative improvement Happy the man who could abandon himself to this becoming and could absorb all the possibilities offered each moment ignoring the agonizingly problematic evaluation which discovers in every moment an insurmountable relativity Naivete is the only road to salvation But for those who feel and conceive life as a long agony the question of salvation is a simple one There is no salvation on their road The revelation of deaths immanence in life occurs during illnesses and long depressive states There are of course other ways but they are accidental and individual and do not have the same potential for revelation as illness or depression If illnesses have a philosophical mission in the world then it can only be to prove how illusory is the feeling of lifes eternity and how fragile its illusion of finality In illness death is always already in life Genuine ailment links us to metaphysical realities which the healthy average man cannot understand Young people talk of death as external to life But when an illness hits them with full power all the illusions and seductions of youth disappear In this world the only genuine agonies are those sprung from illness All others bear the fatal mark of bookishness Only those who truly suffer are capable of genuine content and infinite seriousness The others are born to harmony love dance and gracefulness And there are many who would gladly give up metaphysical revelations obtained through despair agony and death in exchange for a naive love or the voluptuous unconsciousness of dance And there are many who would renounce glory acquired through suffering for an anonymous happy existence All illnesses are heroic but with a heroism of resistance not of conquest The heroism of illness defends lifes lost redoubts The losses are irrevocable not only for sick people but also for those who suffer frequently from depressive fits This explains why current psychological interpretations find no adequate justification for the fear of death common in some types of depression The structure of depressive states holds the key to their fundamental understanding These states in which separation from the world steadily and painfully increases bring man closer to his inner reality and cause him to discover death in his own subjectivity A growing interiority progresses toward the essential center of subjectivity overcoming all the social forms which usually mask it Once beyond this center progressive interiority discovers the region where life mingles with death where man has not yet detached himself from the primary sources of existence where the demonic rhythm of life works with complete irrationality In cases of depression the awareness of deaths immanence in life creates an atmosphere of constant dissatisfaction and restlessness that can never be appeased The presence of death in life introduces into ones existence an element of nothingness One cannot conceive of death without nothingness nor of life without a principle of negativity The fear of death which is nothing but the fear of the nothingness into which death throws us proves that death presupposes nothingness The immanence of death in life is a sign of the final triumph of nothingness over life thus showing that the presence of death has no other meaning than to open progressively the way toward nothingness Even though belief in eternity is necessary as historical mans unique consolation the catastrophic ending of this tragedy of life and of man in particular will demonstrate the illusion of such naive faith The only fear is in fact the fear of death Different kinds of fears are merely a manifestation of the same fundamental psychological reality in its various aspects Those who try to eliminate the fear of death through artificial reasoning are totally mistaken because it is impossible to cancel an organic fear by way of abstract constructs Whoever seriously considers the question of death must be afraid Even those who believe in eternity do so because they are afraid of death There is in their faith a painful effort to save even without an absolute certitude the world of values in which they live and to which they contribute an effort to defeat the nothingness inherent in the temporal and attain the universal in eternity Death met without religious faith leaves nothing standing Universal category and form berne illusory and irrelevant when confronted with the irreversible annihilation of death Never will form and category grasp the intimate meanings of life and death Could idealism or rationalism counteract death Not at all Yet other philosophies and doctrines say almost nothing about death The only valid attitude is absolute silence or a cry of despair Some people maintain that the fear of death does not have a deeper justification because as long as there is an I there is no death and once dead there is no any longer These people have forgotten about the very strange phenomenon of gradual agony What comfort does this artificial distinction between the and death offer a man who has a strong premonition of death What meaning can logical argument or subtle thought have for someone deeply imbued with a feeling of the irrevocable All attempts to bring existential questions onto a logical plane are null and void Philosophers are too proud to confess their fear of death and too supercilious to acknowledge the spiritual fecundity of illness Their reflections on death exhibit a hypocritical serenity in fact they tremble with fear more than anyone else One should not forget that philosophy is the art of masking inner torments The feeling for the irreversible and the irrevocable which always accompanies the awareness of agony can achieve a painful acceptance mixed with fear but there is no such thing as love or sympathy for death The art of dying cannot be learned because there is no technique there are no rules The irrevocability of agony is experienced by each individual alone through infinite and intense suffering Most people are unaware of the slow agony within themselves For them there is only one kind of agony the one immediately preceding the fall into absolute nothingness Only such moments of agony bring about important existential revelations in consciousness That is why they expect everything from the end instead of trying to grasp the meaning of a slow revelatory agony The end will reveal too little and they will die as ignorant as they have lived Since agony unfolds in time temporality is a condition not only for creativity but also for death for the dramatic phenomenon of dying The demonic character of time in which both life and death creation and destruction evolve without convergence toward a transcendental plane is thus made manifest The feeling of the irrevocable which appears as an ineluctable necessity going against the grain of our innermost tendencies is conceivable only because of times demonism The conviction that you cannot escape an implacable fate and that time will do nothing but unfold the dramatic process of destruction is an expression of irrevocable agony Isnt nothingness then salvation But how can there be salvation in nothingness If salvation is nearly impossible through existence how can it be possible through the complete absence of existence Since there is no salvation either in existence or in nothingness let this world with its eternal laws be smashed to pieces Melancholy Every state of the soul adopts its own external form or transforms the soul according to its nature In all great and profound states there is a close correspondence between the subjective and the objective level Overflowing enthusiasm is inconceivable in a flat and closed space Mens eyes see outwardly that which troubles them internally Ecstasy is never a purely internal consummation it externalizes a luminous inner intoxication It would suffice simply to look at the face of an ecstatic to grasp fully all the elements of his inner tension Why does melancholy require exterior infinity Because it is boundless and void expansion One can cross boundaries either positively or negatively Exuberance enthusiasm fury are positive slates of overflowing intensity which break restrictive barriers and go beyond normal states They spring from an excess of life vitality and organic expansion In such positive states life goes beyond its normal boundaries not to negate itself but to liberate its smoldering energies which would otherwise unleash a violent conflagration Crossing boundaries has a totally different meaning for negative spiritual states since it does not happen from an overflow of plenitude but from quite the contrary A void originates in the depths of being spreading progressively like a cancer The sensation of expansion toward nothingness present in melancholy has its roots in a weariness characteristic of all negative states This weariness separates man from the world Lifes intense rhythm its organic inner pulse weakens Weariness is the first organic determinant of knowledge Because it creates the necessary conditions for mans differentiation from the world weariness leads one to the perspective which places the world in front of man Weariness also takes one below lifes normal level allowing only a vague premonition of vital signs Melancholy therefore springs from a region where life is uncertain and problematic Its origin explains its fertility for knowledge and its sterility for life Whereas in ordinary states of mind one is in close contact with lifes individual aspects in melancholy being separated from them produces a vague feeling of the world Solitary experience and a strange vision melt the substantial forms of the world They take on an immaterial and transparent garb Progressive detachment from all that is particular and concrete raises one to a vision which gains in size what it loses in substance No melancholy state can exist without this ascent this flight toward the heights this elevation above the world Neither pride nor scorn despair nor any impulse toward infinite negativity but long meditation and vague dreaminess born of weariness lead to this kind of elevation Man grows wings in melancholy not in order to enjoy the world but in order to be alone What is the meaning of loneliness in melancholy Isnt it related to the feeling of interior and exterior infinity The melancholy look is expressionless without perspective The interior infinitude and vagueness of melancholy not to be confused with the fecund infinity of love demands a space whose borders are ungraspable Melancholy is without clear or precise intentions whereas ordinary experience requires concrete objects and forms Melancholy detachment removes man from his natural surroundings His outlook on infinity shows him to be lonely and forsaken The sharper our consciousness of the worlds infinity the more acute our awareness of our own finitude In some states this awareness is painfully depressing but in melancholy it is less tormenting and sometimes even rather voluptuous The disparity between the worlds infinity and mans finitude is a serious cause for despair but when one looks at this disparity in states of melancholy it ceases to be painful and the world appears endowed with a strange sickly beauty Real solitude implies a painful intermission in mans life a lonely struggle with the angel of death To live in solitude means to relinquish all expectations about life The only surprise in solitude is death The great solitaries retreated from the world not to prepare themselves for life but rather to await with resignation its end No messages about life ever issue forth from deserts and caves Havent we proscribed all religions that began in the desert All the illuminations and dreams of the great solitaries reveal an apocalyptic vision of downfall and the end rather than a crown of lights and triumphs The solitude of the melancholic man is less profound It even has sometimes an esthetic character Dont we talk of sweet melancholy or of voluptuous melancholy Melancholy is an esthetic mood because of its very passivity The esthetic attitude toward life is characterized by contemplative passivity randomly selecting everything that suits its subjectivity The world is a stage and man the spectator passively watches it The conception of life as spectacle eliminates its tragic element as well as those antinomies which drag you like a whirlwind into the painful drama of the world The esthetic experience where each moment is a matter of impressions can hardly surmise the great tensions inherent in the experience of the tragic where each moment is a matter of destiny Dreaminess central to all esthetic states is absent from tragedy Passivity dreaminess and voluptuous enchantment form the esthetic elements of melancholy Yet due to its multifarious forms it is not purely esthetic Black melancholy is also fairly frequent But first what is sweet melancholy On summer afternoons havent you experienced that sensation of strange pleasure when you abandon yourself to the senses without any special thought and when intimations of serene eternity bring an unusual peace to your soul It is as if all worldly worries and all spiritual doubts grow dumb in front of a display of overwhelming beauty whose seductions render all questions superfluous Beyond turmoil and effervescence a quiet existence enjoys the surrounding splendor with discreet voluptuousness Calm the absence of intensity of any kind is essential to melancholy Regret also inherent in melancholy expands its lack of intensity But though regret may be persistent it is never so intense as to cause deep suffering Regret expresses affectively a profound phenomenon the advance through life into death It shows us how much has died in us regret something which died in me and from me I bring back to life only the ghost of past experiences Regret reveals the demonic significance of time while bringing about growth it implicitly triggers death Regret makes man melancholy without paralyzing or cutting short his aspirations because in regret the awareness of the irredeemable focuses on the past and the future is still left somewhat open Melancholy is not a state of concentrated closed seriousness brought forth by an organic affliction because it lacks the terrible sense of irrevocability so characteristic of states of genuine sadness Even black melancholy is only a temporary mood not a constitutional feature Its dreamy character never completely absent black melancholy can never be a true illness Sweet and voluptuous melancholy as well as black melancholy exhibits similar traits interior void exterior infinity vagueness of sensations dreaminess sublimation Their differentiation is apparent only from the point of view of affective tonalities It may be that the multipolarity of melancholy derives more from the structure of subjectivity than from its own nature Not particularly intense it fluctuates more than other states Endowed with more poetic than active virtues it possesses a certain subdued gracefulness totally absent from tragic and intense sadness The same gracefulness marks melancholy landscapes The wide perspective of Dutch or Renaissance landscape with its eternity of lights and shadows its undulating vales symbolizing infinity its transfiguring rays of light which spiritualize the material world and the hopes and regrets of men who smile wisely the whole perspective breathes an easy melancholy grace In such a landscape man seems to say regretfully and resignedly What can we do Its all we have At the end of all melancholy there is a chance of consolation or resignation Its esthetic aspect holds possibilities for future harmony which are absent from profound organic sadness The latter ends in the irrevocable the former in graceful dream Nothing Is Important How important can it be that I suffer and think My presence in this world will disturb a few tranquil lives and will unsettle the unconscious and pleasant naivete of others Although I feel that my tragedy is the greatest in history greater than the fall of empires I am nevertheless aware of my total insignificance I am absolutely persuaded that I am nothing in this universe yet I feel that mine is the only real existence If I had to choose between the world and me I would reject the world its lights and laws unafraid to glide alone in absolute nothingness Although life for me is torture I cannot renounce it because I do not believe in the absolute values in whose name I would sacrifice myself If I were to be totally sincere I would say that I do not know why I live and why I do not stop living The answer probably lies in the irrational character of life which maintains itself without reason What if there were only absurd motives for living Could they still be called motives This world is not worth a sacrifice in the name of an idea or a belief How much happier are we today because others have died for our wellbeing and our enlightment Wellbeing Enlightment If anybody had died so that I could be happy then I would be even more unhappy because I do not want to build my life on a graveyard There are moments when I feel responsible for all the suffering in history since I cannot understand why some have shed blood for us It would be a great irony if we could determine that they were happier than we are Let history crumble into dust Why should I bother Let death appear in a ridiculous light suffering limited and unrevealing enthusiasm impure life rational lifes dialectics logical rather than demonic despair minor and partial eternity just a word the experience of nothingness an illusion fatality a joke I seriously ask myself What is the meaning of all this Why raise questions throw lights or see shadows Wouldnt it be better if I buried my tears in the sand on a seashore in utter solitude But I never cried because my tears have always turned into thoughts And my thoughts are as bitter as tears Ecstasy I do not know what the skeptic for whom this world is a world in which nothing is solved thinks of ecstasy the richest and most dangerous ecstasy the ecstasy of lifes ultimate origins You do not gain explicit certainty or definite knowledge by it yet the feeling of essential participation is so intense that it surpasses all limits and categories of common knowledge A gate opens from this world of toil pain and suffering to the inner sanctum of life where we apprehend a most simple vision in a glorious metaphysical trance Superficial and individual layers of existence melt away revealing original depths I wonder whether a truly metaphysical feeling is even possible without the disappearance of superficial forms One reaches the center of life only by purifying it of contingent and accidental elements A metaphysical existential feeling is by definition ecstatic and all metaphysical systems have roots in forms of ecstasy There are many other forms of ecstasy which given a certain spiritual or temperamental configuration do not necessarily lead to transcendence Why shouldnt there be an ecstasy of pure existence Metaphysical existentialism is born out of ecstasy in front of the worlds primordial origins it is the ultimate intoxication ecstatic bliss in the contemplation of essence Ecstasy exaltation in immanence illumination a vision of this worlds madness such is the basis of any metaphysics valid even in the final moments of life Any true ecstasy is dangerous It resembles the last stage of initiation in the Egyptian mysteries when instead of the ultimate knowledge one is told Osiris is a black divinity The absolute remains un lovable I see a form of madness not of knowledge in the ecstasy of lifes ultimate origins You cannot experience it except in solitude when you feel as if you were floating above the world Solitude is the proper milieu for madness It is noteworthy that even the skeptic can experience this kind of ecstasy Does not the madness of ecstasy reveal itself through this odd combination of certitude and essence with doubt and despair Nobody will experience ecstasy without having experienced despair beforehand because both states presuppose equally radical purifications though different in kind The roots of metaphysics are as complex as those of existence The World in Which Nothing Is Solved Is there anything on earth which cannot be doubted except death the only certainty in this world To doubt and yet to live this is a paradox though not a tragic one since doubt is less intense less consuming than despair Abstract doubt in which one participates only partially is more frequent whereas in despair one participates totally and organically Not even the most organic and serious forms of doubt ever reach the intensity of despair In comparison with despair skepticism is characterized by a certain amount of dilettantism and superficiality I can doubt everything I may very well smile contemptuously at the world but this will not prevent me from eating from sleeping peacefully and from marrying In despair whose depth one can fathom only by experiencing it such actions are possible only with great effort On the heights of despair nobody has the right to sleep Thus a genuinely desperate man cannot forget his own tragedy his consciousness preserves the painful actuality of his subjective torment Doubt is anxiety about problems and things and has its origins in the unsolvable nature of all big questions If such questions could be solved the skeptic would revert to more normal states The condition of the desperate man in this respect is utterly different if all problems were solved he would not be any less anxious since his anxiety arises out of his own subjective existence Despair is the state in which anxiety and restlessness are immanent to existence Nobody in despair suffers from Problems but from his own inner torment and fire Its a pity that nothing can be solved in this world Yet there never was and here never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason So much for the power that intellectual anxiety has over the total anxiety of our being That is why I prefer the dramatic life consumed by inner fires and tortured by destiny to the intellectual caught up in abstractions which do not engage the essence of our subjectivity I despise the absence of risks madness and passion in abstract thinking How fertile live passionate thinking is Lyricism feeds it like blood pumped into the heart It is interesting to observe the dramatic process by which men originally preoccupied with abstract and impersonal problems so objective as to forget themselves come to reflect upon their own subjectivity and upon existential questions once they experience sickness and suffering Active and objective men do not have enough inner resources to make an interesting problem of their own destiny One must descend all the circles of an inner hell to turn ones destiny into a subjective yet universal problem If you are not burned to ashes you will then be able to philosophize lyrically Only when you do not deign even to despise this world of unsolvable problems will you finally come to achieve a superior form of personal existence And this will be so not because you have any special value or excellence but because nothing interests you beyond your own personal agony The Contradictory and the Inconsequential Those who write under the spell of inspiration for whom thought is an expression of their organic nervous disposition do not concern themselves with unity and systems Such concerns contradictions and facile paradoxes indicate an impoverished and insipid personal life Only great and dangerous contradictions betoken a rich spiritual life because only they constitute a mode of realization for lifes abundant inner flow People who know only a few spiritual states and never live on the edge do not have contradictions because their limited resources cannot form oppositions But how can those who violently experience hatred despair chaos nothingness or love who burn with each passion and gradually die with each and in each those who can only breathe on heights who are always alone especially when they are with others how can they grow in linear fashion and crystallize into a system All that is form system category frame or plan tends to make things absolute and springs from a lack of inner energy from a sterile spiritual life Lifes great tensions verge on chaos and the madness of exaltation Rich spiritual life must know chaos and the effervescent paroxysm of illness because in them inspiration appears to be essential for creation and contradictions become expressions of high inner temperatures Nobody who does not love chaos is a creator and whoever is contemptuous of illness must not speak of the spirit There is value only in that which bursts forth from inspiration which springs up from the irrational depths of our being from the secret center of our subjectivity The fruit of labor effort and endeavor worthwhile noticing how the domain of esthetics narrows gradually as it approaches serious reality and crucial life events Death suffering and sadness negate esthetics Death and beauty are totally opposed notions I know nothing more disgusting than death nothing more serious and more sinister How could some poets find beautiful this ultimate negation which cannot even wear the mask of the grotesque It is ironic that one fears it the more one admires it I must confess that I admire deaths negativity It is the only thing I can admire and yet not love Its grandeur and infinity impress me but my despair is so vast that I dont even harbor the hope of death How could I love death One can only write about it in contradictory ways Whoever says that he knows something definite about death shows that he has not even a premonition although he bears it within himself Every man bears with him not only his life but also his death Life is just a long drawnout agony It seems to me that sadness partakes of this agony The writhings of sadness dont they express agony These contortions negations of beauty betray so much solitude that one must ask oneself if the physiognomy of sadness is not a mode of objectifying death in life Sadness is a way into a mystery a mystery so rich that sadness never ceases to remain enigmatic If there were a scale for mysteries sadness would belong to a group of infinite mysteries mysteries without limit inexhaustible AN OBSERVATION which to my great regret is always verifiable only those are happy who never think or rather who only think about lifes bare necessities and to think about such things means not to think at all True thinking resembles a demon who muddies the spring of life or a sickness which corrupts its roots To think all the time to raise questions to doubt your own destiny to feel the weariness of living to be worn out to the point of exhaustion by thoughts and life to leave behind you as symbols of your lifes drama a trail of smoke and blood all this means you are so unhappy that reflection and thinking appear as a curse causing a violent revulsion in you There are many things on could regret in this world in which one shouldnt regret any thing But I ask myself Is the world worthy of my regrets Total Dissatisfaction Why this curse on some of us who can never feel at ease anywhere neither in the sun nor out of it neither with men nor without them Ignorant of good humor an amazing achievement Those who have no access to irresponsibility are the most wretched To possess a high degree of consciousness to be always aware of yourself in relation to the world to live in the permanent tension of knowledge means to be lost for life Knowledge is the plague of life and consciousness an open wound in its heart Is it not tragic to be man that perpetually dissatisfied animal suspended between life and death Im weary of being a man If I could I would renounce my condition on the spot but what would I become then an animal I cannot retrace my steps Besides I might become an animal who knows the history of philosophy As to becoming superman that seems to me utter and ridiculous folly Could there be a solution approximate of course in a sort of superconsciousness Couldnt one live beyond not just on this side toward animality all complex forms of consciousness anxiety agony in a sphere of life where access to eternity would no longer be pure myth As far as I am concerned I resign from humanity I no longer want to be nor can still be a man What should I do Work for a social and political system make a girl miserable Hunt for weaknesses in philosophical systems fight for moral and esthetic ideals Its all too little I renounce my humanity even though I may find myself alone But am I not already alone in this world from which I no longer expect anything Beyond presentday common ideals and forms one might breathe in a superconsciousness where the intoxication of eternity would do away with the qualms of this world and where being would be just as pure and immaterial as nonbeing The Bath of Fire There are so many ways to achieve the sensation of immateriality that it would be difficult if not futile to make a classification Nevertheless I think that the bath of fire is one of the best The bath of fire your being ablaze all flashes and sparks consumed by flames as in Hell The bath of fire purifies so radically that it does away with existence Its heat waves and scorching flames burn the kernel of life smothering its vital elan turning its aggressiveness into aspiration To live in a bath of fire transfigured by its rich glow such is the state of immaterial purity where one is nothing but a dancing flame Freed from the laws of gravity life becomes illusion or dream But this is not all at the end a most curious and paradoxical sensation occurs the feeling of dreamy unreality gives way to the sensation of becoming ash The bath of fire invariable ends thus when the inner conflagration has scorched the ground of your being when all is ashes what else is there left to experience There is both mad delight and infinite irony in the thought of my ashes scattered to the four winds sown frenetically in space an eternal reproach to the world Disintegration Not everybody loses his innocence therefore not everybody is unhappy Those who live naively not out of stupidity innocence is a pure state which excludes such deficiencies but out of instinctive and organic love for nature whose charm innocence is always quick to discover those are the ones who achieve harmony an integration with life much coveted by those who struggle on the heights of despair Disintegration implies total loss of innocence that lovely gift destroyed by knowledge lifes enemy Rich ground for love and enthusiasm innocence is delight in the natural charm of being and the unconscious experience of contradictions which no longer have a tragic character To attain the virginal joy of innocence one must not live contradictions consciously or know tragedy and thoughts of death because such knowledge is baffling complex and requires disjunction Innocence resists tragedy but welcomes love because the innocent never troubled by inner contradictions have generous impulses For the man who has cut himself off from life tragedy is intensely painful because contradictions arise not only inside himself but also between him and the rest of the world There are only two fundamental attitudes the naive and the heroic All the others partake of them One must choose between these two in order to avoid idiocy But for the man who has come to make such a choice innocence is no longer an option so there remains only heroism The latter is both a privilege and a curse for those severed from life incapable of fulfillment and happiness To be a hero in the most universal sense of the word means to aspire to absolute triumph But such triumphs come only through death Heroism means transcending life it is a fatal leap into nothingness even though the hero may not be aware that his energy springs from a life deprived of its normal supports All that is innocence and does not lead to it belongs to nothingness Can one speak of the seductions of nothingness If we do we must add that they are much too mysterious to penetrate On The Reality of The Body I can never understand why so many have called the body an illusion just as I will never understand how they could imagine spirituality outside the drama of life with all its contradictions and shortcomings It must be that they were never aware of the flesh the nerves each organ in itself But while I do not understand this lack of awareness I believe it is a necessary condition for happiness Those still attached to lifes irrationality and still enthralled by its organic rhythms prior to the birth of consciousness are ignorant of the state in which the reality of the body is everpresent to consciousness This presence denotes a fundamental existential illness Is it not an illness to be constantly aware of your nerves your feet your stomach your heart every single part of your being With this awareness havent the organs abandoned normal functions The reality of the body is one of the most terrible realities What would the spirit be without the torments of the flesh and consciousness without a great nervous sensibility How could one imagine life without the body as a free and unconditional existence of the spirit Only healthy and irresponsible men who have no spirit could think this The spirit is the offspring of an existential illness and Man is a sick animal Spirit in life is an anomaly I have renounced so much why should I not renounce spirit as well But besides being an illness of life is not renunciation first and foremost an illness of the spirit I Do Not Know I do not know what is right and what is wrong what is allowed and what is not I cannot judge and I cannot praise There are no valid criteria and no consistent principles in the world It surprises me that some people still concern themselves with a theory of knowledge To tell the truth I couldnt care less about the relativity of knowledge simply because the world does not deserve to be known At times I feel as if I had total knowledge exhausting the content of this world at other times the world around me does not make any sense Everything then has a bitter taste there is in me a devilish monstrous bitterness that renders even death insipid I realize now for the first time how hard it is to define this bitterness It may be that Im wasting my time trying to establish a theoretical basis for it when in fact it originates in a pretheoretical zone At this moment I do not believe in anything and I have no hope All forms and expressions that give life its charm seem to me meaningless I have no feeling either for the future or for the past while the present seems to me poison I do not know whether I am desperate or not since lack of hope does not automatically imply despair I could be called anything because I stand to lose nothing Ive lost everything Flowers are blooming and birds are singing all around me How distant I am from everything On Individual and Cosmic Loneliness One can experience loneliness in two ways by feeling lonely in the world or by feeling the loneliness of the world Individual loneliness is a personal drama one can feel lonely even in the midst of great natural beauty An outcast in the world indifferent to its being dazzling or dismal selfconsumed with triumphs and failures engrossed in inner drama such is the fate of the solitary The feeling of cosmic loneliness on the other hand stems not so much from mans subjective agony as from an awareness of the worlds isolation of objective nothingness It is as if all the splendors of this world were to vanish at once leaving behind the dull monotony of a cemetery Many are haunted by the vision of an abandoned world encased in glacial solitude untouched by even the pale reflections of a crepuscular light Who is more unhappy He who feels his own loneliness or he who feels the loneliness of the world Impossible to tell and besides why should I bother with a classification of loneliness Is it not enough that one is alone I leave IT in writing for those who will come after me that I do not believe in anything and that forgetfulness is the only salvation I would like to forget everything to forget myself and to forget the world True confessions are written with tears only But my tears would drown the world as my inner fire would reduce it to ashes I dont need any support encouragement or consolation because although I am the lowest of men I feel nonetheless so strong so hard so savage For I am the only man who lives without hope the apex of heroism and paradox The ultimate madness I should channel my chaotic and unbridled passion into forgetfulness escaping spirit and consciousness I too have a hope a hope for absolute forgetfulness But is it hope or despair Is it not the negation of all future hopes I want not to know not to know even that I do not know Why so many problems arguments vexations Why the consciousness of death How much longer all this thinking and philosophizing Apocalypse How I would love one day to see all people young and old sad or happy men and women married or not serious or superficial leave their homes and their work places relinquish their duties and responsibilities gather in the streets and refuse to do anything anymore At that moment let slaves to senseless work who have been toiling for future generations under the dire delusion that they contribute to the good of humanity avenge themselves on the mediocrity of a sterile and insignificant life on the tremendous waste that never permitted spiritual transfiguration At that moment when all faith and resignation are lost let the trappings of ordinary life burst once and for all Let those who suffer silently not even uttering a sigh of complaint yell with all their might making a strange menacing dissonant clamor that would shake the earth Let the waters flow faster and the mountains sway threateningly the trees show their roots like an eternal and hideous reproach the birds croak like ravens and the animals scatter in fright and fall from exhaustion Let ideals be declared void beliefs trifles art a lie and philosophy a joke Let everything be climax and anticlimax Let lumps of earth leap into the air and crumble in the wind let plants make strange arabesques frightful and distorted shapes in the sky Let wildfires spread rapidly and a terrifying noise drown out everything so that even the smallest animal would know that the end is near Let all form become formless and chaos swallow the structure of the world in a gigantic maelstrom Let there be tremendous commotion and noise terror and explosion and then let there be eternal silence and total forgetfulness And in those final moments let all that humanity has felt until now hope regret love despair and hatred explode with such force that nothing is left behind Would not such moments be the triumph of nothingness and the final apotheosis of nonbeing The Monopoly of Suffering I ask myself Why is it that only some people suffer Why are only some selected from the ranks of normal people and put on the torture rack Some religions maintain that God is trying us through suffering or that we expiate evil and unbelief through it If such an explanation can satisfy the religious man it is not sufficient for anyone who notices that suffering is arbitrary and unjust because the innocent often suffer most There is no valid justification for suffering Suffering has no hierarchy of values The most interesting aspect of suffering is the sufferers belief in its absoluteness He believes he has a monopoly on suffering I think that I alone suffer that I alone have the right to suffer although I also realize that there are modalities of suffering more terrible than mine pieces of flesh falling from the bones the body crumbling under ones very eyes monstrous criminal shameful sufferings One asks oneself How can this be and if it be how can one still speak of finality and other such old wives tales Suffering moves me so much that I lose all my courage I lose heart because I do not understand why there is suffering in the world Its origin in lifes bestiality irrationality and demonism explains the presence of suffering in the world but does not justify it Or maybe suffering has no more justification than life Was life necessary Or is its rationale purely immanent Why should we not reconcile ourselves to the final triumph of nonbeing to the thought that existence advances toward nothingness and being toward nonbeing Isnt nonbeing the last absolute reality This is as challenging a paradox as that of the world Although suffering moves me and sometimes even delights me never could I write the apologia of suffering because long lasting suffering and all genuine suffering is longlasting though purifying in its first phases unhinges the reason dulls the senses and finally destroys Facile enthusiasm for suffering is professed only by esthetes and dilettantes of suffering those who mistake it for entertainment and who do not understand that there is in suffering both poison a formidable destructive energy and a rich fertility dearly paid for To have the monopoly of suffering is to live suspended above the abyss All suffering is an abyss THOSE WHO MAINTAIN that suicide is an assertion of life are cowards They invent explanations and excuses to mask their impotence and lack of daring for in fact there can be no willed or rational decision to commit suicide only organic secret causes which predetermine it Those who commit suicide have a pathological attraction for death which they try to resist consciously but which they cannot totally suppress Life in them is so unbalanced that no rational argument could set it right There are no rational suicides following to a logical conclusion a meditation on nothingness and the futility of life If one argues that there were wise men in antiquity who committed suicide in solitude I reply that they could do so only because they had already stifled life in themselves To meditate on death and on similar dangerous topics is to deal life a mortal blow for the mind contemplating so many agonizing questions must already have been wounded No one commits suicide for external reasons only because of inner disequilibrium Under similar adverse circumstances some are indifferent some are moved some are driven to suicide To be obsessed with suicide there must be such inner agony that all selfimposed barriers break and nothing is left but a catastrophic dizziness a strange and powerful whirlwind How could suicide be an assertion of life They say that it is caused by disappointments which implies that you have desired life that you had expectations which it did not fulfill A false dialectic As if the suicide did not live before he died did not have hopes ambitions pain Essential to suicide is the belief that you can no longer live not because of whim but because of a terrifying inner tragedy Is the inability live an assertion of life Any suicide is impressive So I wonder why people still look for reasons and justifications why the even deprecate it Nothing is more ridiculous than to make a hierarchy of suicides and divide them between the noble and the vulgar Taking ones life is sufficiently impressive to forestall any petty hunt for motives I despise those who scoff at suicides committed for love because they do not understand that to the lover unfulfilled love is the cancellation of his being a destructive plunge into meaninglessness Unrealized passions lead to death faster than great failures Great failures are slow agony but great passions that are thwarted kill like a bolt of lightning I admire only two types of people the potentially mad and the potential suicide Only they inspire me with awe because only they are capable of great passions and great spiritual transfigurations Those who live positively full of selfassurance content with their past present and future have only my respect Why dont I commit suicide Because I am as sick of death as I am of life I should be cast into a flaming caldron Why am I on this earth I feel the need to cry out to utter a savage scream that will set the world atremble with dread I am like a lightning bolt ready to set the world ablaze and swallow it all in the flames of my nothingness I am the most monstrous being in history the beast of the apocalypse full of fire and darkness of aspirations and despair I am the beast with a contorted grin contracting down to illusion and dilating toward infinity both growing and dying delightfully suspended between hope for nothing and despair of everything brought up among perfumes and poisons consumed with love and hatred killed by lights and shadows My symbol is the death of light and the flame of death Sparks die in me only to be reborn as thunder and lightning Darkness itself glows in me Absolute Lyricism I would like to explode flow crumble into dust and my disintegration would be my masterpiece I would like to melt in the world and for the world to melt orgasmically in me and thus in our delirium to engender an apocalyptic dream strange and grandiose like all crepuscular visions Let our dream bring forth mysterious splendors and triumphant shadows let a general conflagration swallow the world and let its flames generate crepuscular pleasures as intricate as death and as fascinating as nothingness Lyricism reaches its ultimate form of expression only through delirium Absolute lyricism is the lyricism of last moments In it expression becomes reality ceasing to be a partial minor and unrevealing objectification Not only your intelligence and your sensitivity but your entire being your life and your body participate in it Absolute lyricism is destiny which has reached absolute selfknowledge Such lyricism will never take an objective and separate form for it is your own flesh and blood It only emerges at those crucial moments when experience is expression Deaths only form is its experience Thus lyricism is a juxtaposition of act and reality because the act is no longer a manifestation of reality but reality itself Absolute lyricism is beyond poetry and sentimentalism and closer to a metaphysics of destiny in general it tends to put everything on the plane of death All important things bear the sign of death The feeling of utter confusion Not to be able to differentiate clarify understand or appreciate Such a feeling would make any philosopher a poet but not all philosophers experience it with significant and durable intensity for if they did they could no longer philosophize abstractly and rigidly How a philosopher becomes a poet is like a drama You fall from a world of abstractions into a whirlwind of feelings into all the fantastic shapes and figures entangled in the soul How could the actor of a complicated drama of the soul in which all at once erotic anticipation clashes with metaphysical anxiety fear of death with desire for innocence total renunciation with paradoxical heroism despair with pride forebodings of madness with longings for anonymity screams with silence aspiration with nothingness how could he still go on philosophizing in a systematic way There are men who started in the world of abstract forms and ended in absolute confusion Therefore they can only philosophize poetically In the state of absolute confusion only the delights and torments of madness still matter The Meaning of Grace There are many ways to transcend our blind attachment to life but only through grace do we not break with its irrational forces it alone is a futile leap a disinterested elan which does not spoil lifes naive charm Grace is the joy of soaring upward The undulations of graceful movements bespeak light and immaterial flight They have the spontaneity of wings beating in the air of smiles of pure young dreams Isnt dance graces best form of expression In grace life is a flux of pure vitality never breaking the harmony of its own rhythms Life becomes dream disinterested play expansion contained in its own borders Thus it creates a pleasant illusion of freedom spontaneous abandon dreams wrought in sunlight Despair is the paroxysm of individuation a painful and unique interiorization Grace on the other hand leads to harmony and naive fulfillment and the graceful being never experiences feelings of loneliness and isolation Grace is an illusory state in which life negates its antinomies and transcends its demonic dialectic in which contradictions fatality and the consciousness of the irrevocable temporarily vanish Light and airy grace sublimates but never purifies because it never reaches the heights of the sublime Ordinary experiences never carry life to heights of delirious tension or to the edge of inner abyss nor do they free it from that symbol of death the law of gravity Grace however is emancipation from the law emancipation from subterraneous temptations from lifes demonic claws its negative tendencies Transcending negativity is the essential characteristic of grace It is not surprising then that in a state of grace life appears more luminous draped in sparkling rays By transcending all negatives and demons through harmony and lightness of being grace ascends to a state of wellbeing faster than religious faith which attains it through suffering and strife What diversity there is in this world for right next to grace there is permanent fear the torture of many   He who has not experienced absolute fear universal anxiety cannot understand struggle the madness of the flesh and of death He who has known only grace cannot understand the anxiety of the sick Only sickness gives birth to serious and deep feelings Whatever is not born out of sickness has only an esthetic value To be ill means to live willingly or not on the heights of despair But such heights presuppose deep chasms fearful precipices to live on the heights means to live near the abyss One must fall in order to reach the heights But grace is a state of contentment even happiness and it knows neither abyss nor agony Why are women happier than men Is it not because in them grace and innocence are more common than in men They too are affected by sickness and dissatisfaction but grace predominates Their naive grace confers on them a state of superficial equilibrium which never leads to tragic and dangerous tensions Women are safe on the spiritual plane because in them the dualism between life and the spirit is less intense than in men A graceful sense of existence does not lead to metaphysical revelations to a vision of truth to the sense of an ending which poisons every moment of life Women are ciphers the more you think about them the less you understand them In front of women one is silent just as one is silent in contemplation of the worlds secret essence But where the latter is unfathomable infinity the former is simple mystery in other words void Not greatly disjoined from life woman is a temporary salvation for those on the heights of despair because through her a return to lifes unconscious and innocent pleasures is still possible Grace if it has not saved the world has saved its women The Vanity of Compassion How can one still have ideals when there are so many blind deaf and mad people in the world How can I remorselessly enjoy the light another cannot see or the sound another cannot hear I feel like a thief of light Have we not stolen light from the blind and sound from the deaf Isnt our very lucidity responsible for the madmans darkness When I think about such things I lose all courage and will thoughts seem useless and compassion vain For I do not feel mediocre enough to feel compassion for anyone Compassion is a sign of superficiality broken destinies and unrelenting misery either make you scream or turn you to stone Pity is not only inefficient it is also insulting And besides how can you pity another when you yourself suffer ignominously Compassion is as common as it is because it does not bind you to anything Nobody in this world has yet died from anothers suffering And the one who said that he died for us did not die he was killed Eternity and Morality Even today nobody can tell what is right or what is wrong It will be the same in the future The relativity of such expressions means little not to be able to dispense with their use is more significant I dont know what is right and what is wrong and yet I divide actions into good and bad If anyone asked me why I do so I couldnt give an answer I use moral criteria instinctively later when I reconsider I do not find any justifications for having done so Morality has become so complex and contradictory because its values no longer constitute themselves in the order of life but have crystallized in a transcendental region only feebly connected to lifes vital and irrational forces How does one go about founding a morality Im so sick of the word good it is so stale and vapid Morality tells you to work for the triumph of goodness And how Through the fulfillment of ones duties respect sacrifice These are just empty words in front of naked reality moral principles are void so much so that one wonders whether life without them would not be preferable I would love a world free of forms and principles a world of absolute indeterminacy I like to imagine a world of fantasy and dream where talk of right and wrong would no longer make sense Since reality is essentially irrational why set rules why distinguish the right from the wrong Morality cannot be saved its a mistake to believe otherwise Yet there are those who maintain that in this world pleasure and sin are minor satisfactions which enjoy only a brief triumph and that only good deeds partake of eternity They pretend that at the end of this worlds misery goodness and virtue will win but they have failed to see that if eternity obliterates superficial pleasures it does the same with virtue good deeds and moral actions Eternity does not lead to the triumph of either good or evil it ravages all It is silly to condemn the Epicureans in the name of eternity How is suffering rather than pleasure going to make me immortal From a purely objective point of view is there any significant difference between one mans agony and anothers pleasure Whether you suffer or not nothingness will swallow you forever There is no objective road to eternity only a subjective feeling experienced at irregular moments in time Nothing created by man will endure Why this intoxication with moral illusions when there are other illusions even more beautiful Those who speak of moral salvation in the face of eternity refer to the moral actions indefinite echo in time its unlimited resonance Nothing could be less true since socalled virtuous men are actually cowards who will disappear from the worlds consciousness faster than those who have wallowed in pleasure And even so supposing the opposite were true would a dozen or more years really count Any unsatisfied pleasure is a loss of life I shall not be the one to preach against pleasure orgy and excess in the name of suffering Let the mediocre speak of the consequences of pleasure are not those of suffering even greater Only the mediocre want to die of old age Suffer then drink pleasure to its last dregs cry or laugh scream in despair or with joy sing about death or love for nothing will endure Morality can only make life a long series of missed opportunities Moment and Eternity Eternity can be understood only as subjective experience It cannot be conceived objectively because mans temporal finitude prevents him from grasping the concept of infinity as an unlimited process in time The experience of eternity therefore depends on intensity of subjective feeling and the way to eternity is to transcend the temporal One must fight hard against time so that once the mirage of the succession of moments is overcome one can live fully the instant one is launched into eternity How does the instant become a gate to eternity A sense of becoming results from the moments insufficiency and relativity those with a keen consciousness of temporality live every moment thinking of the next one Eternity can be attained only if there are no connections if one lives the instant totally and absolutely Every experience of eternity presupposes a leap and a transfiguration and few and far between are those capable of the tension necessary to arrive at the blissful contemplation of the eternal It is not the length but the intensity of contemplation that matters The return to normal will not impair the richness of this fertile experience On the other hand the frequency with which such contemplations occur matters greatly only through frequent repetition can one experience the intoxication of eternity the delights of its luminous extraterrestrial transcendence By isolating the moment from its successions you confer upon it subjectively an absolute value From the point of view of eternity time with its long train of individual moments is if not unreal irrelevant There are no hopes or regrets in eternity To live each moment in itself is to escape the relativity of taste and category to break free from the immanence in which time has imprisoned us Immanent living is impossible without simultaneous living in time without temporality life loses its dramatic character The more intense the life the more revealing its time Moreover life consists of a great number of directions of goals and intentions which can only be achieved in time When speaking of life you say moments of eternity moment The experience of eternity is void of life a conquest of time a victory over the moments of life Those with an inborn contemplative sense of eternity uncontaminated as we are by temporality as for example in certain Oriental cultures know nothing of our dramatic struggle to conquer time Still the contemplation of eternity is for us a source of conquering visions and strange delights One cannot love eternity the way one loves a woman ones destiny or ones despair for there is in the love of eternity the attraction of the peace of sidereal light History and Eternity Why should I live in history or worry about the social and cultural problems of the age I am weary of culture and history I can no longer bring myself to embrace its torments and its aspirations We must outstrip history and we can do so only when past present and future cease to be important when where and when we live becomes a matter of indifference Am I much better off because I live today rather than four thousand years ago in Ancient Egypt It is silly to pity those who lived in times we dont like who did not know Christianity or the discoveries of modern science Since there is no hierarchy of lifestyles everybody and nobody is right all at the same time Each historical epoch is a world in itself closed off and certain of its principles until the dialectic movement of historical life creates a new equally limited and deficient form I am surprised that some people study the past when the whole of history strikes me as null and void Of what interest are the ideals and beliefs of our ancestors Mankinds achievements could very well be great but I do not care to know them I take greater comfort in the contemplation of eternity In this world not worth so much as a breath the only valid relation is that between man and eternity not between man and history No one negates history out of a passing whim but only under the impact of harrowing and unsuspected tragedies Such negations spring from great sadness not from merely abstract meditations on history Now that I no longer want to take part in history and I negate the past of humanity a deadly sadness painful beyond imagination preys upon me Has it been long dormant and just now awakened by these thoughts There is in me the bitter taste of death and nothingness is burning within me like a strong poison How could I still speak of beauty and make esthetic remarks when I am so sad sad unto death I do not want to know anything more By outstripping history one acquires superconsciousness an important ingredient of eternity It takes you into the realm where contradictions and doubts lose their meaning where you forget about life and death It is the fear of death that launches men on their quest for eternity its only advantage is forgetfulness But what about the return from eternity Not to Be a Man Anymore I am more and more persuaded that man is an unhappy animal abandoned and forced to find his own way in life Nature has never known anything like him He suffers a thousandfold more from his socalled freedom than from his imprisonment in natural existence Not surprisingly he often longs to be a flower or some other plant When you come to a point where you want to live like a plant fully unconscious then you have come to despair of humanity But why shouldnt I exchange places with a flower I already know what it means to be man to live in history have ideals what else is in it for me To be a man is of course a great thing But it is mainly a tragedy because to be human means to live in a totally different way more complex and more dramatic than natural existence Lifes tragic character gradually disappears as you go down the scale toward the inanimate realm Man tends to monopolize tragedy and suffering in the world thats why salvation for him is a burning insoluble question I am not proud to be a man because I know only too well what it is to be man Only those who have not experienced this state intensely are proud of it because they intend to become men Their delight is natural there are among men some who are not far above plants or animals and therefore aspire to humanity But those who know what it means to be Man long to be anything but If I could I would choose every day another form plant or animal I would be all flowers one by one weed thistle or rose a tropical tree with a tangle of branches seaweed cast by the shore or mountain whipped by winds bird of prey a croaking bird or a bird with melodious song beast of the forest or tame animal Let me live the life of every species wildly and un selfconsciously let me try out the entire spectrum of nature let me change gracefully discreetly as if it were the most natural procedure How I would search the nests and caves wander the deserted mountains and the sea the hills and the plains Only a cosmic adventure of this kind a series of metamorphoses in the plant and animal realms would reawaken in me the desire to become Man again If the difference between Man and animal lies in the fact that the animal can only be an animal whereas man can also be notman that is something other than himselfthen I am notman Magic and Fatality It is hard for me to imagine the joy of people with magical sensitivity those people who feel that everything is within their power for whom there are no obstacles Magical sensitivity leads only to joy it knows nothing of the irrevocability and fatality of existence To feel that you can do anything that you can hold the absolute in the palm of your hand that your exuberance is one with the worlds that you are the world and that its heart beats in you frenetically these are the ingredients of an unimaginable joy the exclusive monopoly of those possessed of magical sensitivity Magic knows nothing of illnesses or if it does they are never incurable ones Magical optimism finds equivalences in everything Magic rejects the negative demonic essence of life He who has this kind of sensitivity cannot understand the triumphs of pain misery destiny death The illusions of magic negate the irrevocable reject the inevitability and universality of death Subjectively magic is very important because it leads to a state of euphoric exaltation In it man lives as if he were never to die The question of death consists of nothing but the subjective consciousness of death For those who do not have it it is totally irrelevant that through death they will fall into nothingness We reach the climax of consciousness through incessant contemplation of death Infinitely more complex are those who are conscious of fatality for whom the insoluble and the irrevocable are real who feel that effort is vain and regret impossible Essential reality unfolds under the sign of fatality lifes inability to overcome its limited condition Magic is useful for small and inessential things but powerless when confronted with metaphysical reality which requires most of the time silence something magical sensitivity is incapable of To live with an acute consciousness of fatality of ones own impotence in the face of lifes great problems which you cannot even pose without tragically implicating yourself in existence means to engage directly the capital question of life that of inaccessible and unknowable infinity Unimaginable Joy You pretend that despair and agony are only preliminaries that ideally one should overcome them if one is not to become an automaton You think joy is the only means of salvation and you despise all others You call the obsession with agony selfishness and find generous impulses only in joy You offer us this joy but how can we receive it from the outside As long as it does not spring from our inner resources help from the outside is quite useless How easy it is to recommend joy to those who cannot be joyful How can one haunted by madness be joyful Do all those who are so eager to promote joy realize what it means to feel and fear madness closing in to live all your life with the tormenting presentiment of madness to which is added the even more persistent and certain consciousness of death Joy may very well be a state of bliss but it can only be reached naturally There may be an end to our agony and we may still be destined to attain peaceful and serene bliss Should the gates of Eden be closed to me forever I have not yet found their key Since we cannot be joyful there only remains the road of agony of mad exaltation Let us live the agony fully let us live our inner tragedy absolutely and frenetically to the very end All we have left is paroxysm and when it subsides there will be just one wisp of smoke    our inner fire will ravish all Pure and generous in no need of praise or justification joy is unwarranted in the face of despair It does not do anything for the organically desperate while for others it is so seductive that it needs no excuses The complexity of absolute despair is infinitely greater than that of absolute joy Is it for this reason that the gates of Eden are forbidden to those who have lost hope The Ambiguity of Suffering There is no one who after having endured pain or sickness does not experience the slightest vaguest twinge of regret Although longing to recover those who suffer intensely for a long time sense an irreparable loss in their improvement If pain is part of your being overcoming it is like a loss and causes a pang of regret I owe to suffering the best parts of myself as well as all that I have lost in life Therefore I cannot either curse or love suffering My feeling for it is hard to describe it is strange elusive and has the mysterious charm of twilight Beatitude through suffering is an illusion since it requires a reconciliation to the fatality of pain in order to avoid total annihilation Lifes last resources smolder under this illusion The only concession to suffering hides in our regret of potential recovery but it is so vague and elusive a feeling that it cannot stamp itself on anyones consciousness All disappearing pains carry with them this vague discomfort as if the return to equilibrium forbade the path to alluring yet tormenting realms from which one cannot part without a final backward glance Since suffering has not revealed Beauty to us what lights still attract our eye Are we drawn by the gloom of suffering All Is Dust There are so many reasons to reject life that it would be impossible to enumerate them all despair death and infinity are only the most obvious But there are also an equal number of inner subjective causes for where life is concerned there is no true or false only our spontaneous reactions One might call it subjectivism What does it matter Isnt intense subjectivity the way to attain universality exactly as one enters eternity through the instant Men value solitude so little They condemn the sterility of all that it has produced and give praise exclusively to social values for they cherish the illusion that they have all contributed to their creation They all aspire to great achievements through which they hope to attain immortality As if they will not crumble into dust I AM DISPLEASED with everything If they made me God I would immediately resign and if the world were just me I would sunder myself apart burst into tiny pieces and disappear How can there be moments when I feel as if I understand it all Enthusiasm as a Form of Love There are pure limpid forms of life undisclosed to those living under the sign of despair Those whose life flows without obstacles reach a stage of delightful contentment in which the world appears charming and full of light Enthusiasm casts a bewitching light over the world it is a specific form of love a way of forgetting oneself Love has so many faces so many aspects and so many deviations that it is hard to find a typical form for it Any science of love will look first for loves original manifestation As one speaks of love between the sexes love of God for nature or for art one can also speak of enthusiasm as a form of love Which form is the essential one from which all others derive Theologians maintain that it is the love of God and that all other manifestations are but pale reflections of this fundamental love Pantheists with esthetic tendencies believe that it is the love of nature and pure esthetes the love of art Similarly for biologists it is pure sexuality without affection and for metaphysicians it is the feeling of universal identity Yet not one of them will be able to prove that the form he defends is the most typical because in the course of history that form has varied so much that nobody today could define it with any certainty As for me I believe that the quintessential form of love is that between a man and a woman not only sexuality but a rich network of affective states Has anyone ever committed suicide in the name of God nature or art Love grows in intensity when it fastens on the concrete one loves a woman for what makes her different unique in the world nothing can replace her at the height of passion All other forms of love though tending toward autonomy participate in this essential form Thus one generally does not place enthusiasm in the realm of love when in fact its roots penetrate deep into the very substance of love its emancipating tendencies notwithstanding There is in the enthusiastic man a universal receptivity an ability to gather everything with a surplus of energy which spends itself just for the pleasure of acting The enthusiast heeds no criteria makes no calculations he is all abandon restlessness and devotion The joy of achieving and the ecstasy of efficiency are the essential characteristics of the man for whom life is a leap toward heights where destructive forces lose their negative intensity We all have moments of enthusiasm but they are too rare to stamp us permanently I am referring to people in whom enthusiasm is predominant and constitutes the essential mark of their personality They do not know defeat because it is not the goal but the initiative and pleasure of acting that attracts them they throw themselves into action not because they have meditated upon its consequences but simply because they cannot help it Although not altogether impervious to success the enthusiast is neither stimulated by it nor defeated by its absence He is the last one to fail in this world Life is more mediocre and fragmentary than we think isnt this the reason for our decline the loss of our vivacity the hardening of our inner rhythms the gradual slowing down of our vital flow This process of waste destroys our receptivity and our willingness to embrace life generously and enthusiastically The enthusiast alone preserves his energy until old age all others if not already born dead like most people die before their time How rare the true enthusiast Can we imagine a world in which everybody will love everything a world of enthusiasts Such an image is even more alluring than the image of paradise because its excesses of generosity surpass any of those in Eden The enthusiasts ability to be constantly reborn raises him above lifes demoniacal temptations the fear of nothingness and the torments of agony His life has no tragic dimension because enthusiasm is the only form of life totally opaque to death Even grace so similar to enthusiasm has less of this irrational ignorance of death Grace is full of melancholy charm not so enthusiasm My tremendous admiration for enthusiasts stems from my inability to comprehend how there can be such men in a world where death nothingness sadness and despair keep sinister company It makes one wonder to see people who are never desperate How can the enthusiast be indifferent to success How can he act by virtue of excess only What kind of strange and paradoxical form does love take in enthusiasm The more intense love is the more individualized Men who love truly and passionately cannot love several women at once the more intense the love the more important its object Let us imagine a passionate love without an object a man without the woman on whom to concentrate his love what would it be but the plenitude of love Are there men with a great potential for love but who have never loved in this primordial original way Enthusiasm is love with an unspecified object Instead of orienting itself toward others enthusiastic love expends itself lavishly in generous actions with a sort of universal receptivity Enthusiasm is a superior child of Eros Of all the forms of love enthusiasm is the most free of sexuality much more so than mystic love which cannot shed its sexual symbolism Thus enthusiasm is spared the anxiety which makes sexuality play an important part in the human tragedy The enthusiast is preeminently an unproblematic person He understands many things without ever knowing the agonizing doubts and the chaotic sensitivity of the problematic man The latter cannot solve anything because nothing satisfies him You will find in him neither the enthusiasts gift of abandon his naive irrationality nor the charming paradox of love in its purest state The biblical myth of knowledge as sin is the most profound myth ever invented The enthusiasts euphoria is due to the fact that he is unaware of the tragedy of knowledge Why not say it True knowledge is the most tenebrous darkness I would gladly exchange all the harrowing problems of this world for sweet unselfconscious naivete The spirit does not elevate it tears you apart In enthusiasm as in grace and magic the spirit does not oppose life The secret of happiness lies in this original nondivision of an impenetrable unity If you are an enthusiast you do not know that poison duality Life usually preserves its fecundity and productiveness through the tensions and oppositions of agnostic struggle Enthusiasm overcomes it and accedes to a life without tragedy and a love without sexuality Light and Darkness The falsity of all philosophical and historical systems is best illustrated by the erroneous interpretation of the dualism of light and darkness in Oriental and mystical religions Thus some have claimed that men having noticed the regular alternation of day and night equated the former with life and the latter with mystery and death raised light and darkness to the rank of metaphysical principles This interpretation is natural but like all external explications insufficient The question of light and darkness is linked to the question of ecstasy Their dualism acquires an explanatory value only for one who successively enslaved by the forces of light and darkness has known both obsession and captivity Ecstasy mingles shadows and sparks in a weird dance it weaves a dramatic vision of fugitive glimmers in mysterious obscurity playing with all the nuances of light through total darkness Nevertheless this gorgeous display is not as important as the mere fact that it holds and fascinates you The height of ecstasy is the final sensation in which you feel you are dying because of all this light and darkness Especially weird is the fact that ecstasy wipes out surrounding objects familiar forms of the world until ail that is left is a monumental projection of shadow and light It is hard to explain how this selection and purification takes place why these immaterial shadows hold such sway over us Demonism is inherent in any ecstatic exaltation How can we help attributing an absolute character to light and darkness when they are all that is left of the worlds ecstasy The frequency with which ecstasy occurs in Oriental religions as well as in other forms of mysticism at all times proves the rightness of our hypothesis The absolute is inside oneself not outside and ecstasy this paroxysm of interiority reveals only inner shadows and glimmers of light Next to them the charm of light and day fades quickly Ecstasy partakes of essence to such an extent that it gives an impression of metaphysical hallucination Pure essences grasped through ecstasy are immaterial but their immateriality causes vertigo and obsession from which you cannot free yourself except by converting them into metaphysical principles Renunciation So you witnessed old age pain and death and told yourself that pleasure is an illusion and that the pleasure seekers do not understand the inconstancy of things Then you shunned the world persuaded that nothing will endure I will not return you proclaimed before I have escaped birth old age and death There is much pride and suffering in every renunciation Instead of retreating discreetly without a big show of revolt and hatred you denounce emphatically and haughtily others ignorance and illusions you condemn their pleasures The ascetics who renounced life and fled into the desert were convinced that they had overcome all human weaknesses The belief that they had access to a subjective eternity gave them the illusion of total liberation Nonetheless their condemnation of pleasure and their contempt for humanity betray their inability to actually free themselves Were I to withdraw into the most fearsome desert renounce everything and live in absolute solitude still I would never dream of despising men and their pleasure Since I cannot really enter eternity through renunciation and solitude since I shall die like the rest why despise them why call my way the only true one All the great prophets lack discretion and human understanding I witness pain old age death and I know that they cannot be overcome but why should I spoil anothers enjoyment with my knowledge Suffering and the consciousness of its inescapability lead to renunciation yet nothing would induce me not even if I were to become a leper to condemn anothers joy There is much envy in every act of condemnation Buddhism and Christianity are the revenge and the spite of those who suffer Were I in the throes of agony I would still praise and celebrate orgy I do not recommend renunciation because only a few can overcome the thought of lifes inconstancy In society as much as in the wilderness inconstancy will preserve its bitter flavor Just think how much greater were the illusions of great solitaries than those of the innocent and the naive The thought of renunciation is so bitter that it is hard to imagine how man ever came to conceive of it He who in a moment of despair has not experienced a cold shiver a sensation of ineluctable abandonment cosmic death and individual nothingness has not experienced the terrifying preliminaries of renunciation Renounce But how Where should you go in order not to renounce it all at once although that is the only genuine renunciation Actual deserts are not readily available to us in our lands and our climate we lack the adequate milieu Not living under the fierce desert sun with just that one thought about eternity are we to become saints with roofs over our heads Not to be able to renounce except through suicide is a strictly modern drama Were our inner desert to materialize wouldnt its immensity crush us WHY NOT EXPLODE Isnt there enough energy in me to shake the world enough madness to do away with light Isnt chaos my only joy and isnt the elan which will cause my downfall my only pleasure Are not my flights falls and is not my explosion my love Can I only love through selfdestruction Could it be that I am totally forbidden knowledge of the pure states Can there be so much poison in my love Have I not fought death long enough Should Eros also be my enemy Why is it that when love is reborn in me I become so afraid that I am ready to swallow the entire world in order to stop my love from growing My predicament I want to be disappointed in love so that I will have more reasons to suffer Only love reveals to you your true degradation Can the man who has looked death in the face still love Can he still die of love The Blessings of Insomnia Just as ecstasy purifies you of the particular and the contingent leaving nothing except light and darkness so insomnia kills off the multiplicity and diversity of the world leaving you prey to your private obsessions What strangely enchanted tunes gush forth during those sleepless nights Their flowing tones are bewitching but there is a note of regret in this melodic surge which keeps it short of ecstasy What kind of regret It is hard to say because insomnia is so complex that one cannot tell what the loss is Or maybe the loss is infinite During wakeful nights the presence of a single thought or feeling reigns supreme It becomes the source of the nights mysterious music Thus transformed the thoughts of wakeful nights are mild enough to stir depths of universal anxiety in mans soul Death itself although still hideous acquires in the night a sort of impalpable transparency an illusory and musical character Nevertheless the sadness of this universal night is like the sadness of Oriental music in which the mystery of death is more dominant than that of love On the Transubstantiation of Love Irrationality presides over the birth of love The sensation of melting is also present for love is a form of intimate communion and nothing expresses it better than the subjective impression of melting the falling away of all barriers of individuation Isnt love specificity and universality all at once True communion can only be achieved through an individual I love someone but since she is the symbol of everything I partake of the essence of everything unconsciously and naively Loves universality presupposes the specificity of the object of love the individual is a window on the universal Exaltation in love arises from the growth of loves irrationality to a climax of intensity All true love is a peak which sexuality cannot dwarf Sexuality too has its unique peaks However although one cannot conceive of love without sexuality the strange phenomenon we call love displaces sexuality from the center of our consciousness Obsessively purified the beloved acquires an aura of both transcendence and intimacy which makes sexuality marginal if not in fact at least subjectively There is no spiritual love between the sexes only a transfiguration of the flesh through which the beloved identifies herself so much with her lover that she creates an illusion of spirituality Only then does the sensation of melting occur the flesh trembles in a supreme spasm ceases resistance burning with inner fires melting and flowing unstoppable lava Man the Insomniac Animal Whoever said that sleep is the equivalent of hope had a penetrating intuition of the frightening importance not only of sleep but also of insomnia The importance of insomnia is so colossal that I am tempted to define man as the animal who cannot sleep Why call him a rational animal when other animals are equally reasonable But there is not another animal in the entire creation that wants to sleep yet cannot Sleep is forgetfulness lifes drama its complications and obsessions vanish completely and every awakening is a new beginning a new hope Life thus maintains a pleasant discontinuity the illusion of permanent regeneration Insomnia on the other hand gives birth to a feeling of irrevocable sadness despair and agony The healthy man the animal only dabbles in insomnia he knows nothing of those who would give a kingdom for an hour of unconscious sleep those as terrified by the sight of a bed as they would be of a torture rack There is a close link between insomnia and despair The loss of hope comes with the loss of sleep The difference between paradise and hell you can always sleep in paradise never in hell God punished man by taking away sleep and giving him knowledge Isnt deprivation of sleep one of the most cruel tortures practiced in prisons Madmen suffer a lot from insomnia hence their depressions their disgust with life and their suicidal impulses Isnt the sensation typical of wakeful hallucinations of diving into an abyss a form of madness Those who commit suicide by throwing themselves from bridges into rivers or from high rooftops onto pavements must be motivated by a blind desire to fall and the dizzying attraction of abysmal depths MY SOUL is chaos how can it be at all There is everything in me search and you will find out I am a fossil dating from the beginning of the world not all of its elements have completely crystallized and initial chaos still shows through I am absolute contradiction climax of antinomies the last limit of tension in me anything is possible for I am he who at the supreme moment in front of absolute nothingness will laugh Truth What a Word The idea of liberation through the suppression of desire is the greatest foolishness ever conceived by the human mind Why cut life short why destroy it for so little profit as total indifference and the illusion of freedom How dare you speak of life after you have stifled it in yourself I have more respect for the man with thwarted desires unhappy and desperate in love than for the cold and proud philosopher A world full of philosophers what a terrifying prospect They should be all wiped out so that life could go on naturally blindly and irrationally I hate the wisdom of these men unmoved by truths who do not suffer with their nerves their flesh and their blood I like only vital organic truths the offspring of our anxiety Those whose thoughts are alive are always right there are no arguments against them And even if there were they would not last long I wonder how there can still be men searching for the truth Do wise men not yet understand that truth cannot be The Beauty of Flames The beauty of flames lies in their strange play beyond all proportion and harmony Their diaphanous flare symbolizes at once grace and tragedy innocence and despair sadness and voluptuousness Their burning transparence has something of the lightness of great purifications I wish the fiery transcendence would carry me up and throw me into a sea of flames where consumed by their delicate and insidious tongues I would die an ecstatic death The beauty of flames creates the illusion of a pure sublime death similar to the light of dawn Immaterial death in flames is like a burning of light graceful wings Do only butterflies die in flames What about those devoured by the flames within them The Paucity of Wisdom I hate wise men because they are lazy cowardly and prudent To the philosophers equanimity which makes them indifferent to both pleasure and pain I prefer devouring passions The sage knows neither the tragedy of passion nor the fear of death nor risk and enthusiasm nor barbaric grotesque or sublime heroism He talks in proverbs and gives advice He does not live feel desire wait for anything He levels down all the incongruities of life and then suffers the consequences So much more complex is the man who suffers from limitless anxiety The wise mans life is empty and sterile for it is free from contradiction and despair An existence full of irreconcilable contradictions is so much richer and creative The wise mans resignation springs from inner void not inner fire I would rather die of fire than of void The Return to Chaos Let us return to original chaos Let us imagine the primordial din the original vortex Let us throw ourselves into the whirlwind which has preceded the creation of form Let our being tremble with effort and madness in the fiery abyss Let everything be wiped out so that surrounded by confusion and disequilibrium we participate fully in the general delirium retracing our way back from cosmos to chaos from form to swirling gyres The disintegration of the world is creation in reverse an apocalypse upside down but sprung from similar impulses Nobody desires to return to chaos without having first experienced an apocalyptic vertigo How great my terror and my joy at the thought of being dragged into the vortex of initial chaos that pandemonium of paradoxical symmetry the unique geometry of chaos devoid of sense or form In every whirlwind hides a potential for form just as in chaos there is a potential cosmos Let me possess an infinite number of unrealized potential forms Let everything vibrate in me with the universal anxiety of the beginning just awakening from nothingness I can only live at the beginning or the end of this world Irony and SelfIrony Once youve negated everything and done away completely with all forms of existence once nothing can survive in the path of your negativity who can you turn to laughing or crying if not your own self Once you have witnessed the fall of the entire world there is nothing left but for you to fall too The infinite character of irony cancels all of lifes contents Im not speaking here of elegant refined irony born of a sense of superficial pride and superiority the irony some use to show off their detachment from the world but of the tragic bitter irony of despair Genuine irony replaces tears convulsions or even a grotesque and criminal grin There is a great difference between the irony of sufferers and that of lazy superficial people That of the former is the sign of a chronic inability to live innocently connected with a sense of the loss of vital forces whereas that of the latter knows nothing of this irrevocable loss and does not reflect it in consciousness Irony betrays an inner convulsion a deepening of wrinkles the absence of spontaneous love of human communion and understanding It is a veiled contempt despising naive spontaneous gestures because it is beyond the irrational and the naive Nonetheless this irony is envious of naive people Enormously proud and therefore unable to show openly his admiration for simplicity the ironic man envious and poisonous shrinks with spite This bitter tragic irony seems to me more genuine than lighthearted skeptical irony The fact that selfirony is always tragic and agonic is quite revealing Selfirony is made up of sighs not of smiles even though its sighs are stifled Selfirony is an expression of despair Youve lost the world youve lost yourself Henceforth a sinister poisonous burst of laughter haunts your actions at every step and above the ruins of smiling innocence rises the hideous ghost of an agonic grin more contorted than those of primitive masks and more rigid than those on Egyptian statues On Poverty Persuaded that poverty is the human lot I can no longer believe in any doctrine of reform All such doctrines are equally stupid and futile There is no poverty among animals because they live on their own ignorant of hierarchy and exploitation This phenomenon is exclusively human for man alone made his equals his slaves Man alone is capable of so much selfcontempt All the charitable endeavors in this world only manage to bring poverty into greater relief they show it to be more terrible and unintelligible than utter dereliction Poverty like ruins hurts by an absence of humanity and makes one regret that men are unwilling to change that which is well within their power to change Knowing full well that men could abolish poverty you are nevertheless aware of its eternity and you feel a bitter anxiety in which man appears in all his petty inconsequence Poverty in social life is only a pale reflection of mans infinite inner poverty Whenever I think of poverty I lose my desire to live I should throw away my pen and move into the slums where I could relieve poverty better and more efficiently than with a poisonous book Whenever I think of mans abject poverty his rot his spreading gangrene I am gripped by mortal despair Instead of constructing theories and ideologies to deal with poverty man this rational animal should simply give the coat off his back in a gesture of fraternal understanding Poverty in the world compromises man more than anything else and will no doubt bring about the downfall of such a megalomaniac animal In front of poverty Im even ashamed of music The essence of social life is in justice How then should one support any social or political doctrine Poverty destroys everything in life it makes it ghastly disgusting Alongside aristocratic paleness there is the paleness of poverty the former a consequence of refinement the latter of mummification for poverty turns you into a ghost makes shadows out of life twilight creatures like survivors of a cosmic holocaust The convulsions of poverty bear no trace of purification they are all hatred bitterness and flesh gone evil Poverty does not engender a pure angelic soul or an immaculate humility any more than sickness does its humility is venomous evil and vengeful There cannot be a relative rebellion in the face of injustice There can only be eternal rebellion because human poverty is eternal The Flight From the Cross I do not like prophets any more than I like fanatics who have never doubted their mission I measure prophets value by their ability to doubt the frequency of their moments of lucidity Doubt makes them truly human but their doubt is more impressive than that of ordinary people Everything else in them is nothing but absolutism preaching moral didacticism They want to teach others bring them salvation show them the truth change their destinies as if their truths were better than those of the others Only doubt can distinguish prophets from maniacs But isnt it too late for them to doubt The one who thought he was the son of God only doubted at the last moment Christ really doubted not on the mountain but on the cross I am convinced that on the cross Jesus envied the destiny of anonymous men and had he been able to would have retreated to the most obscure corner of the world where no one would have begged him for hope or salvation I can imagine him alone with the Roman soldiers imploring them to take him off the cross pull out the nails and let him escape to where the echo of human suffering would no longer reach him Not because he would suddenly have ceased to believe in his mission he was too enlightened to be a skeptic but because death for others is harder to bear than ones own death Jesus suffered crucifixion because he knew that his ideas could triumph only through his own sacrifice People say for us to believe in you you must renounce everything that is yours and also yourself They want your death as a warranty for the authenticity of your beliefs Why do they admire works written in blood Because such works spare them any suffering while at the same time preserving the illusion of suffering They want to see the blood and tears behind your lines The crowds admiration is sadistic Had Jesus not died on the cross Christianity would not have triumphed Mortals doubt everything except death Christs death was for them the ultimate proof of the validity of Christian principles Jesus could have easily escaped crucifixion or could have given in to the Devil He who has not made a pact with the Devil should not live because the Devil symbolizes life better than God If I have any regrets it is that the Devil has rarely tempted me    but then neither has God loved me Christians have not yet understood that God is farther removed from them than they are from Him I can very well imagine God being bored with men who only know how to beg exasperated by the triviality of his creation equally disgusted with both heaven and earth And I see him taking flight into nothingness like Jesus escaping from the cross    What would have happened if the Roman soldiers had listened to Jesus plea had taken him off the cross and let him escape He would certainly not have gone to some other part of the world to preach but only to die alone without peoples sympathy and tears And even supposing that because of his pride he did not beg for freedom I find it difficult to believe that this thought did not obsess him He must have truly believed that he was the son of God His belief notwithstanding he could not have helped doubting or being gripped by the fear of death at the moment of his supreme sacrifice On the cross Jesus had moments when if he did not doubt that he was the son of God he regretted it He accepted death uniquely so that his ideas would triumph It may very well be that Jesus was simpler than I imagine him that he had fewer doubts and fewer regrets for he doubted his divine origin only at his death We on the other hand have so many doubts and regrets that not one among us would dare dream that he is the son of a god I hate Jesus for his preachings his morality his ideas and his faith I love him for his moments of doubt and regret the only truly tragic ones in his life though neither the most interesting nor the most painful for if we had to judge from their suffering how many before him would also be entitled to call themselves sons of God The Cult of Infinity I cannot speak of infinity without experiencing a double vertigo both external and internal as if suddenly abandoning a well ordered existence I threw myself into a whirlwind and began to move through space at the speed of thought My trajectory tends toward an eternal and inaccessible point The farther this point moves into inconceivable distance the faster the giddy gyrations of the whirlwind Neither bright nor graceful they have the intricate pattern of cosmic flames The world is shaking and trembling spinning at an infernally maddening speed as if the apocalypse were approaching One cannot grasp the meaning of infinity without experiencing this strange vertiginous feeling of the End This is the paradox of infinity it makes the sensation of the end more real while at the same time making it ever more impossible for infinity both in time and space leads to nothing How can we accomplish anything in the future when we have behind us an eternity in which nothing was accomplished If the world had had any meaning it would have been revealed to us by now and we would know it How can I continue to believe that it will be disclosed in the future when it has not been made manifest yet But the world has no meaning irrational at the core it is moreover infinite Meaning is conceivable only in a finite world where one can reach something where there are limits to stop our regression clear points of reference where history moves toward a goal envisioned by the theory of progress Infinity leads to nothing for it is totally provisional Everything is too little when compared to infinity Nobody can have the experience of infinity without spells of dizziness a profound and unforgettable anxiety How can one help being anxious when all is equally infinite Infinity renders impossible any solution to the problem of meaning It gives me demonic pleasure to think that the world lacks meaning because of infinity Whats the use of meaning after all Cant we live without it Universal meaninglessness gives way to ecstatic inebriation an orgy of irrationality Since the world has no meaning let us live Without definite aims or accessible ideals let us throw ourselves into the roaring whirlwind of infinity follow its tortuous path in space burn in its flames love its cosmic madness and total anarchy One must bear within oneself the germs of this cosmic anarchy in order to grasp its meaning To live infinity as well as to meditate a long time upon it is the most terrifying lesson in anarchy and revolt one can ever learn Infinity shakes you to the roots of your being disorganizes you but it also makes you forget the petty the contingent and the insignificant How fortunate that having lost all our hopes we can still leap into infinity dive into boundlessness participate in the universal anarchy of its whirlwind What happiness to be carried away by the madness of this incessant movement and to think less of our death than of our insanity to fulfill a dream of cosmic barbarity and boundless exaltation Let our falling out of this whirlwind not mean gradual extinction but sustain our agony in the chaos of the original maelstrom Let the pathos and drama of infinity come to us once more in the loneliness of death so that our passing away into nothingness will resemble an illumination amplifying the mystery and the meaninglessness of this world One of the principal elements of infinity is its negation of form Absolute becoming infinity destroys anything that is formed crystallized or finished Isnt music the art which best expresses infinity because it dissolves all forms into a charmingly ineffable fluidity Form always tends to complete what is fragmentary and by individualizing its contents to eliminate the perspective of the universal and the infinite thus it exists only to remove the content of life from chaos and anarchy Forms are illusory and beyond their evanescence true reality reveals itself as an intense pulsation The penchant for form comes from love of finitude the seduction of boundaries which will never engender metaphysical revelations Metaphysics like music springs from the experience of infinity They both grow on heights and cause vertigo I have always wondered why those who have produced masterpieces in these domains have not all gone mad Music more than any other art requires so much concentration that one could easily after creative moments lose ones mind All great composers ought to either commit suicide or become insane at the height of their creative powers Are not all those aspiring to infinity on the road to madness Normality abnormality are notions that no longer mean anything Let us live in the ecstasy of infinity let us love that which is boundless let us destroy forms and institute the only cult without forms the cult of infinity Transfiguration of Banality Since I will not die right away nor regain my innocence going through the same routine motions every day is sheer madness Banality must be overcome at all costs and the way cleared for transfiguration How sad to see men bypass themselves neglect their own destiny instead of rekindling the light they carry within them or getting drunk on their abysmal darkness Why not wrench from suffering all that it can yield why not tend a smile until we have reached all the way back to its vital springs We all have hands yet no one thinks of using them to convey absolute expression through their delicate movements We admire hands in paintings we love to talk about their meaning but if they must express our own inner tragedy they remain stiff and awkward To have a spectral hand transparent like an immaterial reflection nervous tense as if in a final spasm     Or if not then a heavy threatening hand cruel and hard Hands should tell us more than words or sighs a smile or a prayer The gift of absolute expression offspring of continuous transfiguration will transform us into a center of light more powerful than the sun itself if not only our hands but also our face and everything else that is stamped with our individuality will participate in it The presence of some people means for others overexcitement lassitude or illumination Such people know neither void nor discontinuity but only the communion through which heights become equally pleasurable and vertiginous I FEEL IN ME a strange restlessness growing and dilating like a regret taking roots like sadness Is it fear of my problematic future or is it fear of my own anxiety I am overcome by anxiety about my own fatality Could I go on living with these obsessions Is all of this life or an absurd dream In me is wrought the grotesque fantasy of a demon The demonic character of this world is concentrated in my anxiety a mingling of regrets twilight dreams sadness and unreality It will not be the perfume of flowers that I scatter on the earth but smoke and dust as after a great cataclysm The Burden of Sadness Is there another sadness besides that of death Definitely not because true sadness is black devoid of charms and dreamless There is greater weariness in sadness than in melancholy and it drives one to disgust with life to acute depression The difference between sadness and pain the former is dominated by reflexivity while the latter is weighed down by the fatal materiality of sensation They both lead only to death never to love or erotic exaltation Eros means unmediated living in the secret necessity of life which given the essential innocence of any erotic experience creates the illusion of liberty To be sad or suffering on the other hand means to be incapable of participating directly and organically in the flux of life Sadness as well as suffering reveals existence for us for only through them do we acquire consciousness of our separation from the objective world that anxiety which confers a tragic character upon our existence Degradation Through Work Men generally work too much to be themselves Work is a curse which man has turned into pleasure To work for works sake to enjoy a fruitless endeavor to imagine that you can fulfill yourself through assiduous labor all that is disgusting and incomprehensible Permanent and uninterrupted work dulls trivializes and depersonalizes Work displaces mans center of interest from the subjective to the objective realm of things In consequence man no longer takes an interest in his own destiny but focuses on facts and things What should be an activity of permanent transfiguration becomes a means of exteriorization of abandoning ones inner self In the modern world work signifies a purely external activity man no longer makes himself through it he makes things That each of us must have a career must enter upon a certain form of life which probably does not suit us illustrates works tendency to dull the spirit Man sees work as beneficial to his being but his fervor reveals his penchant for evil In work man forgets himself yet his forgetfulness is not simple and naive but rather akin to stupidity Through work man has moved from subject to object in other words he has become a deficient animal who has betrayed his origins Instead of living for himself not selfishly but growing spiritually man has become the wretched impotent slave of external reality Where have they all gone ecstasy vision exaltation Where is the supreme madness or the genuine pleasure of evil The negative pleasure one finds in work partakes of the poverty and banality of daily life its pettiness Why not abandon this futile work and begin anew without repeating the same wasteful mistake Is subjective consciousness of eternity not enough It is the feeling for eternity that the frenetic activity and trepidation of work has destroyed in us Work is the negation of eternity The more goods we acquire in the temporal realm the more intense our external work the less accessible and farther removed is eternity Hence the limited perspective of active and energetic people the banality of their thought and actions I am not contrasting work to either passive contemplation or vague dreaminess but to an unrealizable transfiguration nevertheless I prefer an intelligent and observant laziness to intolerable terrorizing activity To awaken the modern world one must praise laziness The lazy man has an infinitely keener perception of metaphysical reality than the active one I AM LURED by faraway distances the immense void I project upon the world A feeling of emptiness grows in me it infiltrates my body like a light and impalpable fluid In its progress like a dilation into infinity I perceive the mysterious presence of the most contradictory feelings ever to inhabit a human soul I am simultaneously happy and unhappy exalted and depressed overcome by both pleasure and despair in the most contradictory harmonies I am so cheerful and yet so sad that my tears reflect at once both heaven and earth If only for the joy of my sadness I wish there were no death on this earth The Sense of Endings I can only speak about the sadness and the joy of the end I love only what reveals itself without reserve or compromise you will never find it anywhere but in the convulsions of heartrending sadness the inebriation and excitement of last moments Is not everything final What is the anxiety of nothingness if not the perverse joy of our final sadness our exalted love for the eternity of nothingness and the transience of existence Can it really be that for us existence means exile and nothingness home I must struggle against myself fly into a rage at my destiny blow up all resistance to my transfiguration let there be only my desire for light and darkness Let each one of my actions be either triumph or fall flight or failure Let life grow and die in me with the speed of a lightning bolt Let not the pettiness and rationality of commonplace existence spoil the pleasures and torments of my inner chaos the tragic delights of my final despair and joy To survive moments of extreme organic tension is not a merit but a mark of imbecility Survive only to return to the banality of existence Survival is equally meaningless after the experience of nothingness and after the paroxysm of sexual pleasure I cant understand why people do not commit suicide during orgasm why they dont think survival commonplace and vulgar Such an intense though brief quiver should reduce us to ashes in seconds But if it does not kill us we should kill ourselves   There are so many kinds of death Yet no one has the courage or the originality to attempt sexual suicide a death no less absolute than the others but in which the passage into nothingness is made from heights of pleasure Why not take this path A flash of bitter lucidity in the forgetfulness of sexual pleasure would suffice for sexual death no longer to appear as mere illusion When men can no longer bear the monotony and the banality of ordinary existence they will find in each experience of the absolute an opportunity to commit suicide The impossibility of surviving such extraordinary states of exaltation will destroy existence No one will then doubt that it is possible to long for death after having listened to certain symphonies or admired a unique landscape Animal banished from life mans condition is tragic for he no longer finds fulfillment in lifes simple values For animals life is all there is for man life is a question mark An irreversible question mark for man has never found nor will ever find any answers Life not only has no meaning it can never have one The Satanic Principle of Suffering If there are happy people on this earth why dont they come out and shout with joy proclaim their happiness in the streets Why so much discretion and restraint If I were exuding permanent joy serenity and contentment I would not hold it all inside me I would generously share it with others I would let myself be swept away by the buoyant energy that animates me If there is happiness then it must be shared and communicated But maybe truly happy people are not aware of their happiness Then we could lend them some of our consciousness in exchange for part of their infinite unconsciousness Why is suffering all tears and screams and pleasure all quivers Were man as conscious of his pleasures as he is of his pains he would not have to redeem the former Wouldnt the distribution of joy and sorrow in the world be more equitable then If pain is not easily forgotten it is precisely because it occupies an important place in consciousness The only people who must forget a lot are those who have suffered a lot Normal people are the only ones with nothing to forget While pains have character pleasures vanish melting away like forms with indistinct contours It is hard to remember pleasure and the circumstances surrounding it while the memory of pain is poignant and that of its circumstances makes it even more so Pleasure cannot be totally forgotten the man of pleasure in his old age will be only slightly disabused while the sufferer will at best arrive at bitter resignation To assert that pleasures are selfish and cut man off from life is as shameful a prejudice as the one which asserts that pains bring us closer to it The frivolity of such prejudices is revolting Their bookish origin indicts all libraries and proves the value of real experience carried out to the end The Christian conception of suffering as a path to love if not its main gate is fundamentally false But isnt Christianity mistaken on more than just this point To speak of suffering as the path to love means to know nothing of sufferings satanic essence You dont climb up the steps of suffering you climb down They do not lead to heaven but to hell The darkness at the bottom of the ladder of suffering is less eternal or infinite than the blinding light at the top of the ladder of joy Suffering separates and dissociates like a centrifugal force it pulls you away from the center of life the hub of the universe where all things tend toward unity The divine principle distinguishes itself by an effort toward cosmic synthesis and participation in the essence of everything The satanic principle on the other hand is a principle of dislocation and duality which characterizes all suffering Through joy spiritual or sensual you naively partake of life unconsciously you join in the dynamism of existence each particle of your body vibrating with the irrational pulsations of the Whole Disjunction from the world through suffering leads to excessive interiorization and paradoxically to such a high level of consciousness that the world with all its splendors and glooms becomes exterior and transcendent Thus deeply sundered from the world so irredeemably lonely how can we forget anything We want to forget only what made us suffer However through some cruel and paradoxical twist memories vanish when we want to remember but fix themselves permanently in the mind when we want to forget Men generally belong to two categories those for whom the world offers opportunities for interiorization and those for whom the world remains external and objective For true interioriza tion objective existence is only a pretext Only as such can it have any meaning at all because an objective teleology cannot be elaborated and justified without a number of illusions whose main defect is that they can easily be detected by a penetrating eye All men see fires storms explosions or landscapes but how many feel the flames the lightnings the whirlwinds or the harmony How many have an inner beauty that tinges their melancholy For the indifferent to whom nature offers an insipid and cold objectivity life even when fully enjoyed is a sum of missed opportunities However painful my agony however great my isolation the distance separating me from the world does nothing but render it more accessible Although I cannot find in it either objective meaning or transcendental finality existence with its multiplicity of forms has never ceased to be a source of both delight and sadness At times the beauty of a flower is enough to justify in my eyes the principle of universal finality while at others the smallest cloud troubling the serenity of the sky rekindles my somber pessimism Those who interiorize excessively discover symbolic meanings in the most insignificant aspects of nature Is it possible that I carry within me all that Ive seen in my life It is frightening to think that all those landscapes books horrors and sublimities could be amassed in one single brain I feel as if they have been transferred into me as realities and that they weigh heavily upon me Sometimes I am overcome and I would prefer to forget all Interiorization leads to inner collapse because the world penetrates you and crushes you with its overbearing weight Is it surprising then that some would have recourse to anything from vulgarity to art in order to forget I have NO ideas only obsessions Anybody can have ideas Ideas have never caused anybodys downfall An Indirect Animal All men have the same defect they wait to live for they have not the courage of each instant Why not invest enough passion in each moment to make it an eternity We all learn to live only when we no longer have anything to expect because we do not live in the living present but in a vague and distant future We should not wait for anything except the immediate promptings of the moment We should wait without the consciousness of time Theres no salvation without the immediate But man is a being who no longer knows the immediate He is an indirect animal Impossible Truth When should our happiness begin When we have persuaded ourselves that there is no truth All salvation comes thenceforth even salvation through nothing He who does not believe in the impossibility of truth or does not rejoice in it has only one road to salvation which he will however never find Subjectivity For those deprived of faith an excess of subjectivity leads either to megalomania or selfdenigration to too much love or too much selfhatred Either way you spend yourself ahead of time Subjectivity makes you either God or Satan Homo Man should stop being or becoming a rational animal He should become a lunatic risking everything for the sake of his dangerous fantasies capable of exaltations ready to die for all that the world has as well as for what it has not Each mans ideal should be to stop being a man This can only be attained through absolute arbitrariness Love in Brief Love of mankind springing from suffering resembles wisdom sprung from misfortune In both cases the roots are rotten and the sources poisoned Only spontaneous love flowing with sincere generosity and selfabnegation can fertilize the soul of others Love born in suffering hides too many tears and sighs not to have its rays stained by a bitter clarity There is too much torment renunciation and anxiety in this love for it to be anything but infinite forbearance You forgive everything you accept everything you justify everything But is this still love How can one love when one is removed from everything This kind of love reveals the void of a soul suspended between all and nothing just as becoming a Don Juan is the only remedy for a broken heart As for Christianity it knows no love it only knows forbearance or compassion allusions to love rather than love itself Nothing Matters Everything is possible and yet nothing is All is permitted and yet again nothing No matter which way we go it is no better than any other It is all the same whether you achieve something or not have faith or not just as it is all the same whether you cry or remain silent There is an explanation for everything and yet there is none Everything is both real and unreal normal and absurd splendid and insipid There is nothing worth more than anything else nor any idea better than any other Why grow sad from ones sadness and delight in ones joy What does it matter whether our tears come from pleasure or pain Love your unhappiness and hate your happiness mix everything up scramble it all Be a snowflake dancing in the air a flower floating downstream Have courage when you dont need to and be a coward when you must be brave Who knows You may still be a winner And if you lose does it really matter Is there anything to win in this world All gain is a loss and all loss is a gain Why always expect a definite stance clear ideas meaningful words I feel as if I should spout fire in response to all the questions which were ever put or not put to me The Sources of Evil How can we fight unhappiness By struggling with ourselves for unhappiness comes from within not from without If we could constantly remind ourselves that everything is nothing but a reflection in our consciousness more or less sharp depending on the acuity of our senses we could then attain a state of lucidity in which reality would resume its true proportions We cannot aspire to happiness only to less unhappiness To live in despair is a mark of great endurance whereas to grow dull and stupid after a great unhappiness is a mark of deficiency Selfcontrol and sustained inner effort are required in order to diminish unhappiness All efforts to attain happiness on the other hand are entirely futile You cannot retrace your steps once youve taken the path to unhappiness it is the path of no return From being happy one can become unhappy so there are more unpleasant surprises in happiness than in unhappiness The world seems right to us when we are happy when unhappy we wish the world were anything but what it is Though fully aware that the source of unhappiness is in us we nevertheless turn a personal defect into a metaphysical deficiency Unhappiness will never be sufficiently generous to acknowledge its own darkness in the world Substituting for our subjective plight an objective one we hope to lighten our burden and avoid the reproaches which we should in fact address to ourselves But such objectification actually deepens our unhappiness and presenting it as cosmic fatality shuts off any possibility of lessening it or of making it more bearable The discipline of unhappiness causes less anxiety and fewer painful surprises it abates agony and confines suffering It is a disguise for an inner drama the discreet mask of agony Beautys Magic Tricks Mans sensitivity to beauty grows as he gets closer to happiness In beauty all things find their justification their raison detre We conceive a beautiful thing such as it is A painting or a landscape delights us to such an extent that we can not imagine them in any other way but what they are To place the world under the sign of beauty is to assert that it is as it should be Then all is glorious harmony and even the negative aspects of existence do nothing but increase its glory and its charm Beauty will not bring us salvation but it will bring us closer to happiness In a world of antinomies can beauty be spared Its specific nature and attraction lie in the fact that it is paradoxical only from an objective point of view The esthetic expresses this paradox to represent the absolute through form to give infinity objective finite shape The absolute intheform that is embodied in limited expressions reveals itself only to him who is overcome by esthetic emotion from any other point of view it is a contradictio in adjecto For this reason there is an incalculable amount of illusion in any ideal of beauty But even worse is the fact that the fundamental premise of any ideal beauty that the world is the way it should be does not hold up under investigation The world could be any way except the way it is Man s Inconsistency Why do men insist on achieving something Would it not be better if they stood still under the sun in calm and silent immobility What is there to accomplish Why so much effort and ambition Man has forgotten the meaning of silence Although consciousness is the offspring of a vital deficiency it is not a cause for inadaptability in every individual in some it has on the contrary produced an exacerbation of their vital instincts Unable to live in the present man amasses things which weigh and subjugate him the feeling of the future is a calamity to him Consciousness has divided men into two categories equally unbalanced and unhappy those bent on interiorization selftorment and tragedy and those possessed by the imperialistic urger to acquire and to own Consciousness made animal man and man demon but it has never made anyone God no matter how proud the world is to have killed one on the cross Shun men impervious to vice for their insipidity is tiresome For what would their conversation be about if not morality Whoever has not ventured beyond morality has not fully explored lifes opportunities and has never transfigured his sins Genuine existence begins where morality ends only after that can it experiment with everything risk everything even if obstacles block the road to achievement Only through innumerable transfigurations can one reach the region where all is permitted where the soul can fling itself without remorse into vulgarity sublimity or grotesqueness to such an extent that no direction or form of life remains unexplored The tyranny governing ordinary existence vanishes and is replaced by the absolute spontaneity of unique existence which carries its own law in itself Could morality still serve such a being probably the most generous because also the most absurd capable of renouncing the whole world and consequently giving away all that can be given Generosity is incompatible with morality that rationalization of customs that mechanization of life Any generous act is absurd a renunciation unheard of in the ordinary man who drapes himself in morality in order to hide his vulgar nullity All that is truly moral begins when we have done with morality The pettiness of its laws is never more evident than in its condemnation of vice the expression of carnal tragedy born from the presence of the spirit in the flesh Vice is the tragedy of the flesh the flesh bursting out of its own fatality attempting to break the shackles imprisoning its passionate impulses An organic weariness drives the nerves and the flesh to a despair that only an exploration of all forms of pleasure can alleviate In vice the attraction of the abnormal creates a troubling anxiety the spirit seems to have become blood and stirs in the flesh like an immanent force Exploration of the possible cannot take place without the participation of the spirit Vice is the triumph of the individual how could flesh represent the individual without outside intervention The mingling of flesh and spirit blood and consciousness creates an extremely rich effervescence for the man ensnared by vice Nothing is worse than vice which is learned aped or borrowed thus a rational extenuation of vice is unjustified at best one must single out its fecundity for those who know how to transfigure it who can deviate its deviation To practice it in criminal and vulgar ways is to exploit its scandalous materiality and ignore the immaterial frisson which constitutes its excellence To attain certain heights intimacy cannot dispense with the anxieties of vice No man of vice can be condemned unless he ceases to look upon vice as a pretext and turns it into a goal Capitulation How does one become a pessimist An organic fatality rising from deep inner turmoil and without any external stimulus causes incessant depressions which stifle the elan attacking life at its roots It is wrong to surmise that a pessimist has an organic deficiency or weak vital instincts In fact none but those who love life passionately though maybe unconsciously become pessimists The devitalizing process takes place later as a consequence of depressions for only in passionate visionary men do depressions have such capacity for erosion that they devour life as waves swallow up the shore In the weak man depressions cause neither tension crises nor excess they lead to apathy and slow death The pessimist represents an organic paradox whose insurmountable contradictions generate an intense effervescence Is not this combination of frequent depressions with equally frequent elans a paradoxical situation It goes without saying that depressions weaken and exhaust vitality for depressions are assaults on life There is no efficient way to fight them they can subside temporarily through intense work and amusements Only one endowed with restless vitality is susceptible to pessimism You become a pessimist a demonic elemental bestial pessimist only when life has been defeated many times in its fight against depression Then destiny emerges in mans consciousness as a form of the irreparable Facing Silence Once you have come to set great store by silence you have hit upon a fundamental expression of life in the margins The reverence for silence of great solitaries and founders of religions has far deeper roots than we think Mens presence must have been unendurable and their complex problems disgusting for one not to care about anything except silence Chronic fatigue predisposes to a love of silence for in it words lose their meaning and strike the ear with the hollow sonority of mechanical hammers concepts weaken expressions lose their force the word grows barren as the wilderness The ebb and flow of the outside is like a distant monotonous murmur unable to stir interest or curiosity Then you will think it useless to express an opinion to take a stand to make an impression the noises you have renounced increase the anxiety of your soul After having struggled madly to solve all problems after having suffered on the heights of despair in the supreme hour of revelation you will find that the only answer the only reality is silence The Double and His Art One does not learn the art of psychology one lives and experiences it for no science will give you the key to the mysteries of the soul One cannot become a good psychologist without turning oneself into an object of study evincing daily interest in the complexity of ones own case To be initiated into the mysteries of the Other you must first be initiated into your own In order to be a psychologist you must be sufficiently unhappy to understand happiness so refined that you could become a barbarian at any moment and so intensely desperate that you do not know whether you live in a desert or in the midst of a fire Protean equally centripetal and centrifugal your ecstasy will have to be esthetic sexual religious and perverse Fine psychological understanding is the product of a life of selfcontemplation a life which sees itself in other lives as if in so many mirrors for a psychologist all men are fragments of himself The psychologists contempt for others contains a grain of secret and unlimited selfirony No one practices psychology out of love it is rather a form of sadism a desire to annihilate the other by taking possession of his intimate being by stripping him of his mysterious aura Quickly exhausting men and their limited resources the psychologist is easily bored for he is not naive enough to have friends and is too selfconscious to have lovers Skepticism is not the beginning but the natural end of psychology It is natures punishment for this violator of mysteries this supremely indiscreet person who having invested too few illusions in knowledge ends in disillusion A little knowledge is delightful a lot disgusting The more you know the less you want to know He who has not suffered from knowledge has never known anything Nonsense When the ticking of a watch breaks the silence of eternity arousing you out of serene contemplation how can you help resenting the absurdity of time its march into the future and all the nonsense about evolution and progress Why go forward why live in time The sudden revelation of time at such moments conferring upon it a crushing preeminence otherwise nonexistent is the fruit of a strong contempt for life an unwillingness to go on If this revelation happens at night the sensation of unutterable loneliness is added to the absurdity of time because then far from the crowd you face time alone the two of you caught in an irreducible duality Time in this nocturnal desolation is no longer populated with actions and objects it becomes an evergrowing nothingness a dilating void a threat from beyond Silence resounds then with the mournful clamor of bells knelling for a dead universe Only he who has separated time from existence lives this drama fleeing the latter he is crushed by the former And he feels how time like death gains ground E M Cioran A Short Chronology  E M Cioran is born April  in Rasinari near the city of Sibiu in Southern Transylvania then still part of the AustroHungarian empire His father is a Romanian Orthodox priest  He attends high school in Sibiu  He studies philosophy at the University of Bucharest where he writes a thesis on Henri Bergson  On the Heights of Despair his first book is published in Bucharest by the King Carol II Foundation for Art and Literature It is awarded the foundations prestigious prize for young authors  He earns his Teaching Certificate in philosophy Cartea amagirilor The Book of Delusions   Schimbarea lafa aaRomaniei Romania s Transfiguration  He wins a fellowship from the French Institute in Bucharest and leaves for Paris where he has lived ever since as a stateless person a status he calls most appropiate for an intellectual Lacrimi i Sfinp Tears and Saints  his last Romanian work appears in Bucharest after his departure  Living in Paris like a perennial student he applies for grants lives in cheap hotel rooms and eats in university cafeterias  He submits to the Gallimard publishing house the manuscript of his first French book Precis de decomposition It is accepted but he retrieves it and rewrites it entirely four times Writing in French was the most difficult task of my life something akin to putting on a straitjacket  Precis de decomposition is published  He lives modestly in Paris working part time as translator and manuscript reader and continues his writing He describes his life in the following words I dont make a living I eke one out I dont wish to be well off FOREWORD by Eugene Thacker The desire for utopia is arguably as urgent and as necessary as the desire for history They are the meaningmaking activities through which we as human beings project ourselves back into the past and forward into the future And yet both are fabrications products of human intellectual labor forged and reforged with all the solidity and assurance of fact That is until the drama is played out once again This is readily apparent for the person living in exile especially that of a selfimposed exile Removed from one context and transplanted into another human affairs become uncanny a familiar pantomime with different sets and different costumes Such was the outlook of E M Cioran the Romanianborn author who in  relocated to Paris vowing never to return to Romania Writing in a language not his own cut off from friends and family and immersed in a cosmopolitan culture he kept at arm s length the young Cioran began to develop a style of writing that was and still is difficult to place somewhere between philosophy and poetry the confession and the rant ecstatic nihilism and black humor Strange then that an author like Cioran would publish a book with the title History and Utopia By its title alone History and Utopia published in  announces itself as a book about politics a book of its moment But readers will be disappointed if they expect to find a plan for political action a manifesto for a coming revolution or even a commentary on current events The book s sentiments are encapsulated one of the essays entitled Odyssey of Rancor The multiplication of our kind borders on the obscene the duty to love them on the preposterous Composed of essays written during the late s History and Utopia contains a fascinating range of registers from the confessional opening chapter to the almost cosmic final chapter Coursing through it all is Cioran s own brand of political pessimism an indictment of utopia that itself becomes a strange kind of misanthropic utopia a utopia without hope in which politics always fails because it regards itself as an exclusively humancentric endeavor Viscerally inclined to systems we ceaselessly construct them especially in politics domain of pseudoproblems breeding ground of the bad philosopher who resides in each of us a realm I would be exiled from for the most commonplace of reasons a piece of evidence which is raised in my eyes to the rank of a revelation politics revolves uniquely around man Coming from Cioran such a zoomingout of what we normally consider politics should not surprise us From his early Romanian book On the Heights of Despair   to his first book written in French A Short History of Decay   to his critical dismantling of existentialism The Temptation to Exist   Cioran had by the s become known as a thinker who refused to be allied with any doctrine be it religious philosophical or political Notorious for its stark nihilistic indictments against humanity Cioran s writing is a sustained practice of refusal At the same time History and Utopia is unique among Cioran s books in that it does deal directly with the political issues of his time most presciently the turbulence in Eastern Europe particularly in Romania and the broader historical ramifications of an ongoing Cold War for a rapidly modernizing West We should note however that in spite of its explicit references to political events History and Utopia is not the sole political writing of Cioran In  a young impassioned and politicized Cioran published a book in Romanian entitled The Transfiguration of Romania Part of Romania s young generation of intellectuals Cioran was taken by the political extremism then sweeping through Bucharest A confused and delirious piece of writing The Transfiguration of Romania was Cioran s attempt to embrace a militant mysticism of the old world and the new a heady mix of nationalistic zeal and apocalyptic renewal Filled with romantic formulas for criminal lucidity and messianic fury the author s enthusiasm quickly led to disenchantment accompanied by an allencompassing resentment for all political systems moderate or extreme left or right By the end of the war Cioran had disavowed the book and ceased writing about current events altogether But it continued to haunt him for the rest of his life In interviews when asked about The Transfiguration of Romania Cioran is by turns remorseful disdainful bitter The estrangement from his own writing would prompt him to write the series of essays that would become History and Utopia There were external reasons as well The  insurrection in Budapest which Cioran witnessed from afar was intensified in his correspondence with his friend and former schoolmate the philosopher Constantin Noica held for years as a political prisoner by the Sovietbacked regime Their correspondence would be the basis for the opening chapter of History and Utopia Letter to a Faraway Friend The letter is indicative of the many conflicted voices that constitute History and Utopia Continuing his practice of writing against oneself Cioran s prose slips between the personal and the political unwilling to engage with the world but incapable of detaching himself from it I seem to myself among civilized men a kind of intruder a troglodyte enamored of decrepitude plunged into subversive prayers victim of a panic that emanates not from a vision of the world but from the spasms of the flesh and the tenebrae of the blood An Augustine without his faith a Kierkegaard without his leap Cioran proposes nothing and perhaps therein lies his politics Neither heroic nor tragic nor even comedic History and Utopia is the testimony of someone who has given up on politics because in part he has given up on the human or at least the image of humanity that incessantly feeds the political machinations of both history and utopia How could it be otherwise on a planet where flesh propagates with the shamelessness of a scourge Wherever we go we come up against the human a repulsive ubiquity before which we fall into stupor and revolt    All that remains is this void of refusal though it is in Cioran s own words a void that affords plentitude a fulfilling void Letter to a Faraway Friend From that country which was ours and now is no one s you urge me after so many years of silence to send you details about my occupations and about this wonderful world in which you say I am lucky enough to live and move and have my being I might answer that I am a man without occupation and that this world is not in the least wonderful But so laconic a reply cannot for all its exactitude assuage your curiosity or satisfy the many questions you raise There is one among them which scarcely to be distinguished from a reproach strikes me more than all the rest you ask if I ever intend to return to our own language or if I shall remain faithful to this other tongue in which you quite gratuitously attribute to me a facility I do not and never shall possess It would be the narrative of a nightmare were I to give you a detailed account of the history of my relations with this borrowed idiom with all these words so often weighed worked over refined subtle to the point of nonexistence bowed beneath the exactions of nuance inexpressive from having expressed everything alarming in their precision burdened with fatigue and modesty discreet even in vulgarity How should a Scyth come to terms with such terms grasp their true meaning and wield them with scruple with probity There is not one among them whose exhausted elegance fails to dizzy me no longer a trace of earth of blood of soul in such words A syntax of severe of cadaverous dignity encompasses them and assigns them a place from which God Himself could not dislodge them What consumption of coffee of cigarettes and of dictionaries merely to write one halfway decent sentence in this inapproachable language too noble and too distinguished for my taste I realized as much unfortunately only after the fact when it was too late to change my course otherwise I should never have abandoned our own whose odor of growth and corruption I occasionally regret that mixture of sun and dung with all its nostalgic ugliness its splendid squalor Return to it I cannot the tongue I was obliged to adopt pinions and subjugates me by the very pains it has cost me Am I a renegade as you insinuate A man s country is but a camp in the desert says a Tibetan text I do not go so far and would give all the landscapes of the world for that of my childhood Yet I must add that if I make it into a paradise the legerdemain or the infirmities of my memory are exclusively responsible Pursued by our origins we all are the emotion mine inspire necessarily translates itself into negative terms the language of selfpunishment of humiliation acknowledged and proclaimed of an accession to disaster Is such patriotism answerable to psychiatry Perhaps yet I cannot conceive of any other and considering our destinies it seems to me why hide it from you the only reasonable kind More fortunate than I you have resigned yourself to our natal dust you possess further the faculty of enduring any regime including the most rigid varieties Not that you lack a nostalgia for caprice and chaos but after all I know no mind more refractory than yours to the superstitions of democracy There was a time it is true when I resisted it as much as you do perhaps more than you do I was young and could not admit other truths than mine or concede to an adversary the right to possess to exercise to impose his own That sides parties could face yet not confound each other was beyond my comprehension Shame of the Race symbol of an anemic humanity without passions or convictions unfit for absolutes unworthy of a future limited at every point incapable of raising itself to the lofty wisdom which taught me that the object of an argument was the pulverization of the adversary so I regarded the parliamentary system Those regimes on the other hand that sought to eliminate and replace it seemed to me splendid without exception in harmony with the movement of Life my divinity in those days If a man has not by the time he is thirty yielded to the fascination of every form of extremism I don t know whether he is to be admired or scorned regarded as a saint or a corpse Lacking biological resources has he not located himself above or below time Positive or negative the deficiency is no more than that With neither the desire nor the will to destroy he is suspect he has triumphed over the demon or more serious still was never possessed by one To live in any true sense of the word is to reject others to accept them one must be able to renounce to do oneself violence to act against one s own nature to weaken oneself we conceive freedom only for ourselves we extend it to our neighbors only at the cost of exhausting efforts whence the precariousness of liberalism a defiance of our instincts a brief and miraculous success a state of exception at the antipodes of our deepest imperatives By our nature we are unsuited to it only the debilitation of our forces makes us accessible to it tragedy of a race which must debase itself on one hand to be ennobled on the other and of which no member unless by a precocious decrepitude sacrifices to humane principles Tolerance the function of an extinguished ardor of a disequilibrium resulting not from an excess but from a dearth of energy tolerance cannot seduce the young We do not involve ourselves in political struggles with impunity it is to the cult of which the young were the object that our age owes its bloodthirsty aspect the century s convulsions emanate from them from their readiness to espouse an aberration and to translate it into action Give them the hope or the occasion of a massacre they will follow you blindly At the end of adolescence a man is a fanatic by definition I have been one myself and to the limits of absurdity Do you remember that period when I poured out incendiary tirades less from a love of scandal than a longing to escape a fever which without the outlet of verbal dementia would certainly have consumed me Convinced that the evils of our society derived from old men I conceived a liquidation of every citizen over the age of forty that onset of sclerosis and mummification that turning point after which I chose to believe every individual becomes an insult to the nation and a burden to the collectivity So admirable did the project seem to me that I did not hesitate to divulge it those concerned were something less than appreciative of its tenor and labeled me a cannibal my career as a public benefactor began under discouraging auspices You yourself though so generous and in your way so enterprising by dint of reservations and objections had persuaded me to give it up Was my project so blameworthy It merely expressed what every man who loves his country hopes for in his inmost heart the suppression of half his compatriots When I think of those moments of enthusiasm and frenzy of the wild speculations that raddled and ravaged my mind I attribute them now not to dreams of philanthropy and destruction to the obsession with some unascertainable purity but to an animal melancholy which concealed beneath the mask of fervor functioned at my expense though I was its willing accomplice enchanted not to be obliged like so many others to choose between the insipid and the atrocious The atrocious falling to my portion what more could I ask I had a wolf s soul and my ferocity feeding on itself satiated flattered me I was in other words the happiest of lycanthropes Glory I aspired to and shunned in one and the same movement once achieved what is it worth I reminded myself from the moment it singles us out and imposes us only on the present and future generations excludes us from the past What is the use of being known if we have not been so to this sage or that madman to a Marcus Aurelius or to a Nero We shall never have existed for so many of our idols our name will have troubled none of the centuries before us and those that come after what do they matter What does the future that half of time matter to the man who is infatuated with eternity By what struggles I managed to rid myself of such madness I shall not tell you it would take too long requiring one of those endless conversations that is or was a Balkan secret Whatever my difficulties they were far from being the sole cause of the change in my orientation a more natural and more painful phenomenon greatly contributed to this age with its unmistakable symptoms I began to show more and more signs of tolerance symptoms it seemed to me of some inner upheaval some doubtless incurable disease Worst of all I no longer had the strength to desire my enemy s death quite the contrary I understood him compared his venom to my own he existed and nameless downfall I was glad he existed My hatreds the source of my exultations died down diminished from day to day and in departing carried off with them the best of myself What will I do Into what abyss will I creep I kept wondering And in proportion as my energy waned my penchant for tolerance waxed no doubt about it I was no longer young others seemed conceivable to me even real I said farewell to The Ego and Its Own discretion tempted me was I done for One must be in order to become a sincere democrat To my delight I realized that such was not exactly my case that I retained certain vestiges of fanaticism some traces of youth I compromised none of my new principles I was an intractable liberal I am still O happy incompatibility O saving absurdity I sometimes aspire to set an example as a perfect moderate I congratulate myself at the same time upon not succeeding so greatly do I fear my own dotage The moment will come when no longer fearing it I shall approach that ideal equilibrium I sometimes dream of and if my friend the years should lead you as I hope to a downfall like mine then perhaps toward the century s end we shall sit side by side in our resuscitated parliament and one as senile as the other may both bear witness to a perpetual and enchanting spectacle One becomes tolerant only insofar as one loses one s vigor as one collapses oh charmingly into childhood as one is too weary to torment others whether out of love or out of hatred As you see I take broad views So broad I have no idea where I stand on any problem at all You shall judge as much for yourself to the question you ask Do you still harbor your old prejudices against our little neighbor to the west do you still resent her as much I don t know what answer to give at best I can dumbfound or disappoint you Because of course we do not have the same experience of Hungary Born beyond the Carpathians you could not know the Hungarian policeman terror of my Transylvanian childhood When I so much as glimpsed one from afar I was panicstricken and ran away he was the alien the enemy to hate was to hate him Because of him I abhorred all Hungarians with a truly Magyar passion In other words they interested me Subsequently the circumstances having changed I no longer had any reason to hate them But the fact remains that long afterward I could not imagine an oppressor without evoking their defects their glories Who rebels who rises in arms Rarely the slave but almost always the oppressor turned slave The Hungarians know tyranny at close range having wielded it with an incomparable proficiency the minorities of the old monarchy could testify to that Because they were so gifted in their past in the role of masters they have been in our own day less disposed than any other nation of central Europe to endure slavery if they had a talent for fiat how could they fail to have one for freedom Strong in their tradition as persecutors accustomed to the mechanism of subjugation and intolerance they have risen against a regime that has its similarities to the one they themselves had reserved for other peoples But we dear friend not having had the occasion hitherto of being oppressors cannot now have that of being rebels Deprived of this double fortune we bear our chains dutifully and it would scarcely be gracious of me to deny the virtues of our discretion the nobility of our servitude while admitting nonetheless that the excesses of our modesty impel us to disturbing extremes so much discretion exceeds all limits it is so disproportionate that it sometimes manages to discourage me I envy then the arrogance of our neighbors I envy even their language savage as it may be but of a beauty that has nothing human about it with sonorities of another universe powerful and corrosive appropriate to prayer to groans and to tears risen out of hell to perpetuate its accent and its aura Though I know only its swear words Hungarian never fails to delight me I never tire of hearing it it enchants and repels me I succumb to its charm and to its horror to all those words of nectar and cyanide so suited to the exigencies of an agony It is in Hungarian that one should expire or renounce dying The fact is I hate my former masters less and less Upon reflection even in the days of their splendor they were always alone in the heart of Europe isolated in their pride and their regrets lacking any profound affinities with the other nations After several incursions into the West where they could exhibit and expend their first savagery they fell back conquerors degenerating into sedentaries to the banks of the Danube there to sing to lament to erode their instincts There is in these refined Huns a melancholy consisting of a suppressed cruelty whose equivalent is not to be found elsewhere it is as if the blood began dreaming about itself And at last resolved itself into melody Close to their essence though defiled and even branded by civilization conscious of descending from a unique horde stamped by a fatuousness both profound and theatrical which affords them a style more romantic than tragic how could they disappoint the mission that fell to their lot in the modern world to rehabilitate chauvinism by introducing into it enough pomp and fatality to make it picturesque to the eyes of the disabused observer I am all the more inclined to acknowledge their merits since it is they who have made me suffer the worst humiliation that of being born a serf as well as pangs of shame the most intolerable of all according to one moralist Have you yourself not experienced the voluptuous pleasure to be taken in an effort of objectivity toward those who have flouted scorned mistreated you especially when you secretly share their vices and their miseries Do not from this infer that I long to be promoted to the rank of Magyar I am far from any such presumption I know my limits and intend to abide by them On the other hand I also know those of our neighbor and should my enthusiasm for her drop even one degree it would suffice to disengage my vanity from the honor Hungary did me by persecuting me Peoples much more than individuals inspire contradictory sentiments we love and loathe them at the same time objects of attachment and of aversion they do not deserve our harboring in their behalf a specific passion Your partiality to those of the West whose defects you do not clearly distinguish is the effect of distance an error of optics or a nostalgia for the inaccessible Nor do you distinguish any better the lacunae of bourgeois society I even suspect you of a certain leniency in its regard That from such a distance you should have a wonderworking view of it is natural enough since I know it at close range it is my duty to combat the illusions you may entertain Not that such a society is entirely and absolutely displeasing to me you know my weakness for the horrible but the expenditure of insensitivity it requires in order to be endured is out of all proportion to my reserves of cynicism It is an understatement to say that in this society injustices abound in truth it is itself the quintessence of injustice Only the idle the parasite the expert in turpitude the great swindler and the petty crook profit by the benefits it bestows the opulence on which it prides itself surface pleasures and surface profusions Under the shellac it shows off lies a world of desolation whose details I shall spare you Without the intervention of a miracle how explain that it does not reduce itself to dust before our eyes or that someone does not blow it up instantaneously Ours is worth no more quite the contrary you will object I agree But there s the rub We find ourselves dealing with two types of society both intolerable And the worst of it is that the abuses in yours permit this one to persevere in its own to offer its own horrors as a counterpoise to those cultivated chez vous The capital reproach one can address to your regime is that it has ruined Utopia a principle of renewal in both institutions and peoples The bourgeoisie has understood the advantage to be derived from this failure against the adversaries of the status quo the miracle which saves which preserves it from an immediate destruction is precisely the debacle of the other side the spectacle of a great idea disfigured the resulting disappointment which laying hold of men s minds paralyzes them A really unhopedfor disappointment a providential support for the bourgeois who lives on it and from it extracts the reason for his security The masses are not stirred if they have no more than a choice between present evils and evils to come resigned to those they suffer now they have no interest in risking themselves in the direction of others which are unknown but certain Foreseeable miseries do not excite men s imaginations and there is no example of a revolution breaking out in the name of a dark future a grim prophecy Who could have guessed in the last century that the new society would by its vices and its iniquities permit the old one to preserve even to consolidate itself that the possible having become reality would fly to the rescue of the past On either side we are at a nodal point both fallen from that naivete in which speculations on the future are elaborated In the long run life without utopia is suffocating for the multitude at least threatened otherwise with petrifaction the world must have a new madness This is the one piece of evidence to be gained from an analysis of the present Meanwhile our situation on this side is certainly a curious one Imagine a society overpopulated with doubts in which with the exception of a few strays no one adheres utterly to anything in which unscathed by superstitions and certainties everyone pays lip service to freedom and no one respects the form of government that defends and incarnates it Ideals without content or to use a word quite as adulterated myths without substance You are disappointed after promises that could not be kept we by a lack of any promises at all At least we are aware of the advantage the intelligence gains from a regime that for the moment lets it function as it will without submitting it to the rigors of any imperative The bourgeois believes in nothing true enough but this truth is I daresay the positive side of his vacuum for freedom can be manifested only in the void of beliefs in the absence of axioms and only where the laws have no more authority than a hypothesis If you were to object that the bourgeois nonetheless believes in something that money perfectly fulfills for him the function of a dogma I should reply that this worst of all dogmas is strange as it may seem the one that is the most endurable for the mind We forgive others their wealth if in exchange they let us starve to death in our own way No it is not so sinister this society which pays no attention to you which abandons you guarantees you the right to attack it invites you even obliges you to do so in its hours of sloth when it lacks energy to execrate itself As indifferent in the last instance to its own fate as to yours it is in no way eager to infringe upon your misfortunes neither to reduce nor to aggravate them and if it exploits you it does so by an automatism without premeditation or spite as is appropriate to weary and satiated brutes that are as contaminated by skepticism as their victims The difference between regimes is less important than it appears you are alone by force we without constraint Is the gap so wide between an inferno and a ravaging paradise All societies are bad but there are degrees I admit and if I have chosen this one it is because I can distinguish among the nuances of trumpery Freedom I was saying demands in order to manifest itself a vacuum it requires a void and succumbs to it The condition that determines it is the very one that annihilates it It lacks foundations the more complete it is the more it overhangs an abyss for everything threatens it down to the principle from which it derives Man is so little made to endure or deserve it that the very benefits he receives from it crush him and freedom ultimately burdens him to the point where he prefers to its excesses those of terror To these disadvantages are added others a liberal society eliminating mystery the absolute order and possessing a true metaphysic no more than a true police casts the individual back upon himself while dividing him from what he is from his own depths If such a society lacks roots if it is essentially superficial this is because freedom fragile in itself has no means of maintaining itself of surviving the dangers which threaten it from without and from within it appears moreover only in the twilight of a regime only at the moment when a class is declining dissolving it was the collapse of the aristocracy that allowed the eighteenth century to divagate so magnificently it is the collapse of the bourgeoisie that allows us today to cultivate our fantasies Freedoms prosper only in a sick body politic tolerance and impotence are synonyms This is patent in politics as everywhere else When I first glimpsed this truth the earth gave way under my feet Even now though I tell myself You belong to a society of free men the pride I take in the fact is still accompanied by a sense of dread and inanity the result of my terrible certitude In the course of history freedom occupies no more instants than ecstasy in the life of a mystic It escapes us at the very moment we try to grasp and formulate it no one can enjoy freedom without trembling Desperately mortal once it is established it postulates its lack of a future and labors on with all its undermined forces to its own negation its own agony Is there not a certain perversion in our love for it And is it not horrifying to worship what neither can nor cares to last For you who no longer possess it freedom is everything for us who do it is merely an illusion because we know that we shall lose it and that in any case it is made to be lost Hence at the heart of our void we cast our glances in all directions without thereby neglecting the possibilities of salvation that reside in ourselves There is moreover no such thing as a perfect vacuum in history That unheardof absence to which we are reduced and which I have the pleasure and the misfortune to reveal to you you would be mistaken to imagine merely a blank uninscribed for in it I discern presentiment or hallucination a kind of expectation of other gods Which ones No one can say All I know and it is what everyone knows is that a situation like ours cannot be endured indefinitely Deep within our consciousness one hope crucifies us one apprehension exalts us Unless they assent to death the old nations however rotten cannot dispense with new idols Whether or not the West is irremediably corrupt it must rethink all the ideas stolen from it and applied by counterfeiting them elsewhere I mean that it is incumbent upon the West if it seeks to make itself illustrious once more by a throb or a vestige of honor to take back the utopias that in its need for comfort it has abandoned to the others thereby dispossessing itself of its genius and its mission Whereas it was the West s duty to put communism into practice to adjust it to its traditions to humanize liberalize and thereafter propose it to the world it has left to the East the privilege of realizing the unrealizable of deriving power and prestige from the finest of our modern illusions In the battle of ideologies the West has shown itself timid harmless some congratulate it for this whereas it is to be blamed in our day and age one does not accede to hegemony without the cooperation of those lofty lying principles employed by virile peoples to dissimulate their instincts and their aims Having abandoned reality for ideas and ideas for ideology man has slid toward a derived universe toward a world of subproducts in which fiction acquires the virtues of a primordial datum This process is the fruit of all the rebellions and all the heresies of the West yet the West refuses to draw the final consequences it has not initiated the revolution that was its imperative the revolution that its entire past demanded nor has it carried to their conclusion the upheavals of which it was the instigator By disinheriting itself in favor of its enemies the West risks compromising its denouement and missing a supreme opportunity Not content with having betrayed all those precursors all those schismatics who have prepared and formed it from Luther to Marx it still supposes that someone will come from the outside to initiate its revolution to bring back its utopias and its dreams Will the West ever understand that it has a political destiny and a role only if it rediscovers in itself its old dreams and its old utopias as well as the lies of its old pride For the moment it is the adversaries of the West who converted into theoreticians of the duty it evades are building their empires on its timidity its lassitude What curse has fallen upon it that at the term of its trajectory it produces only these businessmen these shopkeepers these racketeers with their blank stares and atrophied smiles to be met with everywhere in Italy as in France in England as in Germany Is it with such vermin as this that a civilization so delicate and so complex must come to an end Perhaps we had to endure this out of abjection in order to be able to conceive of another kind of man As a good liberal I do not want to carry indignation to the point of intolerance or to let myself be carried away by my moods though it is sweet for us all to be able to infringe upon the principles that appeal to our generosity I merely wanted to point out to you that our world far from wonderful could in a sense become so if it consented not to annihilate itself as it inclines all too readily to do  but to liquidate its failures by undertaking impossible tasks opposed to that dreadful good sense which is disfiguring and destroying it today The feelings the West inspires in me are no less mixed than those I entertain toward my country toward Hungary or toward our big neighbor whose indiscreet proximity you are in a better position to appreciate than I The excessive good and bad I think of Russia the impressions she suggests when I reflect upon her destiny how can I put such things without falling into the preposterous I make no claim to change your opinion about her I merely want you to know what she represents for me and what place she occupies among my obsessions The more I think about her the more I find that Russia has formed herself down through the ages not the way a nation is formed but the way a universe is formed the moments of her evolution participating less in history than in a somber terrifying cosmogony Those tsars with their look of driedup divinities giants solicited by sanctity and crime collapsing into prayer and panic they were as are these recent tyrants who have replaced them closer to a geological vitality than to human anemia despots perpetuating in our time the primordial sap the primordial spoilage and triumphing over us all by their inexhaustible reserves of chaos Crowned or not it was their significance as it is still to leap beyond civilization to engulf it if need be the operation was inscribed within their nature since they have always suffered from the same obsession to extend their supremacy over our dreams and our rebellions to constitute an empire as vast as our disappointments or our dreads Such a nation coterminous both in its thoughts and in its actions with the confines of the globe does not measure itself by present standards or explain itself in ordinary terms in an intelligible language it would require the jargon of the Gnostics enriched by that of a general paralysis Certainly it borders has not Rilke assured us on God as it also does unfortunately on our own country and will again in a more or less immediate future on many others I dare not say on all despite the specific warnings that a malignant prescience intimates Wherever we are Russia already touches us if not geographically then without a doubt internally I am more disposed than any man I know to acknowledge my debts to her without her writers would I ever have grown aware of my wounds and of my duty to surrender to them Without her and without them would I not have wasted my agonies missed out on my chaos This penchant which leads me to make an impartial judgment upon her and at the same time to testify to my gratitude is hardly I fear to your taste at the present time I therefore break off such unseasonable eulogies stuffing them inside myself where they will be condemned to be fruitful and multiply Even in the days when we amused ourselves by tallying our agreements and our differences you reproached me for my mania of judging without bias both what I take to heart and what I execrate of entertaining only double necessarily false feelings which you imputed to my incapacity to experience a true passion while insisting on the delights I derive from them Your diagnosis was not inexact yet you erred with regard to the category of the delights Do you suppose it is so agreeable to be both idolater and victim of the pro and the con an enthusiast divided against his enthusiasms a raving madman eager for objectivity This does not happen without sufferings the instincts protest and it is indeed despite and against them that one advances toward an absolute irresolution a state scarcely distinct from what the language of the ecstatics calls the last point of annihilation In order to know myself the whole of my thoughts about anything at all in order to pronounce not only on a problem but on a trifle I must oppose the major vice of my mind that propensity to espouse all causes and at the same time dissociate myself from them a kind of omnipresent virus divided between covetousness and satiety a benign yet deadly agent as impatient as it is blase undecided between scourges inept at adopting and specializing in one shifting from each to the other without discrimination or effectiveness bearer and bungler of the incurable a traitor to all diseases those of others as to its own Never to have occasion to take a position to make up one s mind or to define oneself there is no wish I make more often But we do not always master our moods those attitudes in the bud those rough drafts of theory Viscerally inclined to systems we ceaselessly construct them especially in politics domain of pseudoproblems breeding grounds of the bad philosopher who resides in each of us a realm I would be exiled from for the most commonplace of reasons a piece of evidence which is raised in my eyes to the rank of a revelation politics revolves uniquely around man Having lost the taste for beings I nonetheless wear myself out in vain acquiring one for things necessarily limited to the interval that separates them I expend and exhaust myself upon their shadow Shadows too these nations whose fate intrigues me less for themselves than for the pretext they afford of revenging myself upon what has neither form nor outline upon entities and symbols The idler who loves violence safeguards his savoir vivre by confining himself in an abstract hell Abandoning the individual he frees himself of names and faces deals with the imprecise the general and orienting his thirst for exterminations to the impalpable conceives a new genre the pamphlet without object Clinging to fractions of ideas and to figments of dreams having arrived at reflection by accident or by hysteria and not at all by a concern for rigor I seem to myself among civilized men a kind of intruder a troglodyte enamored of decrepitude plunged into subversive prayers victim of a panic that emanates not from a vision of the world but from the spasms of the flesh and the tenebrae of the blood Impermeable to the solicitations of clarity and to the Latin contamination I feel Asia stirring in my veins am I the offspring of some inadmissible tribe or the spokesman of a race once turbulent today mute Often the temptation seizes me to forge for myself another genealogy to change ancestors to choose among those who in their day spread grief among the nations contrary to my own to our modest and martyred land stuffed with miseries amalgamated to the mud and groaning beneath the anathema of the ages Yes in my crises of fatuity I incline to believe myself the epigone of some horde illustrious for its depredations a Turanian at heart legitimate heir of the steppes the last Mongol    I would not end here without once again warning you against the enthusiasm or the jealousy my luck inspires in you specifically the opportunity to loll in a city whose memory doubtless haunts you despite your roots in our evaporated country This city which I would exchange for no other in the world is for that very reason the source of my misfortunes All that is not Paris being equal in my eyes I often regret that wars have spared it that it has not perished like so many others Destroyed it would have rid me of the happiness of living here I could have spent my days elsewhere at the ends of the earth I shall never forgive Paris for having bound me to space for making me from somewhere Mind you I am not forgetting for a moment that fourfifths of its inhabitants as Chamfort has already noted die of grief I should add further for your edification that the remaining fifth the privileged few of whom I am one are no different in their feelings and that they even envy that majority its advantage of knowing of what to die Russia and the Virus of Liberty Every country I sometimes think should be like Switzerland should complacently subside into hygiene insipidity the worship of laws and the cult of humanity at other times I admire only nations untouched by scruple in thought or deed feverish and insatiable ever ready to devour others and themselves riding roughshod over all values opposed to their ascent and their success scornful of prudence that plague of superannuated peoples weary of themselves as of all the rest and apparently captivated by the smell of mold In the same way if I abominate tyrants I nonetheless see that they constitute the warp of history and that without them the idea or the course of an empire would be inconceivable Superlatively odious of an inspired bestiality they suggest man driven to his limits the ultimate exasperation of his turpitudes and his virtues Ivan the Terrible to cite only the most fascinating among them exhausts every nook and cranny of psychology as complex in his madness as in his politics having made his reign and to a certain degree his country into a model nightmare prototype of a perennial hallucination a mixture of Mongolia and Byzantium combining the qualities and the defects of a khan and a basileus a monster of demoniac rages and sordid dejection torn between bloodthirstiness and remorse his joviality enriched with taunts and crowned with sneers he had a passion for crime as have we all insofar as we exist transgressions against others or ourselves Only in us it remains unslaked that passion so that our works whatever they may be derive from our incapacity to kill or to kill ourselves We do not always acknowledge as much we are glad to ignore the cozy mechanism of our infirmities If I am obsessed by the tsars or the Roman emperors it is because such infirmities concealed in us show quite plainly in them They reveal us to ourselves they incarnate and illustrate our secrets I think especially of those who doomed to an awesome degeneration turned on their own and fearing to be loved by them sent them to their doom They were powerful yet they were wretched unsatiated by the terror of others Are they not a sort of projection of the evil genius that dwells in us all and tempts us to believe we must leave nothing standing around us It is with such thoughts and such instincts that an empire is formed in it cooperates that subsoil of our consciousness in which are hidden our dearest faults Emerging from unsoundable depths possessed of an original vitality the ambition to rule the world appears only in certain individuals and at certain periods without direct relation to the quality of the nation in which it is manifested the difference between Napoleon and Genghis Khan is less than between the former and any French politician of the subsequent republics But these depths like this impulse can be exhausted can run dry Charlemagne Frederick II von Hohenstaufen Charles V Bonaparte Hitler were tempted each in his own way to realize the idea of universal empire they failed to do so more or less fortunately The West where this idea no longer inspires anything but irony or uneasiness now lives in shame of its conquests but oddly enough it is precisely when the West retreats that its formulas triumph and spread turned against Western power and Western supremacy they find an echo outside Western frontiers The West wins by losing This was how Greece prevailed in the realm of the mind once she had ceased being a power and even a nation her philosophy and her arts were pilfered her productions won a certain victory without her talents being assimilable in the same way the West is will be stripped of everything except its genius A civilization proves its fecundity by its talent to incite others to imitate it when it no longer dazzles them it is reduced to an epitome of vestiges and shards Abandoning this corner of the world the notion of empire would find a providential climate in Russia where it has always existed moreover singularly on the spiritual level After the fall of Byzantium Moscow became for the Orthodox consciousness the third Rome heir of the true Christianity the true faith First messianic awakening The second had to wait until our own day and age but that awakening is due this time to the resignation of the West In the fifteenth century Russia profited by a religious void as she profits today by a political one Two major opportunities to absorb her historical responsibilities When Mahomet II lay siege to Constantinople Christendom divided as always and delighted moreover to have lost all memory of the Crusades declined to intervene At first the besieged city expressed a certain irritation which as the disaster came into focus turned to stupor Oscillating between panic and a secret satisfaction the pope promised aid which came too late what was the use of taking so much trouble for schismatics  The schism however was to gain strength elsewhere Did Rome prefer Moscow to Byzantium A distant enemy is always preferable to the one at the gate In the same way in our own times the British would opt for a Russian preponderance in Europe over a German one Germany was too close Russia s claims to turn from vague primacy to distinct hegemony are not unfounded What would have become of the West if she had not halted and absorbed the Mongol invasion For over two centuries of humiliation and servitude Russia was excluded from history while the Western nations indulged themselves in the luxury of tearing each other to pieces Had Russia been in a condition to develop unhampered she would have become a firstrate power on the eve of modern times what she is now she would have been in the sixteenth or seventeenth century And the West Perhaps today the West would be Orthodox and Rome would enthrone not the Holy See but the Holy Synod But the Russians can still catch up If they manage as there is every reason to expect to execute their plans it is not out of the question that they will arrange matters with the sovereign pontiff Whether in the name of Marxism or of Orthodoxy they are fated to foil the Church s authority and prestige they cannot tolerate its aims without abdicating the essential point of their mission and their program Under the tsars identifying the Church with an instrument of Antichrist they offered prayers against it now holding it to be a Satanic tool of Reaction they overwhelm it with invectives rather more effective than their old anathemas soon they will overcome it with all their weight and all their power And it is not at all impossible that our age may count among its curiosities and in the form of a frivolous apocalypse the disappearance of St Peter s last successor By sanctifying History in order to discredit God Marxism has merely rendered Him more peculiar and more haunting You can stifle every impulse in humanity except the need for an Absolute which will survive the destruction of temples and even the disappearance of religion on earth The core of the Russian people being religious they will inevitably gain the upper hand Reasons of a historical order will have a good deal to do with this triumph By adopting Orthodoxy Russia manifested her desire to stand apart from the West it was her way of defining herself from the start Never outside certain aristocratic circles did she let herself be seduced by the Catholic as it happened Jesuit missionaries A schism does not express the divergencies of doctrine so much as a will to ethnic affirmation what appears in it is less an abstract controversy than a national reflex It was not the absurd question of the filioque that divided the churches Byzantium wanted its total autonomy Moscow a fortiori Schisms and heresies are nationalisms in disguise But whereas the Reformation merely assumed the appearance of a family quarrel of a scandal within the West Orthodox particularism acquiring a more profound character was to mark a division from the Western world itself By rejecting Catholicism Russia delayed her evolution lost a crucial opportunity for civilizing herself rapidly while gaining in substance and in unity her stagnation rendered her different made her other this is what she aspired to doubtless foreseeing that the West would one day regret its head start The stronger Russia became the more aware she grew of her roots from which in some sense Marxism will have alienated her after a forced cure of universalism she will reRussify in favor of Orthodoxy And moreover she will have stamped Marxism with a distinctly Slavic character Marxism enSlaved    Any nation of a certain scope that adopts an ideology alien to its traditions will adapt and denature it inflect it in the direction of its own national destiny distort it to its own advantage ultimately rendering it indistinguishable from its own genius A people possesses a necessarily distorting optic all its own a defect of vision which far from disconcerting it flatters and stimulates    The truths it avails itself of whatever they may lack in objective value are nonetheless vital and produce as such the kinds of errors that constitute the diversity of the historical landscape granted that the historian skeptical by metier temperament and option is stationed from the start outside of Truth While the Western nations exhausted themselves in their struggle for freedom and still more in that freedom once acquired nothing is so wearing as the possession or the abuse of liberty  the Russian people was suffering without selfexpenditure for one expends oneself only in history and since the Russians were excluded from history they were obliged to submit to the infallible systems of despotism inflicted upon them an obscure vegetative existence which allowed them to gain strength to accumulate energy to amass reserves and to draw from their servitude the maximum of biological advantage In this Orthodoxy was a great help but a popular Orthodoxy admirably articulated to keep that people apart from the course of events and opposed to the official Orthodoxy which oriented the government toward imperialist aims The double face of the Orthodox Church on the one hand it militated in favor of the somnolence of the masses on the other as an auxiliary of the tsars it wakened popular ambitions and made possible enormous conquests in the name of a passive population Fortunate passivity which assured the Russians their present predominance fruit of their historical belatedness Whether favorable or hostile to them all of Europe s enterprises hinge on them once she puts them at the heart of her interests and her anxieties she acknowledges that they have the potential to dominate her Thus is virtually realized one of the Russians oldest dreams That they have attained it under the auspices of an ideology of foreign provenance adds the spice of a further paradox to their success What matters finally is that the regime be Russian and entirely in the traditions of the country Is it not revealing that the Revolution a direct product of Occidentalist theories was increasingly oriented toward Slavophile ideas Moreover a people represents not so much an aggregate of ideas and theories as of obsessions those of Russians whatever their political complexion are always if not identical at least related A Tchaadaev who found no virtue in his country or a Gogol who mocked it pitilessly was just as attached to it as a Dostoevsky The most extreme of the Nihilists Netchaiev was quite as obsessed by it as Pobiedonostsev procurator of the Holy Synod and a reactionary through and through Only this obsession counts The rest is merely attitude For Russia to adapt to a liberal regime she would have to weaken considerably her vigor would have to decline better still she would have to lose her specific character and denationalize in depth How would she manage this with her unbroached internal resources and her thousand years of autocracy Even if she were to achieve such a thing in one bound she would instantly disintegrate Even more than a nation an empire if it is to survive and to flourish requires a certain dose of terror France herself could invest in democracy only when her springs were beginning to loosen only when no longer seeking hegemony she was preparing to become prudent and respectable Her First Empire was her final folly Thereupon accessible to liberty she would become painfully accustomed to it through a number of convulsions unlike England which a bewildering example had free relations of long standing without shocks or dangers thanks to the conformism and the enlightened stupidity of her citizens the country has not produced to my knowledge a single anarchist  In the long run time favors the fettered nations which amassing forces and illusions live in the future in hope but what can be hoped for in freedom or in the regime which incarnates it constituted of dissipation serenity and spinelessness A marvel that has nothing to offer democracy is at once a nation s paradise and its tomb Life has meaning only in democracy yet she lacks life    Immediate happiness imminent disaster inconsistency of a regime to which one does not adhere without falling on the horns of an agonizing dilemma Better furnished more fortunate Russia need not face such problems absolute power being for her as Karamzin already remarked the very basis of her being Ever aspiring to freedom without ever attaining it is this not her great superiority over the West which alas has long since attained to it Russia moreover is not ashamed of her empire quite the contrary she dreams only of extending it Who more than Russia has hastened to profit by the acquisitions of other peoples The achievements of Peter the Great even those of the Revolution participate in an inspired parasitism And it is true that she endured even the horrors of the Tartar yoke with a certain ingenuity If while confined in a calculated isolation Russia has managed to imitate the West she has managed even better to be admired by that West and to seduce some of its best minds The Encyclopedists were infatuated by the schemes of Peter and Catherine just as the heirs of the Enlightenment I mean the Left were to be infatuated with those of Lenin and Stalin This phenomenon argues in favor of Russia but not of the Westerners who complicated and ravaged to the last degree and seeking progress elsewhere outside themselves and their creations today find themselves paradoxically closer to Dostoevsky s characters than do the Russians themselves Yet we might observe that they evoke only the defeated aspects of these same characters that they possess neither their ferocious obsessions nor their virile sulks so many possessed men weakened by ratiocination and scruples eroded by subtle remorse by a thousand interrogations martyrs of doubt dazzled and annihilated by their own perplexities    Each civilization believes that its way of life is the only right one and the only one conceivable that it must convert the world to it or inflict it upon the world its way of life is equivalent to an explicit or camouflaged soteriology indeed to an elegant imperialism but one that ceases to be so as soon as it is accompanied by military enterprise You do not found an empire by whim You subjugate others so they will imitate you so they will model themselves on you on your beliefs and your habits then comes the perverse imperative to make slaves out of them in order to contemplate therein the flattering or caricatural sketch of yourself I grant that there is such a thing as a qualitative hierarchy of empires the Mongols and the Romans did not subjugate peoples for the same reasons and their conquests did not have the same result It is nonetheless true that they were equally expert in doing away with their adversary by reducing him to their own image Whether she has provoked or suffered then Russia has never been content with mediocre misfortunes The same will be true of her future she will fall upon Europe by a physical fatality by the automatism of her mass by her superabundant and morbid vitality so propitious to the generation of an empire in which a nation s megalomania is always materialized  by that health of hers crammed with the unforeseen with horrors and enigmas allocated to the service of a messianic idea rudiment and prefiguration of all conquests When the Slavophiles asserted that Russia must save the world they were employing a euphemism one hardly saves a world without ruling it As for a nation it finds its lifeprinciple in itself or nowhere how would it be saved by another Russia still thinks secularizing the Slavophiles language and their conception that it is her task to ensure the world s safety the West s first of all toward which moreover she has never experienced a clearcut feeling only attraction and repulsion and jealousy that jumble of secret worship and ostensible aversion inspired by the spectacle of a corruption as enviable as it is dangerous contact with which is to be sought but still more to be shunned Reluctant to define himself and to accept limits cultivating ambiguity in politics in morals and more seriously in geography with none of the naivetes inherent in civilized men rendered opaque to reality by the excesses of a rationalist tradition the Russian subtle by intuition as much as by the ageold experience of dissimulation is perhaps a child historically but in no case psychologically whence his complexity as a man of young instincts and old secrets whence too the contradictions exacerbated to grotesquerie of his attitudes When he decides to be profound and he succeeds quite effortlessly  he disfigures the slightest fact the merest idea It is as if he has the mania of a monumental grimace Everything is dizzying dreadful and ineffable in the history of his ideas revolutionary or otherwise He is still an incorrigible amateur of utopias now utopia is the grotesque en rose the need to associate happiness that is the improbable with becoming and to coerce an optimistic aerial vision to the point where it rejoins its own source the very cynicism it sought to combat In short a monstrous fantasy That Russia is in a position to realize her dream of a universal empire is a likelihood but not a certitude on the other hand it is patent that Russia can conquer and annex all Europe and even that she will proceed to do so if only to reassure the rest of the world    She is content with so little Where to find a more convincing proof of modesty of moderation The tip of a continent Meanwhile she contemplates it with the same eye with which the Mongols regarded China and the Turks Byzantium with this difference though that she has already assimilated a good many Western values whereas the Tartar and Ottoman hordes had only a wholly material superiority over their future prey It is doubtless regrettable that Russia has not passed through the Renaissance all her inequalities derive from that But with her gift for making up time she will be in a century perhaps in less as refined as vulnerable as that postRenaissance West at a level of civilization that can be outdone only by descending History s supreme ambition is to record the variations of this level Russia s inferior to that of Europe can only rise and Russia with it which is as much as to say that she is doomed to ascent By rising however does she not risk unbridled as she is losing her equilibrium bursting into ruins With her millions of souls kneaded by sects and by steppes she gives a singular impression of space and of claustration of immensity and of suffocation of the North in short but of a special North one irreducible to our analyses a North marked by a sleep and a hope that make us tremble by a night rich in explosions by a dawn we shall remember No Mediterranean transparency and gratuitousness in these Hyperboreans whose past like their present seems to belong to a different duration from ours Facing the West s fragility and renown they experience an embarrassment the consequence of their belated awakening and of their unemployed vigor this is the inferiority complex of the strong    They will escape it they will overcome it The sole point of light in our future is their nostalgia so secret and so intense for a delicate world of deliquescent charms If they accede to it as appears to be the obvious direction of their fate they will be civilized at the expense of their instincts and delightful prospect they too will be infected with the virus of liberty The more humane an empire becomes the more readily there develop within it the contradictions by which it will perish Of composite demeanor of heterogeneous structure the converse of a nation that organic reality  an empire requires to subsist the cohesive principle of terror If it lays itself open to tolerance that virtue will destroy its unity and its power and will act upon it in the manner of a deadly poison it has administered to itself This is because tolerance is not only the pseudonym of freedom but also of mind and mind even more deadly to empires than to individuals erodes them compromises their solidity and accelerates their collapse Hence it is the very instrument an ironic providence employs to destroy them If despite the arbitrariness of the attempt we were to divert ourselves by establishing zones of vitality in Europe we should discover that the farther east we move the more evident instinct becomes and the less noticeable as we head west The Russians are far from possessing an exclusive claim to it though even the other nations that possess instinct belong in varying degrees to the Soviet sphere of influence These nations have not spoken their last word far from it some of them like Poland or Hungary have played a not negligible part in history others like Yugoslavia Bulgaria and Rumania having lived in the shadows have endured only shortlived convulsions But whatever their past has been and independently of their level of civilization they all still possess a biological capital it would be futile to seek in the West Mistreated disinherited cast into an anonymous martyrdom pinioned between sloth and sedition they may yet know a coming compensation for so many ordeals so many humiliations and even so many cowardices The degree of instinct is not measured from outside to determine its intensity we must have frequented or divined these countries the only ones in the world still to espouse in their splendid blindness the destinies of the West Imagine our continent incorporated into the Russian empire then imagine that empire too vast weakening and falling apart and as a corollary imagine the emancipation of its peoples which among them will gain supremacy and supply Europe with that surfeit of impatience and power without which an irremediable stupor awaits her I cannot doubt the answer it is those I have just mentioned Given the reputation they enjoy my assertion will seem ludicrous Central Europe just possibly    But the Balkans I don t want to defend them nor do I want to pass over their virtues in silence That taste for devastation for internal clutter for a universe like a brothel on fire that sardonic outlook on ancient or imminent cataclysms that pungency that far niente of the insomniac or the assassin is it nothing then an inheritance so rich and so burdensome one that will thus empower those who come into it And who stamped with a soul will thereby prove that they preserve a residue of savagery Insolent and despairing they will choose to wallow in glory the appetite for which is inseparable from the will to selfassertion and collapse from the penchant for a fast twilight If their words are virulent their accents inhuman and occasionally ignoble this is because a thousand reasons impel them to howl louder than civilized men who have exhausted their cries The last primitives in Europe they may give her a new energy which she will not fail to regard as her last humiliation And yet if the Balkans were no more than horror why is it when we leave them and make for this part of the world why is it we feel a kind of fall an admirable one it is true into the abyss Life in depth the secret existence of peoples who enjoying the enormous advantage of having so far been rejected by history could capitalize their dreams that buried existence doomed to the miseries of a resurrection begins on the other side of Vienna a geographical extremity of Western decadence Austria whose erosion borders on the symbolic or the comical prefigures Germany s fate No sizable extravagance is left to the Germans no further mission of frenzy nothing to make them alluring or odious Predestined barbarians they destroyed the Roman Empire so that Europe could be born having created it they were appointed to destroy it vacillating with them Europe undergoes the recoil of their exhaustion Whatever dynamism they still possess they no longer have what underlies all energy or what justifies it Doomed to insignificance budding Helvetians forever banished from their habitual excess reduced to brooding over their degraded virtues and their diminished vices with as their sole hope the resource of being a mediocre tribe the Germans are unworthy of the fear they still inspire to believe in them or to be in dread of them is to do them an honor they scarcely deserve Their failure was Russia s providence Had they succeeded she would have been sidetracked for at least a century from her great aims But they could not succeed for they attained to the peak of their material power at the very moment when they had nothing more to offer when they were strong and empty The hour had already struck for others Are not the Slavs the ancient Germans with regard to the world which is disappearing asked Herzen in the middle of the last century Herzen the most perspicacious and lacerated of the Russian liberals a mind of prophetic interrogations disgusted by his own country disappointed by the West as unlikely to settle in a patrie as in a problem though he loved to speculate on the life of peoples a vague and inexhaustible subject an emigre s pastime Yet peoples according to another Russian Soloviev are not what they imagine themselves to be but what God thinks of them in His eternity I have no information as to God s opinion of the Germans and the Slavs nonetheless I know He has favored the latter and that it is quite as futile to congratulate Him on the fact as to upbraid Him for it Today it is settled that question so many Russians asked about their country in the last century Was this colossus created for nothing The colossus certainly has a meaning and what a meaning An ideological map would show that it extends beyond its borders that it establishes its frontiers where it pleases and that its presence evokes everywhere the notion less of a crisis than of an epidemic salutary sometimes frequently ruinous always lightninglike The Roman Empire was the enterprise of a city England s was established to remedy the exiguity of an island Germany sought to build hers in order not to smother in an overpopulated territory An unparalleled phenomenon Russia was to justify her projected expansion in the name of her vast spaces The moment I have enough why not have too much Such is the implicit paradox of both her proclamations and her silences By converting infinity into a political category she would overturn the classical concept and the traditional contexts of imperialism and provoke throughout the world a hope too great not to degenerate into chaos With her ten centuries of terrors of shadows and promises Russia was more likely than all others to adapt to the night side of our historical moment Apocalypse suits her wonderfully she has the habit of it the taste for it and functions within it today better than ever since she has visibly changed rhythm Where are you rushing O Russia Gogol already asked perceiving the frenzy she concealed under her apparent immobility We know where now and above all we know that like all nations of an imperial destiny she is more impatient to solve the problems of others than her own Which is to say that our career in time depends on what she will decide or will undertake she holds our future in her hands    Fortunately for us time does not exhaust our substance The indestructible the Elsewhere are conceivable in us apart from us How can we tell The fact remains that as things are now only questions of strategy and metaphysics deserve our interest those that rivet us to history and those that wrench us from it actuality and the absolute the newspapers and the Gospels    I foresee the day when we shall read nothing but telegrams and prayers A remarkable phenomenon the more our immediacy absorbs us the more we feel the need to offset it so that we live in one and the same moment within the world and outside it Hence when we confront the sideshow of empires all that remains for us to do is seek a middle term between the skull s grin and serenity Learning from the Tyrants Whoever has not known the temptation to be first in the city will understand nothing of how politics work nothing of the passion to reduce others to the status of objects and will never grasp the elements that constitute the art of contempt Rare are those who have not suffered a thirst for power to some degree it is natural to us and yet upon close consideration it assumes all the characteristics of a morbid state from which we recover only accidentally or by some internal maturation like the kind that occurred in Charles V when abdicating at Brussels at the height of his glory he taught the world that excessive lassitude could provoke scenes as admirable as excessive courage But whether anomaly or marvel renunciation that challenge to our norms to our identity crops up only at exceptional moments a limitcase that delights the philosopher and dumbfounds the historian Examine yourself when you are a prey to ambition infected by its fever then dissect your fits You will discover that they are preceded by strange symptoms by a particular warmth which will not fail to overpower and alarm you Futuresodden by abuse of hope you suddenly feel responsible for now and what is to come at the heart of a duration answerable to your every frisson and along with which agent of a universal anarchy you dream of exploding Attentive to the events of your brain and the vicissitudes of your blood brooding over your breakdown you wait for its signs and cherish every one Source of disorders of peerless maladies political mania if it floods the intelligence on the other hand favors the instincts and plunges you into a salutary chaos The notion of the good and particularly of the evil you imagine you can accomplish will gladden and exalt you and such will be the tour de force the marvel of your infirmities that they will set you up as master of everyone and everything Around you you will notice an analogous breakdown in those eroded by the same passion As long as they are under its spell they will be unrecognizable victims of an intoxication unlike any other The very timbre of their voice everything in them will change Ambition is a drug that makes its addicts potential madmen These stigmata that lostdog expression those anxious features which seem to be twitching with a sordid ecstasy if you haven t spotted them in yourself or in others you will remain a stranger to the woes and wonders of Power that tonic Hell synthesis of poison and panacea Now imagine the converse process The fever gone lo you are exorcised normal to excess No more ambition hence no means of being someone or something nothing personified the void incarnate glands and viscera clairvoyant bones disabused a body invaded by lucidity pure of itself out of the running and outside of time hung upon a self fixed in a total knowledge without acquaintances This moment vanished where will you rediscover it who will restore it to you Everywhere men frenzied men bewitched a throng of deviants whom reason has deserted in order to take refuge in you in the only one who has understood everything absolute spectator lost among dupes forever refractory to the unanimous farce The interval which separates you from the rest incessantly widening you come to wonder if you haven t perceived some reality hidden from everyone else An infinitesimal or a crucial revelation its content will remain obscure to you The one thing you are sure of is your accession to a wholly new equilibrium promotion of a mind free of all complicity with others Unduly sane more poised than all the sages so you appear to yourself    And if you still resemble the madmen around you you feel that a trifle will distinguish you from them forever imbued with this sensation or this illusion even if you perform the same actions as other men you do so without the same enthusiasm the same conviction Cheating will be for you a question of honor and the only way of conquering your fits or of preventing their recurrence If it has required nothing more or less than a revelation or a collapse you will deduce that those who have not suffered a crisis of this kind will sink ever deeper into the extravagances inherent in our race Have you noted the symmetry In order to become a politician that is in order to have the stuff of a tyrant a certain mental derangement is necessary to cease being so another derangement is no less in order is it not a question after all of transforming our folie des grandeurs To shift from wanting to be first in the city to wanting to be last is by a mutation of pride to trade a dynamic madness for a static one an extraordinary genre of insanity as extraordinary as the renunciation which originates in it and which answering to ascesis rather than to politics has nothing to do with our subject For thousands of years the appetite for power being dispersed in countless tyrannies great and small which have raged here and there the moment seems at hand when that appetite must finally collect and concentrate in order to culminate in a single power expression of that thirst which has devoured which still devours the globe last word of all our dreams of mastery the consummation of our hopes and our aberrations The scattered human herd will be united under the guardianship of one pitiless shepherd a kind of planetary monster before whom the nations will prostrate themselves in an alarm bordering on ecstasy The universe brought to its knees an important chapter of history will be closed Then will begin the disintegration of this new reign and the return to the primal disorder to the old anarchy the smothered hates and vices will reappear and with them the minor tyrants of the bygone cycles After the Great Slavery mediocre ones But as they emerge from their monumental servitudes the survivors will be proud of their shame and of their fear and incomparable victims will celebrate its memory Durer is my prophet The more I observe the procession of the centuries the more I am convinced that the one image capable of revealing its meaning is that of his Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse The ages advance only by treading the hordes underfoot the weak will die no less than the strong and even these riders save one It is for him for his terrible renown that the ages have suffered and groaned I see him looming on the horizon already I detect our whimpers I even hear our screams And the night that will descend upon our bones will not bring peace as it did to the Psalmist but fear Judging by the tyrants it has produced our epoch will have been anything but mediocre To find their like one must go back to the Roman Empire or to the Mongol invasions Even more than Stalin it is Hitler who deserves the credit of having set our century s tone He is important not so much in himself as in what he heralds the rough draft of our future harbinger of a grim advent and of a cosmic hysteria precursor of that grandscale despot who will succeed in unifying the world by science destined not to deliver but to enslave us This was understood long ago it will be understood again one day We are born to exist not to know to be not to assert ourselves Knowledge having irritated and stimulated our appetite for power will lead us inexorably to our ruin It is Genesis not our dreams and our systems that has perceived our condition What we have learned by ourselves whatever knowledge we have extracted from our own core must be expiated by a further disequilibrium fruit of an intimate chaos of a specific or diffuse disease of a disorder at the root of our existence knowledge taints the economy of a human being Each of us must pay for the slightest damage he inflicts upon a universe created for indifference and stagnation sooner or later he will regret not having left it intact If this is true of knowledge it is even truer of ambition for to despoil others involves more serious and more immediate consequences than to despoil mystery or simply matter You begin by making others tremble but others end by transmitting their terrors to you This is why tyrants too live in fear The fear our future master will know will doubtless be heightened by an ominous and unexampled felicity appropriate to a solitary par excellence lording it over all humanity like a god enthroned in dread in omnipotent panic without beginning or end coupling the acrimony of a Prometheus with the impertinence of a Jehovah a scandal for the imagination and the mind a provocation to mythology and theology alike Once monsters have been billeted in a city a kingdom or an empire it is natural that more powerful ones should appear under cover of disaster the liquidation of nations and of our liberties A context in which we achieve the contrary of our aspirations in which we disfigure them unceasingly History is certainly not of an angelic essence Upon considering it closely we conceive only one desire to promote spleen to the dignity of a gnosis All men are more or less envious politicians envious absolutely A man becomes one of these only to the degree that he endures no one beside or above himself To venture upon an undertaking of any kind even the most insignificant is to sacrifice to envy supreme prerogative of the living law and resource of actions When envy leaves you you are no more than an insect a nothing a shadow And a sick man And if envy should sustain you it assuages the failures of pride ministers to your interests conquers apathy and performs more than one miracle Is it not strange that no therapeutics no ethics have recommended its benefits whereas more charitable than providence envy precedes our steps in order to direct them Woe to the man who ignores who neglects or who shuns envy Thereby he shuns the consequences of original sin the need to act to create and to destroy Incapable of envying others what would he seek among them A derelict s destiny awaits him To be saved he must be forced to model himself upon the tyrants to take advantage of their excesses and their misdeeds It is from them and not from the sages that he will learn how to enjoy things once more how to live how to live down Let him trace his way back toward sin let him reintegrate the Fall if he too would share the general degradation that euphoria of damnation in which all creatures are immersed Will he then succeed Nothing is less certain for what he imitates of the tyrants is only their solitude Pity him then pity a wretch who not deigning to entertain his vices or to compete with others falls short of himself and remains beneath all others If actions are fruits of envy it will be understood why political struggle in its ultimate expression comes down to calculations and intrigues likely to assure the elimination of our rivals or our enemies If you would strike home begin by liquidating those who think according to your categories and your prejudices and having traveled the same roads beside you necessarily dream of supplanting or felling you They are the most dangerous of your competitors confine yourself to them the others can wait Were I to seize power my first concern would be to do away with all my friends Any other way of going about it would spoil the metier would discredit tyranny Hitler quite competent in this instance displayed great wisdom by getting rid of Roehm the only man he addressed in the second person singular and of a good number of his early companions Stalin for his part was no less equal to the task as the Moscow purges testify As long as a conqueror succeeds as long as he gains ground he can permit himself any atrocity public opinion absolves him once fortune abandons him the slightest error turns against him Everything depends on the moment when he kills crime in full glory consolidates authority by the sacred fear it inspires The art of making oneself feared and respected is equivalent to the sense of opportunity Mussolini the very type of the clumsy or unlucky despot turned cruel when his failure was manifest and his prestige tarnished a few months of inopportune vengeances voided the work of twenty years Napoleon was much more perspicacious had he had the Duke d Enghien put to death later after the Russian campaign for example he would have bequeathed an image of himself as an executioner instead this murder now appears as a blot on his memory and nothing more If at the limit you can rule without crimes you cannot do so without injustices What counts is to determine the proper proportion of the former and the latter and to commit both only by fits and starts For them to be forgiven they must appear to be the consequences of rage or madness and the tyrant must give the impression of being bloodthirsty by inadvertence pursuing hideous schemes under the mildest appearance Absolute power is not a comfortable matter only ham actors and assassins on a grand scale distinguish themselves in its possession There is nothing more admirable humanly and more lamentable historically than a tyrant demoralized by his scruples And the people it will be asked The thinker or the historian who employs the word without irony disqualifies himself It is all too clear what the people are destined for to suffer events and rulers whims lending themselves to the schemes that weaken and overwhelm them Every political experiment however advanced is performed at the people s expense is carried out against the people the people bear the stigmata of slavery by divine or diabolic decree No use wasting your pity the people s cause admits of no recourse Nations and empires are formed by the people s indulgence of iniquities of which they are the object No head of state no conqueror fails to scorn the people but the people accept this scorn and live on it Were they to cease being weak or victimized were they to disappoint their destiny society would collapse and with it history itself Let us not be overoptimistic nothing in the people permits us to envision such a splendid eventuality As they are the people represent an invitation to despotism The people endure their ordeals sometimes solicit them and rebel against them only to rush into new ones more horrible than the old Revolution being their one luxury they fling themselves into it not so much to derive certain benefits from it or to improve their lot as to acquire for themselves too the right to insolence an advantage which consoles them for their habitual setbacks but which they immediately lose once the privileges of chaos are abolished Since no regime assures their salvation the people adapt themselves to all and to none And from the Flood to the Last Judgment all they can claim is to fulfill their mission honestly to be vanquished To return to our friends beyond the reason invoked to get rid of them there exists another they know our limits and our defects too well friendship comes down to this and nothing more to entertain the slightest illusion as to our virtues Hostile moreover to our promotion to the rank of idol to which public opinion would be quite disposed  determined to safeguard our mediocrity our real dimensions they puncture the myth we would like to create in our behalf they keep us at our exact measure denounce the false image we have of ourselves And when they grant us a little praise they insinuate into it so many dark hints and subtleties that their flattery by dint of circumspection is equivalent to an affront What they secretly long for is our collapse our humiliation and our ruin Identifying our success with a usurpation they keep all their perspicacity for the scrutiny of our thoughts and our actions in order to expose their vanity and show kindness only when we ourselves give evidence of decline So lively is their enthusiasm for the spectacle of our downfall that they really love us at such times sympathize with our miseries avoid their own in order to partake of ours and feast on them During our elevation they observed us pitilessly they were objective but now they can permit themselves the elegance of seeing us as more than we are and of pardoning our former successes being convinced that we will enjoy no new ones And such is their penchant for us that they spend their best hours pitying our deformities and gushing over our defects Caesar s great mistake was not to distrust his own people those who observing him at close hand could not warrant his claim to divine lineage they refused to deify him the mob consented to this but the mob consents to everything Had he done away with his friends Caesar instead of an ignoble death would have enjoyed a prolonged apotheosis the superb deliquescence suited to a real god For all his sagacity he had a certain naivete he did not realize that our intimates are the worst enemies of our statue In a republic that paradise of debility the politician is a petty tyrant who obeys the laws but a strong personality does not respect them or rather respects only those he creates Expert in the unjustifiable such a personality regards the ultimatum as the acme and honor of his career To be in a position to issue one or several certainly involves the kind of pleasure in comparison to which the rest are merely sham I do not believe you can lay claim to the command of affairs if you do not aspire to this unparalleled provocation the most insolent of all even more execrable than the aggression by which it is generally followed Of how many ultimatums is he guilty should be the question asked about a head of state Is there none on his record History disdains him history which wakes up only in the horror chapters and is somnolent in those of tolerance of liberalism regimes in which temperaments wilt and in which the most virulent seem at best watereddown conspirators I pity those who have never conceived a dream of excessive domination nor felt the times seething within themselves In the days when Ahriman was my principle and my god when I thirsted for barbarism I brooded over the cavalcades within myself hordes provoking one sweet catastrophe after the next Foundered as I have nowadays in modesty I nonetheless harbor a weakness for tyrants whom I always prefer to redeemers and prophets I prefer them because they do not take refuge in formulas because their prestige is an equivocal one their cravings selfdestructive whereas the others possessed of a limitless ambition disguise its aims under deceptive precepts retreat from the citizen in order to rule over conscience to occupy it and once implanted there to create permanent ravages without incurring the reproach however merited of indiscretion or sadism Compared to the power of a Buddha a Jesus or a Mohammed what does that of the conquerors signify Abandon the notion of glory unless you are tempted to found a religion Though in this sector most places are taken and men do not resign them readily the leaders of a sect what are they if not founders of a religion to the second degree From the point of view of effectiveness alone a Calvin or a Luther having launched conflicts still unresolved today quite eclipses a Charles V or a Philip II Spiritual Caesarism is more refined and richer in upheavals than Caesarism proper if you would leave a name attach it to a church rather than to an empire You will thereby have neophytes enfeoffed to your fate or to your fads followers you can save or mistreat as you like The leaders of a sect stop at nothing for their very scruples constitute part of their tactics But setting aside the sects an extreme case the mere desire to institute a religious order is worth more in terms of ambition than to rule a city or to conquer by force of arms To insinuate yourself into men s minds to become master of their secrets to despoil them in a sense of themselves of their uniqueness to rob them even of the privilege regarded as inviolable of conscience what tyrant what conqueror has aimed so high Invariably the religious strategy will be subtler and more suspect than the political Merely compare Loyola s Spiritual Exercises so shrewd in their detached tone with the barefaced policies of The Prince and you will measure the distance separating the cunning of the confessional from that of a chancellery or a throne The more intense a spiritual leader s appetite for power the more he is concerned not without reason to limit it in others Who among us left to himself would not take up space air itself and regard himself as its owner A society that seeks to be perfect should make the straitjacket fashionable or else obligatory For man moves only to do evil Religions striving to cure him of his obsession with power and to give a nonpolitical direction to his aspirations join the regimes of authority since like them though with other methods they seek to dominate man to humble his nature his native megalomania What consolidated their credit what enabled them to triumph hitherto over our inclinations I mean the ascetic element is precisely what has ceased to gain a hold over us A perilous liberation was to result ungovernable in every sense fully emancipated released from our chains and our superstitions we are ripe for the remedies of terror He who aspires to total freedom achieves it only to return to his point of departure to his initial servitude Whence the vulnerability of developed societies amorphous masses with neither idols nor ideals dangerously lacking in fanaticism devoid of organic links and so helpless amid their whims or their convulsions that they anticipate and this is the sole dream of which they are still capable the security and dogmas of the yoke Unfit to assume any longer the responsibility for their destiny they scheme even more than primitive societies for the advent of despotism to be delivered from the last vestiges of an exhausted drained and futilely obsessive appetite for power A world without tyrants would be as boring as a zoo without hyenas The master we await in terror will be precisely a connoisseur of corruption in whose presence we shall all figure as carrion Let him come let him sniff us out let him wallow in our exhalations Already a new odor hangs over the universe In order not to yield to political temptation we must keep a close watch over ourselves at every moment How to manage this especially in a democratic regime whose essential vice is to permit anyone at all to seek power and to give free rein to his ambitions There results a pullulation of braggarts of futureless quibblers commonplace lunatics whom fatality refuses to sign incapable of any true frenzy inept at both triumph and collapse Yet it is their very nullity that permits and secures our liberties threatened as they are by exceptional personalities A selfrespecting republic should fall into a panic upon the appearance of a great man should banish him from its midst or at least forbid a legend to grow up around him If a republic is reluctant to do such things it is because dazzled by its scourge it no longer believes in its institutions or in its reasons for being It is entangled in its laws and these which protect its enemy dispose and commit the republic to failure Succumbing to the excesses of its own tolerance it spares the adversary that will not spare it in turn authorizes the myths that erode and destroy it letting itself be trapped in the suavities of its own executioner Does a republic deserve to subsist when its very principles invite it to disappear Tragic paradox of freedom the mediocre men who alone make its exercise possible cannot guarantee its duration We owe everything to their insignificance and we lose everything by it Thus they are always unequal to their task It is this mediocrity that I hated in the days when I unreservedly loved the tyrants of whom we can never say often enough that unlike their caricature every democrat is an operetta tyrant  they have a destiny even too much of one And if I made them into a sort of cult it was because having the instinct of command they do not lower themselves to dialogue or to arguments they give orders issue decrees without condescending to justify their actions whence their cynicism which I set above all virtues and all vices the sign of superiority even of nobility which in my eyes separated them from the rest of mortal men Unable to render myself worthy of them by action I hoped to do so by words by the practice of sophism and enormity to be as odious with the means of mind as they were with those of power to devastate by language to blow up the word and with it the world to explode with one and the other and finally to collapse under their debris Now deceived by these extravagances by all that once enlivened my days I have come to dream of a city a marvel of moderation ruled by a team of slightly senile octogenarians involuntarily amenable yet still lucid enough to make good use of their decrepitudes exempt from desires from regrets from doubts and so concerned with the general equilibrium and the public welfare that they would regard even a smile as a sign of profligacy and of subversion And such is at present my fallen state that democrats themselves seem to me too ambitious too mad I should still be their accomplice if their hatred of tyranny were pure but they abominate it only because it relegates them to private life and confronts them with their nothingness The only order of greatness to which they can attain is that of failure Liquidation suits them well they are comfortable in it and when they excel there they deserve our respect As a general rule in order to lead a state to ruin there must be a certain ardor particular tendencies even talents But it may happen that circumstances are propitious the task is then easy as is proved by the example of countries in decline lacking inner resources that fall prey to the insoluble to lacerations to the play of contradictory opinions and tendencies Such was the case of ancient Greece With respect to failure that of Greece was perfect one might say that she worked at it in order to offer it as a model and to discourage posterity from making similar attempts Starting from the third century BC her substance wasted her idols wavering her political life torn between the Macedonian party and the Roman Greece resorted in order to solve her crises to remedy the curse of her liberties to foreign domination and for over five hundred years accepted Rome s yoke impelled to do so by the very degree of refinement and gangrene to which she had attained Once polytheism was reduced to a heap of fables she would lose her religious and with it her political genius two realities indissolubly linked to call in question the gods is to call in question the city over which they preside Greece could not survive them any more than Rome would survive hers That Greece lost with her religious instinct her political instinct we are easily enough convinced by regarding her reactions during the civil war always on the wrong side joining Pompey against Caesar Brutus against Octavius and Antony Antony against Octavius Greece regularly espoused misfortune as if she had found in the continuity of fiasco a guarantee of stability the solace and convenience of the irreparable The more the evolved nations weary of their gods and the gods themselves weary of them  the more readily they risk succumbing The citizen is refined at the expense of institutions no longer believing in them he can no longer defend them When the Romans by contact with the Greeks finally lost their vulgarity that is weakened the days of the republic were numbered The Romans resigned themselves to dictatorship perhaps longed for it in secret no Rubicon without the complicities of a collective fatigue The death principle inherent in all regimes is more perceptible in republics than in dictatorships the former proclaim and parade it the latter disguise and deny it Nonetheless despotisms thanks to their methods can ensure a longer and above all a more comfortable duration they solicit they cultivate events while the others gladly forgo them freedom being a state of absence absence likely to    degenerate when citizens exhausted by the burden of being themselves aspire to nothing more than humiliation and defeat thereby satisfying their nostalgia for servitude Nothing more distressing than the exhaustion and the rout of a republic it should be described in the tonality of elegy or epigram or better still in that of Montesquieu s Spirit of the Laws When Sulla sought to restore Rome her liberty she could no longer receive it she retained but a faint vestige of virtue and since she had continually less of this instead of waking after Caesar Tiberius Caius Claudius Nero Domitian she was ever more enslaved each blow fell upon the tyrant none upon tyranny This is so because tyranny is just what one can develop a taste for since it so happens that man prefers to wallow in fear rather than to face the anguish of being himself Generalize the phenomenon and the Caesars appear how to blame them when they answer the requirements of our misery and the pleas of our cowardice They even deserve to be admired they fling themselves upon assassination constantly brood upon it accept its horrors and its ignominy and devote all their thoughts to it to the point of forgetting suicide and exile less spectacular formulas though gentler and more agreeable Having opted for the most difficult they can flourish only in uncertain times sustaining chaos or else throttling it The epoch favorable to their advance coincides with the end of a cycle of civilization This is obvious with regard to the ancient world and it will be no less so with regard to ours which is heading straight for a much more considerable tyranny than the one rampant in the first centuries of our era The most elementary meditation on the historical process of which we are the result reveals that Caesarism will be the mode by which the sacrifice of our liberties will be consummated If the continents are to be welded together unified it is force that will do the job not persuasion like the Roman Empire the one to come will be forged by the sword and will be established with our unanimous collaboration since our very terrors demand it If you accuse me of extravagance I answer that it is indeed possible that I am anticipating somewhat hastily The dates are of no importance The first Christians expected the world to end from one minute to the next they were off by merely a few thousand years   In an entirely different order of expectation I too may be mistaken but finally one neither tests nor proves a vision mine of the coming tyranny strikes me as so decisively apparent that it seems unworthy to attempt to demonstrate its wellfoundedness It is a certitude that partakes of both the shudder and the axiom To it I adhere with the passion of a convulsionary and the assurance of a geometrician No I am not extravagant or mistaken And I could not even say with Keats that the sentiment of shadows invades me Rather it is a light that assails me precise and intolerable by which I envisage not the end of the world that would be extravagant but the end of a style of civilization and of a way of writing To confine myself to what is at hand and more particularly to Europe it seems to me with a final distinctness that unity will not be formed as some may suppose by agreement and deliberation but by violence according to the laws that govern the construction of empires For these old nations steeped in their provincial obsessions to renounce and be released from them will require a hand of iron for they will never consent to such a thing of their own accord Once enslaved communing within humiliation and defeat they can devote themselves to a supranational enterprise under the vigilant and scornful eye of their new master Their servitude will be brilliant they will nurse it with eagerness and delicacy lavishing indeed the last remains of their genius upon it They will pay dearly for the luster of their slavery Thus Europe ahead of time will set as always an example to the world and win renown in her role as protagonist and as victim Her mission consisted in prefiguring the ordeals of others in suffering for them and before them in offering them her own convulsions as a model so that they would be dispensed from inventing original personal ones The more Europe exerted herself for them the more she tormented herself in her struggles the better they lived as parasites upon her pangs as heirs of her revolutions In the future too they will turn to her till the day when spent she can no longer bequeath them anything but her leavings Odyssey of Rancor We spend the prime of our sleepless nights in mentally mangling our enemies rending their entrails wringing their veins trampling each organ to mush and charitably leaving them the skeleton to enjoy Whereupon we forbear overcome by fatigue and drop off to sleep A wellearned rest after so much scruple so much zeal Moreover we must recover our strength in order to begin all over again the next night resuming a labor that would discourage the most Herculean butcher No doubt about it having enemies is no sinecure The program of our nights would be less crowded if by day we could give our resentment free rein To achieve not even happiness merely equilibrium we need to liquidate a good number of our kind to inflict a regular hecatomb in the fashion of our remote and relaxed ancestors Not so relaxed it will be objected the caveman s demographic poverty denying him any continuous opportunity for slaughter So be it But he had compensations he was better provided for than we are rushing off to hunt at all hours falling upon wild beasts it was still his own species he was destroying Bloodbaptized he could readily indulge his frenzy no need for him to disguise and defer his sanguinary intentions whereas we are doomed to review and repress our lust for rapine till it shrivels within us reduced to curbing to postponing even to renouncing our revenge To forswear vengeance is to chain oneself to forgiveness to founder in pardon to be tainted by the hatred smothered within    Spared our enemy obsesses and aggrieves us especially when we have resolved to abhor him no longer Indeed we truly forgive him only if we have promoted or witnessed his fall if he affords us the spectacle of an ignominious end or supreme reconciliation if we contemplate his corpse Such happiness in truth is rare and not to be relied on For our enemy is never felled always erect always triumphant it is his nature to loom up before us flouting our timid gibes by his fullblown scorn Nothing is more deleterious to happiness than the duty to resist our primal depths to turn a deaf ear to the call of the wild The result Those torments of a civilized man reduced to smiling harnessed to calumny and disconsolate at having to kill without making a move by the mere power of the Word that invisible dagger Various are the ways of cruelty Supplanting the jungle conversation permits our bestiality to function without immediate damage to our kind If by the whim of some malefic power we should lose the use of speech no one would survive unscathed The need to kill inscribed in every cell we have managed to transfer to our thoughts only this feat accounts for the possibility and the permanence of society May we conclude that we have won out over our native corruption our homicidal talents That would be to miscalculate the Word s capacities and to exaggerate its powers The cruelty which we have inherited which we wield is not to be so readily ruled as long as we do not capitulate to it altogether as long as we have not used it up we preserve it in our secret self we are never released from it Your real murderer premeditates his deed plans it out performs it and by doing so frees himself for a time from his impulses on the other hand the man who does not kill because he cannot though he endures the craving to do so the unrealized assassin let us say the elegiac trifler of carnage mentally commits countless crimes and suffers far worse for them since he drags with him the regret for all the abominations he cannot perpetrate In the same way the man who shrinks from revenge poisons his days curses both his scruples and that act against nature pardon Doubtless revenge is not always sweet once it is consummated we feel inferior to our victim or else we are tangled in the subtleties of remorse so vengeance too has its venom though it comes closer to what we are to what we feel to the very law of the self it is also healthier than magnanimity The Furies were held to antedate the gods Zeus included Vengeance before Divinity This is the major intuition of ancient mythology Those who whether from impotence lack of opportunity or grandstand generosity have not reacted to their enemies wiles bear upon their faces the stigmata of repressed rage the traces of affront and opprobrium the dishonor of having forgiven The blows they have not dealt are turned against themselves and collaborate within their features to illustrate their cowardice Bewildered and obsessed cornered by shame saturated with bitterness refractory to others as to themselves as stifled as they are ready to explode they seem to be making a superhuman effort to ward off a risk of convulsion The greater their impatience the more they must disguise it and when they cannot they give way at last but to no purpose stupidly for it is in absurdity that they founder like those who having accumulated too much bile and too much silence at the crucial moment lose all their powers before their enemies of whom they show themselves to be unworthy Their failure will further enhance their spite and each experience however trifling will signify for them a further dose of gall We become goodnatured we become good only by destroying the best of our nature only by submitting our body to the discipline of anemia and our mind to that of oblivion As long as we preserve even a trace of memory forgiveness comes down to a struggle with our instincts an aggression against our own ego It is our flagrancies that keep us in tune with ourselves ensure our continuity link us to our past stimulate our powers of evocation in the same way our imaginations function only in hope of others misfortune in the raptures of disgust in that disposition which impels us if not to commit infamies at least to contemplate them How could it be otherwise on a planet where flesh propagates with the shamelessness of a scourge Wherever we go we come up against the human a repulsive ubiquity before which we fall into stupor and revolt a perplexity on fire Once when space was less crowded less infested by mankind certain sects indubitably inspired by a beneficent power advocated and practiced castration by an infernal paradox they have been suppressed just when their doctrine would have been more opportune and more salutary than ever before Maniacs of procreation bipeds with devalued faces we have lost all appeal for each other And it is only on a halfdeserted earth peopled at most by a few thousand inhabitants that our physiognomies might recover their ancient glamour The multiplication of our kind borders on the obscene the duty to love them on the preposterous Which does not keep our thoughts from being contaminated by the presence of the human from stinking of the human and from being unable to cleanse themselves of it Of what truths are we capable to what revelation can we rise when this pestilence asphyxiates the mind and disqualifies it from considering anything but the pernicious and fetid animal whose emanations it endures He who is too weak to declare war on mankind must never forget in his moments of fervor to pray for a second Flood more radical than the first Knowledge subverts love in proportion as we penetrate our own secrets we come to loathe our kind precisely because they resemble us When we have no further illusions about ourselves we retain none about others the unspeakable that we discover by introspection we extend by a legitimate generalization to other mortals depraved in their essence we rightly endow them with all the vices which oddly enough most of us turn out to be unfit for or averse to ferreting out to observing in ourselves or in others How easy it is to do evil everyone manages but to assume it explicitly to acknowledge its inexorable reality is an unwonted feat In practice anyone can compete with the devil in theory this is not the case To commit horrors and to conceive horror are two irreducible actions no common ground between the experience of cynicism and cynicism in the abstract Let us beware of those who subscribe to a reassuring philosophy who believe in the Good and willingly erect it into an idol they could not have done so if honestly peering into themselves they had sounded their depths or their miasmas but those rare it is true who have been indiscreet or unfortunate enough to plunge all the way down to the bottom of their beings they know how to judge man they can no longer love him for they no longer love themselves though remaining and this will be their punishment nailed even faster to themselves than before    In order to keep the faith our own and others  in order to lose sight of the illusory character the nullity of all action nature has made us opaque to ourselves subject to a blindness which generates and rules the world Were we to undertake an exhaustive selfscrutiny disgust would paralyze us we would be doomed to a thankless existence The incompatibility between action and selfknowledge seems to have escaped Socrates otherwise in his capacity as pedagogue as man s ally would he have dared adopt the oracle s motto with all the abysses of renunciation it implies As long as we possess a will of our own and as long as we are bound to it this is what Lucifer has been blamed for  revenge is an imperative an organic necessity which defines the universe of diversity of the self and which can have no meaning in the universe of identity If it were true that we breathe in the One Plotinus  on whom would we take revenge where every difference is blurred where we commune in the indiscernible and lose our contours there As a matter of fact we breathe in the multiple our kingdom is that of the I and through the I there is no salvation To exist is to condescend to sensation hence to selfaffirmation whence notknowing with its direct consequence revenge  the principle of phantasmagoria source of our peregrination on earth The more we try to wrest ourselves from our ego the deeper we sink into it Try as we will to explode it just when we suppose we have succeeded there it is apparently more selfassured than ever whatever we do to destroy it merely augments its strength and solidity and such is its vigor and its perversity that it nourishes still more in affliction than in joy As with the ego so a fortiori with actions When we imagine ourselves liberated from them we are anchored in them more fixedly than ever even when corrupted into simulacra actions prevail over us subject us to themselves Whether an enterprise is undertaken reluctantly or by persuasion we always end by adhering to it becoming its slaves or its dupes No man stirs without allying himself to the multiple to appearances to the I To act is to forfeit the absolute Action s sovereignty comes let us admit it straight off from our vices which master a greater contingent of existence than our virtues possess If we espouse the cause of life and more particularly that of history they seem useful to the supreme degree is it not thanks to our vices that we cling to things and that we cut something of a figure here on earth Inseparable from our condition vices are ubiquitous only the puppet is without them To try to boycott them is to conspire against ourselves to lay down our arms in the midst of battle to discredit ourselves in our neighbor s eyes or to remain forever void The miser deserves to be envied not for his money but precisely for his avarice his real treasure By attaching the individual to a sector of reality implanting him there vices which do nothing lightly occupy him intensify him justify his alienation from the vague The practical value of manias of derangements and aberrations is irrefutable insofar as we limit ourselves to this world to the here and now where our desires confront one another where competitiveness is rampant even a minor vice is more effective than a major virtue The political dimension of beings taking the political as the fulfillment of the biological safeguards the realm of actions the realm of dynamic abjection To know ourselves is to identify the sordid motive of our gestures the inadmissible that is inscribed within our substance the totality of patent or clandestine miseries on which our welfare depends Whatever emanates from the inferior zones of our nature is invested with strength whatever comes from below stimulates we invariably produce and perform better out of jealousy and greed than out of nobility and disinterestedness Sterility awaits those who do not deign to encourage or divulge their flaws Whatever the domain to which we owe allegiance in order to excel there we must cultivate the insatiable aspect of our character must urge our inclinations to fanaticism to intolerance to vindictiveness Nothing is more suspect than fruitfulness If purity is what you seek if you aspire to some inner transparency make haste to abdicate your talents abandon the realm of actions exile yourself from the human renounce to use the pious jargon the conversation of creatures Great gifts far from excluding great defects actually stipulate and reinforce them When the saints accuse themselves of this or that sin we must take them at their word The very interest they take in others suffering testifies against them Their pity pity in general what is pity but the vice of kindness Deriving its effectiveness from the wicked principle it conceals pity delights in others ordeals postulates hell as a promised land it cannot do without and if it is not destructive in and of itself nonetheless profits by all that destroys Extreme aberration of kindness pity ends up as its own negation in the saints even more than among ourselves To be convinced of this merely frequent their lives and contemplate the voracity with which they fling themselves upon our sins their nostalgia for illustrious disgrace or interminable remorse their exasperation before the mediocrity of our misdeeds and their regret at not having to torment themselves more deeply for our redemption High as one mounts one remains a captive of one s nature of one s original debacle Men of great ambitions or simply of talents are monsters superb and hideous monsters who seem to be plotting some terrible crime and in truth they are preparing their work    creating it in secret like criminals must they not crush all those who would take the same path as themselves A man strives and creates only to crush beings or Being rivals or the Rival At every level minds war upon each other delight and wallow in defiance the saints themselves envy and exclude one another like the gods moreover witness those perpetual scuffles which are the scourge of every Olympus Anyone approaching the same domain or the same problem as ourselves jeopardizes our originality our privileges the integrity of our existence strips us of our chimeras and our chances The task of casting him down of defeating or at least disparaging him assumes the form of a mission even of a fatality We are satisfied only by someone who abstains who in no way manifests himself yet he must also not accede to the rank of model the acknowledged sage excites and legitimates our envy Even an idler if he distinguishes himself in his sloth if he shines there risks being reviled he attracts too much attention to himself    The ideal would be a wellproportioned effacement No one has managed that We acquire glory only to the detriment of others of those who seek it too and there is no reputation that is not won at the cost of countless abuses The man who has emerged from anonymity or who merely strives to do so proves that he has eliminated every scruple from his life that he has triumphed over his conscience if by some chance he ever had such a thing To renounce one s name is to be doomed to inactivity to cling to it is to degrade oneself Must we either pray or write prayers exist or express ourselves One thing is sure the principle of expansion immanent in our nature makes us regard others merits as an encroachment upon our own a continual provocation If glory is forbidden or inaccessible we blame those who have attained it they could have done so we believe only by keeping us from it it was ours by right belonged to us and without the machinations of these usurpers it would have been ours Much more than property it is glory which is theft motto of the embittered and to a degree of us all The delights of being unknown or misunderstood are rare yet upon consideration are they not equivalent to the pride of having triumphed over honors and vanities to the desire for an unwonted renown for fame without a public Which is certainly the supreme form the summum of the appetite for glory Nor is the word too strong it is indeed an appetite which thrusts its roots into our senses and which answers to a physiological necessity to a cry of our vitals In order to forsake it in order to conquer it we should have to meditate upon our insignificance assent to it fully yet derive no pleasure from doing so for our certainty of being nothing leads if we are not careful to complacency and pride we do not perceive our own nothingness or linger over it for long without clinging to it    sensually A certain happiness enters into our lust to denounce the fragility of happiness and in the same way when we profess to scorn glory we are far from being unfamiliar with the thirst for it we sacrifice to glory just when we proclaim its inanity A loathsome desire certainly but inherent in our organization in order to extirpate it we must condemn flesh and spirit alike to petrifaction must compete with the mineral kingdom in unconcern then forget the others evacuate them from our consciousness for the mere fact of their presence radiant and fulfilled wakens our evil genius who commands us to sweep them away and to forsake our obscurity in order to eclipse their brilliance We resent everyone who has chosen to live in the same epoch as ourselves those who run at our side who hamper our stride or leave us behind In clearer terms all contemporaries are odious We resign ourselves to the superiority of a dead man never to that of the living whose very existence constitutes a reproach and a censure an invitation to the intoxications of modesty That so many of our kind surpass us is as obvious as it is intolerable and to be evaded by arrogating to ourselves the advantage of being unique We gasp for breath among our competitors or our models what a comfort to be among their tombs The disciple himself breathes freely and enjoys his freedom only upon the master s death All of us insofar as we exist pray for the downfall of those who eclipse us by their gifts their labors or their feats and with greed feverish greed we await their last moments Suppose this one climbs in our own realm above us reason enough for us to want to be rid of him how to forgive him the admiration he inspires the secret and vexatious worship we shower upon him Let him be gone let him fade away let him be done with in fact be dead if we are to revere him without laceration without acrimony if our martyrdom is to cease With any brains at all instead of thanking us for our propensity he would hold it against us would tax us with imposture reject us with disgust or commiseration Too full of himself with no experience of the calvary of admiration or of the contradictory impulses it provokes in us he never suspects that by putting him on a pedestal we have consented to demean ourselves and that this humiliation will have to be paid for by him could we ever forget what a blow unwittingly we grant him that he has dealt to the sweet illusion of our singularity and our value Having committed the imprudence or the abuse of letting himself be adored too long now he must suffer the consequences by the decree of our lassitude he turns from a real god to a false one reduced to a regret that he took up so much of our time Perhaps we venerated him only in hopes of someday taking our revenge If we love to prostrate ourselves we love still more to deny those before whom we have groveled Every undermining labor exalts confers energy whence the urgency whence the practical infallibility of vile sentiments Envy which makes a fool into a daredevil a worm into a tiger whips up our nerves ignites our blood communicates to the body a shudder that keeps it from going soft lends the most anodyne countenance an expression of concentrated ardor without envy there would be no events nor even a world indeed it is envy that has made man possible permitted him to gain a name for himself to accede to greatness by the fall by that rebellion against the anonymous glory of paradise to which any more than the Fallen Angel his inspiration and his model he could not adapt himself Everything that breathes and moves testifies to the initial taint Forever associated with the effervescences of Satan patron of Time scarcely distinct from God being merely His visible countenance  we are victims of this genius of sedition who persuades us to perform our task as living men by rousing us against one another in a deplorable combat no doubt but a fortifying one we emerge from torpor enlivened whenever triumphing over our Higher Impulses we become aware of our role as destroyers Admiration on the contrary by eroding our substance depresses and ultimately demoralizes us hence we turn against the admired anyone guilty of having inflicted upon us the task of raising ourselves to his level He must not be surprised if our ascent toward him is followed by backsliding or if we sometimes revise our enthusiasms It is our instinct for selfpreservation that reminds us of our duty to ourselves that compels such reassessments We do not cease to esteem or to extol someone because his merits are in question but because we can enhance ourselves only at his expense Without being exhausted our capacity for admiration suffers a crisis during which given over to the pleasures and paroxysms of apostasy we enlist our idols in order to repudiate and smash them one after the other and this iconoclastic frenzy shameful in itself is nonetheless the force that vivifies our faculties A vulgar hence effective goad to inspiration resentment triumphs in art which cannot do without it any more than philosophy moreover to think is to take a cunning revenge in which we camouflage our baseness and conceal our lower instincts Judged by what it excludes and rejects a system suggests a settling of accounts skillfully executed Philosophers like poets like everyone who has something to say are pitiless If the gentle and the tepid leave no trace it is not for lack of perspicacity or of depth but of aggression which nonetheless implies no integral vitality At grips with the world the thinker is often a weakling a rachitic runt all the more virulent for realizing his own biological inferiority and suffering from it The more he is rejected by life the more he tries to master it to subjugate it though unable to do so Sufficiently disinherited to pursue happiness yet too proud to find it or to resign himself to it at once real and unreal formidable and impotent the thinker suggests a synthesis of beast and ghost a madman who lives by metaphor An abiding vigilant rancor can constitute all by itself the armature of an individual weakness of character proceeds in most cases from a poor memory Not to forget an insult is one of the secrets of success an art invariably possessed by men with strong convictions for every conviction consists chiefly of hate and only secondly of love Perplexities on the other hand are the lot of the man who equally inept at hating or loving has nothing to choose not even his lacerations If he would assert himself shake off his apathy play a part let him invent enemies and cling to them let him waken his dormant cruelty or the memory of outrages imprudently despised To take the smallest step forward even just to exist requires a minimum of villainy Let no one abandon his holdings in indignity if he wants to persevere in being Rancor preserves if moreover we can sustain it nurture it we avoid softness and insipidity We should even encourage it toward things what better tactic for arming ourselves against them for lowering ourselves advantageously to reality A pure sentiment lacking any vital charge is a contradiction in terms an impossibility a fiction Indeed there is no such thing even if we sought it in religion a realm where it is supposed to flourish We do not undertake to exist still less to pray without sacrificing to the devil In most cases we attach ourselves to God in order to take revenge on life to punish it to signify we can do without it that we have found something better and we also attach ourselves to God in horror of men in reprisal against them to make them understand that having entree elsewhere we do not find their society indispensable and that if we grovel before Him it is in order not to have to grovel before them Without this shabby murky secret element our fervor would lack energy perhaps it could not even exist The unreality of pure sentiments we might suppose that it was the sick who could best reveal such a thing to us that this was their mission and the meaning of their ordeals Nothing more natural since it is in the sick that the flaws of our race are concentrated and exacerbated Having ranged through the various species having striven with more or less success to imprint its sign upon them Disease weary of its progress doubtless longed for rest and sought someone over whom to declare its supremacy in peace someone who would prove quite amenable to its whims and its despotism someone on whom it could really count Experimenting left and right Disease suffered many a failure until at last it found man unless it created him Thus we are all sick men some potentially so the mass of the healthy the type of placid harmless humanity the others actual the diseased strictly speaking a cynical and impassioned minority Two categories close in appearance irreconcilable in fact a considerable gap separates possible pain from the real thing Instead of turning against ourselves against the fragility of our complexion we make others responsible for our condition for the slightest discomfort even for a headache we accuse them of making us pay for their health of being nailed to our sickbed so that they can move about as they choose With what pleasure would we not see our disease or our discomfort spread gain a following and if possible extend to all humanity Disappointed in our hopes we resent everyone near or far we harbor exterminating sentiments we want others to be even more seriously threatened than ourselves let the hour of final agony of a splendid mutual annihilation toll for all the living Only great sufferings unforgettable sufferings detach us from the world the others average pains morally the worst kind enslave us to it because they stir up the soul s lower depths We must be on guard against the sick they have character and can exploit and sharpen their rancors One day one of their number decided never again to shake hands with a well person he soon discovered that many of those he had suspected of health were at bottom unscathed by it Then why should he make enemies for himself on hasty suspicions From all evidence this man was more reasonable than the rest and had scruples not habitual to the breed he belonged to a frustrated insatiable and prophetic gang which ought to be isolated because it seeks to overturn the world in order to impose its law Instead let us put matters in the hands of the normal the only ones disposed to leave things as they are indifferent to both past and future they confine themselves to the present installing themselves there without hopes and without regrets But as soon as health wavers a man dreams of nothing but paradise and inferno that is he reforms he seeks to amend the irreparable to redress or demolish society which he can no longer endure because he can no longer endure himself A man who suffers is a public menace a disequilibrated being all the more fearsome in that he usually has to conceal his pain the source of his energy We cannot assert ourselves or play a role here on earth without help from some infirmity and there is no dynamism that is not the sign of physiological misery or internal devastation When we know equilibrium we care for nothing we do not even feel attached to life for we are life once equilibrium is destroyed instead of identifying ourselves with things we think of nothing but overthrowing or molding them Pride emanates from the tension and the strain of consciousness from the impossibility of existing naively Now the sick never naive substitute for the given a false idea of it that they create so that their perceptions and even their reflexes participate in a system of obsessions so imperious they cannot help codifying and inflicting them on others perfidious legislators concerned to make their pains obligatory in order to strike down those resolved not to share them If the healthy seem more accommodating if they have no reason to be intractable it is because they are unaware of the explosive virtues of humiliation He who has suffered humiliation will never forget its effects and will know no rest until he has put them into a work capable of perpetuating its pangs To create is to bequeath one s sufferings wanting others to enter into them to assume them to be impregnated by them and to live them over again This is true of a poem this can be true of the cosmos Without the hypothesis of a feverish deity subject to convulsions giddy with epilepsy we could not explain a universe that everywhere shows signs of an original sputum    And we divine the essence of such a God only when we ourselves suffer fits such as He must have known at the moments He came to grips with Chaos We are reminded of Him by everything in ourselves that resists form or good sense by our confusions and our delirium we join Him by supplications in which we dislocate ourselves in Him and Him in us for He is close to us whenever something in ourselves breaks down and when in our fashion we too measure ourselves against Chaos A summary theology Contemplating this botched Creation how can we help incriminating its Author how above all suppose Him able and adroit Any other God would have given evidence of more competence or more equilibrium than this one errors and confusion wherever you look Impossible to absolve Him but impossible too not to understand Him And we understand Him by everything in ourselves that is fragmentary incomplete and inopportune His enterprise bears the stigmata of the provisional yet it is not time He lacked in order to finish things off He was to our misfortune inexplicably rushed By a legitimate ingratitude and to make Him feel the brunt of our ill humor we set about experts in counterCreation deteriorating His structure rendering even messier a work already compromised from the start Doubtless it would be wiser and more elegant to have nothing to do with it to leave it as it is not to exact reprisal for His own incapacities but since He has transmitted His defects to us we cannot show Him much solicitude If all things considered we prefer Him to humanity this does not exempt Him from our resentment Perhaps we have conceived Him only to justify and regenerate our rebellions to afford them a worthy object to keep them from spoiling and dwindling reinforcing them by the inspiriting abuse of sacrilege an answer to the arguments and seductions of discouragement We are never quite finished with God Treating Him on equal footing as an enemy is an impertinence that fortifies stimulates and how much we must pity those He has ceased to annoy What luck on the other hand to be able without embarrassment to make Him assume responsibility for all our miseries to overwhelm and insult Him to spare Him nothing at any moment not even in our prayers To rancor on which we have no monopoly He too is subject as many a Sacred Book attests  for solitude however absolute is no defense against it That even for God it is not good to be alone signifies in short let Us create the world to have something to get back at on which to practice Our verve and Our victimization And when the world goes up in smoke there remains whether one is man or God this subtle form of vengeance vengeance against oneself an absorbing occupation anything but destructive since it proves that one still makes terms with life that one adheres to it precisely by the tortures one inflicts upon oneself Hosanna is not one of our habits Equally impure though in different ways divine and diabolic principles are easy to conceive of angels on the contrary exceed our grasp And if we cannot quite envision them if they fluster our imagination it is because unlike God the devil and all the rest of us angels alone when they are not the Exterminating variety thrive without the spur of rancor And need we add without that of flattery which busy animals like ourselves cannot do without We depend in order to create upon the opinion of our neighbors we solicit we implore their homage we mercilessly pursue those among them who offer us nuanced or even equitable judgments and if we had the means we should oblige them to bear exaggerated ridiculous ones out of all proportion to our aptitudes or our accomplishments All measured praise being identified with injustice objectivity with provocation reserve with insult what keeps the universe from flinging itself at our feet What we crave what we want to see in others eyes is that servile expression an unconcealed infatuation with our gestures and our lucubrations the avowal of an ardor without second thoughts an ecstasy before our nothingness A profiteering moralist a psychologist paired with a parasite the flatterer knows our weakness and shamelessly exploits it So far have we fallen that we accept all excesses premeditated and false claims of admiration at face value without a blush for we prefer the enthusiasms of mendacity to the indictment of silence Commingled with our physiology our viscera flattery affects our glands stimulates our secretions and seeks out moreover our basest feelings hence our most profound and natural ones provoking in us a secondrate euphoria to which we give our flabbergasted attention quite as flabbergasted we contemplate the even more marked effects of censure which invade and overwhelm the very depths of our being Since no one rebukes us with impunity we reply either by immediately striking back or by generating gall the equivalent of a seasoned riposte Not to react would require a metamorphosis a total transformation not only of our dispositions but of our organs themselves Such an operation not being imminent we bow with good grace to the maneuvers of flattery and the sovereignty of rancor To repress the need for revenge is to try to dismiss time to deny events the possibility of occurring it is to seek to get rid of evil and with it of action But action a hunger for defeat consubstantial with the self is a fury over which we triumph only at those moments when weary of tormenting our enemies we abandon them to their fate leaving them to rot because we do not love them enough to bother to destroy them to dissect them to make them the object of our nocturnal anatomies Yet the frenzy comes upon us again once that lust for appearances revives that passion for the absurd which constitutes our passion for existence Even reduced to the infinitesimal life feeds on itself tends toward an increase of being seeks to grow for no reason by a dishonoring and irrepressible automatism One and the same thirst devours gnat and elephant with any luck it might have been vanquished in humanity we have seen that this was not the case the craving breaks out everywhere with increased intensity among the bedridden themselves Capacity for desistance constitutes the sole criterion of spiritual progress it is not when things leave us it is when we leave them that we accede to an inner nakedness to that extremity where we no longer affiliate ourselves with this world or with ourselves and where victory signifies resignation serene selfrenunciation without regrets and above all without melancholy for melancholy discreet and aerial as it may appear still derives from resentment it is a reverie stamped with harshness a jealousy disguised as languor a vaporous rancor but rancor As long as we remain in its power we desist from nothing we are bogged down in the I yet without release from others whom we think of all the more obsessively if we have not managed to prise ourselves loose from    ourselves At the very moment we promise ourselves to vanquish vengeance we feel it stirring within us more powerfully than ever ready to take the offensive Forgiven transgressions suddenly demand reparation invade our sleepless nights and even more our dreams turning them into nightmares venturing so deep into our abysses that they end by forming their very substance If this be so what is the use of acting out the farce of noble sentiments gambling on a metaphysical risk or anticipating redemption To take revenge even if only in thought is irremediably to place ourselves on this side of the absolute Absolute indeed Not only insults forgotten or silently endured but even those we have repaid harass and haunt us to the end of our days and this obsession which should disqualify us in our own eyes actually succors us makes us eager for battle The slightest affront a word a glance tainted by some restriction these we never pardon a living person Nor do we even pardon such things after that person s death The image of his corpse doubtless assuages us and compels us to indulgence once the image blurs and in our memory the face of the living man prevails over and replaces that of the deceased our old rancors rise up again resume all the more powerfully with that whole procession of shames and humiliations which will last as long as ourselves and whose memory would be eternal had immortality devolved upon us Since everything wounds and insults us why not swathe ourselves in skepticism and try to find a remedy for our distress This would be only another deception since Doubt is merely a product of our irritations and our grievances the instrument a flayed man uses to suffer and to cause suffering If we demolish certainties it is from no theoretical scruple or in a playful spirit but out of a craving to see them vanish also out of a desire that they belong to no one once they desert us and we possess none And the truth By what right would others have access to the truth By what injustice would it be revealed to them who are worth less than ourselves Have they striven have they lain awake to deserve it While we labor in vain to attain truth they strut about as if it were set apart for them as if they were endowed with it by some providential decree Yet truth cannot be their appanage and to keep them from laying claim to it we convince them that when they imagine they possess it it is actually a fiction that they grasp In order to salve our own consciences we delight in labeling their bliss nothing but ostentation and arrogance which allows us to disturb them without remorse and by inoculating them with our stupors to make them as vulnerable and wretched as ourselves Skepticism is the sadism of embittered souls The more stress we lay on our torments the more inseparable they seem from our unredeemed condition The maximum detachment to which we can lay claim is a position equidistant from vengeance and from pardon halfway between a resentment and a generosity equally limp and spent since destined to neutralize one another But to slough off the old Adam that we shall never manage even if we were to carry horror of ourselves to the point of forever renouncing any rank at all in the hierarchy of beings Mechanism of Utopia Whenever I happen to be in a city of any size I marvel that riots do not break out every day massacres unspeakable carnage a doomsday chaos How can so many human beings coexist in a space so confined without destroying each other without hating each other to death As a matter of fact they do hate each other but they are not equal to their hatred And it is this mediocrity this impotence that saves society that assures its continuance its stability Occasionally some shock occurs by which our instincts profit but afterward we go on looking each other in the face as if nothing had happened cohabiting without too obviously tearing each other to shreds Order is restored a ferocious calm as dreadful ultimately as the frenzy that had interrupted it Yet I marvel still more that some of us society being what it is have ventured to conceive another one altogether a different society What can be the cause of so much naivete or of so much inanity If the question is normal enough even ordinary the curiosity that led me to ask it on the other hand has the excuse of being morbid Seeking new evidence and just as I despaired of finding anything of the kind it occurred to me to consult utopian literature to steep myself in its masterpieces to wallow in them There to my great delight I sated my pentitential longings my appetite for mortification To spend months recording the dreams of a better future of an ideal society devouring the unreadable what a windfall I hasten to add that this tedious literature has much to teach and that time spent frequenting it is not entirely wasted From the start one discerns in it the fruitful or calamitous role taken in the genesis of events not by happiness but by the idea of happiness an idea that explains the Age of Iron being coextensive with history why each epoch so eagerly invokes the Age of Gold Suppose we put an end to such speculations total stagnation would ensue For we act only under the fascination of the impossible which is to say that a society incapable of generating and of dedicating itself to a utopia is threatened with sclerosis and collapse Wisdom fascinated by nothing recommends an existing a given happiness which man rejects and by this very rejection becomes a historical animal that is a devotee of imagined happiness A new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away we read in Revelations Cross out heaven just keep the new earth and you have the secret and the recipe of all utopian systems for greater precision perhaps you should put city for earth but that is only a detail what counts is the prospect of a new advent the fever of an essential expectation a debased modernized Parousia from which arise those systems so dear to the disinherited Poverty is in fact the utopianist s great auxiliary it is the matter he works in the substance on which he feeds his thoughts the providence of his obsessions Without poverty he would be empty but poverty occupies him allures or embarrasses him depending on whether he is poor or rich from another point of view poverty cannot do without him it needs this theoretician this adept of the future especially since poverty itself that endless meditation on the likelihood of escaping its own present would hardly endure its dreariness without the obsession of another earth Can you doubt it If so it is because you have not tasted utter indigence Do so and you will see that the more destitute you are the more time and energy you will spend in reforming everything in thinking in other words in vain I have in mind not only institutions human creations those of course you will condemn straight off and without appeal but objects all objects however insignificant Unable to accept them as they are you will want to impose your laws and your whims upon them to function at their expense as legislator or as tyrant you will even want to intervene in the life of elements in order to modify their physiognomy their structure Air annoys you let it be transformed And stone as well And the same for the vegetal world the same for man Down past the foundations of being down to the strata of chaos descend install yourself there When you haven t a penny in your pocket you strive you dream how extravagantly you labor to possess All and as long as the frenzy lasts you do possess that All you equal God though no one realizes it not even God not even you The delirium of the poor is the generator of events the source of history a throng of hysterics who want another world here and now It is they who inspire utopias it is for them that utopias are written But utopia let us remember means nowhere And where would these cities be that evil never touches in which labor is blessed and death is never feared There one is constrained to a felicity of geometric idylls of adjusted ecstasies of a thousand disgusting wonders necessarily offered by the spectacle of a perfect world a fabricated world In ludicrous detail Campanella tells us about the Solarians exempt from gout rheumatism catarrh sciatica colic hydropsy flatus    Everything abounds in the City of the Sun because each man is eager to distinguish himself in what he does The leader who presides over each thing is called King    Women and men divided into bands go about their work without ever infringing the orders of their kings and without ever appearing fatigued as we do They regard their leaders as fathers or as older brothers We shall recognize the same twaddle in other works of the genre particularly in those of a Cabet a Fourier or a Morris all lacking in that touch of rancor so necessary to literary works and not only those To conceive a true utopia to sketch with conviction the structure of an ideal society requires a certain dose of ingenuousness even of stupidity which being too evident ultimately exasperates the reader The only readable utopias are the false ones the ones that written in a spirit of entertainment or misanthropy prefigure or recall Gulliver s Travels that Bible of the disabused quintessence of nonchimerical visions a utopia without hope By his sarcasms Swift undeceived a genre to the point of destroying it Is it easier to confect a utopia than an apocalypse Both have their principles and their stereotypes The former whose cliches are closer to our deepest instincts has given rise to a much more abundant literature than the latter Not everyone can reckon with a cosmic catastrophe or love the language and the style with which it is heralded and proclaimed But he who acknowledges and applauds such an idea will read in the Gospels with all the enthusiasm of vice the figures and banalities that will prosper on Patmos The stars of heaven shall fall unto the earth and the moon become as blood    all the tribes of the earth shall lament    nor shall this generation perish before all these things are come to pass This presentiment of the incredible of a capital event this crucial expectation can turn into an illusion which will be the hope of a paradise on earth or elsewhere or else it can turn into anxiety and this will be the vision of an ideal Worst a voluptuously dreaded cataclysm And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that with it he should smite the nations Conventions of horror routine procedures Saint John had to go in for them once he opted for that splendid gibberish that procession of downfalls preferable all things considered to the descriptions of cities and islands where you are smothered by an impersonal bliss where universal harmony crushes you in its embrace The dreams of utopia have for the most part been realized but in an entirely different spirit from the one in which they had been conceived what was perfection for utopia is for us a flaw its chimeras are our disasters The type of society conceived by utopia in a lyrical tonality seems to us in operation intolerable Judge from the following sample of Cabet s Voyage en Icarie Twothousand fivehundred young women dressmakers work in a factory some sitting some standing almost all charming    The rule that each worker produces the same object doubles the rapidity of the manufacture and brings it to perfection as well Thousands of items of the most elegant headware are created each morning by the hands of these lovely workers Such lucubrations proceed from mental debility or bad taste And yet Cabet has in material terms seen quite accurately he is mistaken only with regard to the essential Utterly uninstructed as to the interval that separates being and producing we exist in the full sense of the word only outside of what we do only beyond our actions  he could not discern the fatality attached to every form of labor artisanal industrial or otherwise What is most striking in utopian narratives is the absence of perspicacity of psychological instinct Their characters are automatons fictions or symbols none is real none exceeds its puppet status an idea lost in a universe without reference points Even the children become unrecognizable In Fourier s societary state they are so pure that they are utterly unaware of the temptation to steal to pick an apple off a tree But a child who does not steal is not a child What is the use of creating a society of marionettes I recommend the description of the phalanstery as the most effective vomitive I know Placed at the antipodes of a La Rochefoucauld the inventor of utopias is a moralist who perceives in us only disinterest craving for sacrifice selfeffacement Bloodless perfect and nil thunderstruck by Good stripped of sins and vices with neither depth nor contour utterly uninitiated into existence into the art of embarrassment of varying one s shames and torments such men never suspect the pleasure that our neighbor s despair provokes in us the impatience with which we anticipate and follow his downfall This impatience and this pleasure can on occasion proceed from a proper curiosity with nothing diabolical about it As long as someone rises in the world we do not know who he is for his ascent distancing him from himself he lacks reality he does not exist Similarly we know ourselves only from the moment when we begin to fail when any success on the level of human interests turns out to be impossible a perspicuous defeat by which taking possession of our own being we stand apart from the universal torpor The better to grasp your own collapse or another s you must pass through evil and if need be plunge deep within it how manage this in those islands and cities from which it is excluded by principle by raison d etat Here all shadows are forbidden only light is admitted No trace of dualism utopia is by essence antiManichean Hostile to anomaly to deformity to irregularity it tends to the affirmation of the homogeneous of the typical of repetition and orthodoxy But life is rupture heresy derogation from the norms of matter And man in relation to life is heresy to the second degree victory of the individual of whim aberrant apparition a schismatic animal that society the totality of sleeping monsters seeks to recall to the straight and narrow path Heretic par excellence the wakened monster an incarnate solitude infraction of the universal order delights in his exception isolates himself in his onerous privileges and it is in duration that he pays for what he gains over his kind the more he distinguishes himself from them the more dangerous and simultaneously the more fragile he will be for it is at the cost of his longevity that he disturbs the others peace and that he creates for himself there in the heart of the city an undesirable standing Our hopes for the future state of the human race can be reduced to these three important points the destruction of inequality among nations the progress of equality within one and the same people and finally the perfecting of humanity Condorcet Committed to the description of real cities history which always and everywhere asseverates the failure rather than the fulfillment of our hopes has ratified none of these forecasts For a Tactitus there is no ideal Rome By banishing the irrational and the irreparable utopia further sets itself against tragedy paroxysm and quintessence of history In a perfect city all conflict would cease human wills would be throttled mollified or rendered miraculously convergent here would reign only unity without the ingredient of chance or contradiction Utopia is a mixture of childish rationalism and secularized angelism We are submerged in evil Not that all our actions are bad but when we happen to commit good ones we suffer from them for having thwarted our spontaneous impulses the practice of virtue comes down to an exercise of penitence an apprenticeship to maceration Fallen angel transformed into a demiurge assigned to Creation Satan rebels against God and reveals himself here below more at ease and even more powerful than He far from being a usurper he is our master a legitimate sovereign who would prevail over the Most High if the universe were reduced to man So let us have the courage to acknowledge whom we are responsible to The great religions have not been deceived what Mara offers to Buddha Ahriman to Zoroaster the Tempter to Jesus is the earth and supremacy over the earth realities well within the power of the Prince of this world And we are playing his game cooperating in his enterprise and fulfilling it when we seek to establish a new realm a generalized utopia or a universal empire for what he craves above all is that we embroil ourselves with him and that upon his contact we turn away from the light from the regret for our old felicity Closed for five thousand years paradise was reopened according to Saint John Chrysostom at the moment when Christ expired the thief could enter it now followed by Adam repatriated at last and by a limited number of the Just who were vegetating in the infernal regions waiting for the hour of redemption Everything suggests that paradise has been bolted shut again and that it will remain so for a long time to come No one can force an entrance there the few privileged characters enjoying the place have doubtless barricaded themselves inside according to a system whose wonders they could observe on earth This paradise has a look of being the real one in the depths of our prostrations we dream of it and in it long to dissolve A sudden impulse leads us to it and we plunge in do we seek to regain in a moment what we have lost forever suddenly to make up for the sin of being born Nothing shows more clearly the metaphysical meaning of our nostalgia than its incapacity to coincide with any moment of time whatever hence it seeks consolation in a remote immemorial past refractory to the centuries and somehow anterior to becoming The evil from which our nostalgia suffers effect of a rupture that dates back to the beginnings keeps it from projecting the Age of Gold into the future the golden age it conceives quite naturally is the old one the primordial one to which it aspires less for pleasure s sake than to swoon there to lay down the burden of consciousness If we return to the source of all seasons of time itself it is to rediscover the true paradise there object of all our regrets On the other hand the nostalgia from which the earthly paradise derives will be minus precisely the dimension of regret a nostalgia reversed falsified and vitiated straining toward the future obnubilated by progress a temporal rejoinder a jeering metamorphosis of the original paradise Contagion Automatism This metamorphosis has ultimately come to pass within each of us Willynilly we bet on the future make it into a panacea and identifying it with the appearance of an altogether different time within time we consider it as an inexhaustible and yet completed duration a timeless history A contradiction in terms inherent in the hope of a new kingdom of a victory of the unsolvable at the heart of becoming Our dreams of a better world are based on a theoretical impossibility Hardly surprising if in order to justify them we must resort to solid paradoxes As long as Christianity satisfied men s minds utopia could not seduce them once Christianity began to disappoint them utopia sought to conquer them and to establish itself there It was already hard at work during the Renaissance but was not to succeed until two centuries later in an age of enlightened superstitions Thus was born the Future vision of an irrevocable happiness of a maneuvered paradise in which chance has no place in which the merest fantasy seems like a heresy or a provocation To describe such a thing would be to enter into the details of the unimaginable The very notion of an ideal city is a torment to reason an enterprise that does honor to the heart and disqualifies the intellect How could a Plato condescend to such a thing He is the ancestor I was forgetting of all these aberrations revived and aggravated by Thomas More the founder of modern illusions To construct a society where according to a terrifying ceremony our acts are catalogued and regulated where by a charity carried to the point of indecency our innermost thoughts are inspected is to transfer the pangs of hell to the Age of Gold or to create with the devil s help a philanthropic institution Solarians Utopians Harmonians their hideous names resemble their fate a nightmare promised to us as well since we ourselves have erected it into an ideal In preaching the advantages of labor utopias would take the opposite tack from Genesis On this point especially they are the expression of a humanity engulfed in toil proud of conniving with the consequences of the Fall of which the gravest remains the obsession with profit The stigmata of a race that cherishes the sweat of the brow and makes it a sign of nobility that labors exultantly these we bear with pride and ostentation whence the horror inspired in us reprobates as we are by the elect who refuse to toil or to excel in any realm whatever The refusal we reproach them for is one that only the man who preserves the memory of an immemorial happiness is capable of Alienated among his kind he is like them and yet cannot communicate with them whichever way he looks he does not feel he is from hereabouts whatever he discerns seems to him a usurpation the very fact of bearing a name    His enterprises fail he ventures upon them without believing in them simulacra from which the precise image of another world alienates him Man once expelled from paradise in order not to think about it anymore in order not to suffer from it is given in compensation the faculty of will of aspiring to action of foundering there with enthusiasm with brio    But the abulic in his detachment in his supernatural marasmus what effort can he make to what goal can he abandon himself Nothing induces him to emerge from his    absence And yet he himself does not entirely escape the common curse he exhausts himself in a regret and expends on it more energy than we deploy in all our exploits When Christ promised that the kingdom of God was neither here nor there but within us he doomed in advance the utopian constructions for which any kingdom is necessarily exterior with no relation to our inmost self or our individual salvation So deeply have utopias marked us that it is from outside from the course of events or from the progress of collectivities that we await our deliverance Thus was devised the Meaning of history whose vogue would supplant that of Progress without adding anything new to it Yet it was necessary to shelve not a concept but one of its verbal translations which had been abused In ideological matters we are not easily renewed without the help of synonyms Various as are its disguises the notion of perfectibility has made its way into our manners to it subscribes even the man who questions it That history just unfolds independently of a specified direction of a goal no one is willing to admit A Goal surely it has one races toward it has all but reached it proclaim our doctrines and our desires The more heavily an idea is burdened with immediate promises the greater likelihood it has of triumphing Unable to find the kingdom of God within themselves or rather too cunning to want to seek it there Christians placed it in the course of events in becoming they perverted a teaching in order to ensure its success Furthermore Christ himself sustained the ambiguity on one hand answering the insinuations of the Pharisees he recommended an interior kingdom remote from time and on the other he signified to his disciples that salvation being imminent they and the present generation would witness the consummation of all things Having understood that human beings accept martyrdom for a chimera but not for a truth he came to terms with their weakness Had he acted otherwise he would have compromised his work But what in him was concession or tactic is in the utopianists postulate or passion A great step forward was made the day men understood that in order to torment one another more effectively they would have to gather together to organize themselves into a society If we are to believe the utopias they succeeded in doing so only by halves the utopias therefore offer to help them to furnish them a context appropriate to the exercise of a complete happiness while requiring in return that men abdicate their freedom or if they retain it that they use it solely to proclaim their joy amid the sufferings they inflict upon each other Such seems the meaning of the infernal solicitude the utopias show toward men Under these conditions how can we fail to envisage a reverse utopia a liquidation of the infinitesimal good and the enormous evil attached to the existence of any social order whatever The project is alluring the temptation irresistible How put an end to so vast an amount of anomalies It would require something comparable to the universal dissolvent sought by the alchemists and whose efficacy would be tested not on metals but on institutions Until the formula is found let us note in passing that in their positive aspects alchemy and utopia coincide pursuing in heterogeneous realms a dream of transmutation that is related if not identical one attacks the irreducible in nature the other the irreducible in history And it is from one and the same spiritual vice or from one and the same hope that the elixir of life and the ideal city derive Just as a nation in order to set itself apart from the others in order to humiliate and overwhelm them or simply in order to acquire a unique physiognomy needs an extravagant idea to guide it to propose goals incommensurable with its real capacities so a society evolves and asserts itself only if ideals are suggested to it or inculcated in it out of all proportion to what it is Utopia fulfills in the life of collectivities the function assigned to the notion of mission in the life of peoples Hence ideologies are the byproduct and in a sense the vulgar expression of messianic or utopian visions In itself an ideology is neither good nor bad Everything depends on the moment when it is adopted Communism for example acts upon a virile nation like a stimulant it impels it onward and favors its expansion on a tottering nation its influence may be less happy Neither true nor false it precipitates matters and it is not because of it but through it that Russia acquired its present vigor Would it play the same part once established throughout the rest of Europe Would it be a principle of renewal One would like to hope so in any case the question admits of only an indirect an arbitrary answer inspired by analogies of a historical order Let us reflect upon the effects of Christianity at its beginnings it delivered a fatal blow to ancient society paralyzed it finished it off on the other hand it was a blessing to the Barbarians whose instincts were enhanced upon contact Far from regenerating a decrepit world it regenerated only the regenerated In the same fashion communism will bring about in the immediate future the salvation of only those who are already saved it cannot provide a concrete hope to the moribund still less can it reanimate corpses After having denounced the absurdities of utopia let us deal with its merits and since men accommodate social arrangements so well and scarcely distinguish from them the evils immanent within them let us do as they do let us unite ourselves with their unconsciousness We shall never praise the utopias sufficiently for having denounced the crimes of ownership the horror property represents the calamities it causes Great or small the owner is corrupted sullied in his essence his corruption is projected onto the merest object he touches or appropriates Whether his fortune is threatened or stripped from him he will be compelled to a consciousness of which he is normally incapable In order to reassume a human appearance in order to regain his soul he must be ruined and must consent to his ruin In this the revolution will help him By restoring him to his primal nakedness it annihilates him in the immediate future and saves him in the absolute for it liberates inwardly it is understood those whom it strikes first the haves it reclassifies them it restores to them their former dimension and leads them back to the values they have betrayed But even before having the means or the occasion to strike them the revolution sustains in them a salutary fear it troubles their sleep nourishes their nightmares and nightmare is the beginning of a metaphysical awakening Hence it is as an agent of destruction that the revolution is seen to be useful however deadly one thing always redeems it it alone knows what kind of terror to use in order to shake up this world of owners the crudest of all possible worlds Every form of possession let us not hesitate to insist degrades debases flatters the monster sleeping deep within each of us To own even a broom to count anything at all as our property is to participate in the general infamy What pride to discover that nothing belongs to you what a revelation You took yourself for the last of men and now suddenly astonished and virtually enlightened by your destitution you no longer suffer from it quite the contrary you pride yourself in it And all you still desire is to be as indigent as a saint or a madman When we are exasperated by traditional values we necessarily orient ourselves toward the ideology that denies them And it is by its force of negation that utopia seduces much more than by its positive formulas To desire the overthrow of the social order is to pass through a crisis more or less marked by communist themes This is true today as it was true yesterday and will be true even tomorrow Everything suggests that since the Renaissance men s minds have been attracted on the surface by liberalism and in depth by communism which far from being a product of circumstances a historical accident is the heir of utopian systems and the beneficiary of a long subterranean labor initially a caprice or a schism it was ultimately to assume the character of a destiny and an orthodoxy At the present time our consciousness can waken to only two forms of revolt communist and anticommunist Yet how can we fail to realize that anticommunism is equivalent to a furious horrified faith in the future of communism When an ideology s moment has come everything contributes to its success even its enemies neither polemics nor police can check its expansion or delay its success it seeks and it is able to realize itself to incarnate itself but the better it succeeds the greater risk it runs of exhausting itself once established it will be drained of its ideal content will extenuate its resources compromising the promises of salvation it possessed only to degenerate at the end into a bugbear or humbug The career reserved for communism depends on the rate at which it expends its utopian reserves So long as it possesses them it will inevitably tempt all societies that have not experienced such a thing retreating here advancing there invested with virtues no other ideology possesses it will circle the earth replacing defunct or declining religions and everywhere offering the modern crowd an absolute worthy of its nothingness Considered in itself communism appears as the only reality to which one might still subscribe if one harbors even a wisp of illusion as to the future this is why to various degrees we are all communists    But is it not a sterile speculation to judge a doctrine apart from the anomalies inherent in its practical realization Man will always anticipate the advent of justice for justice to triumph he will renounce freedom which he will afterward regret Whatever he undertakes this impasse haunts his actions and his thoughts as if it were not its final term but its point of departure its condition and its key No new social form is in a position to safeguard the advantages of the old a virtually equal amount of disadvantages is encountered in all types of society A cursed equilibrium an irremediable stagnation from which individuals and collectivities suffer alike Theories can do nothing about it the depths of history being impermeable to the doctrines that mark its appearance The Christian era was quite a different thing from Christianity the communist era in its turn cannot evoke communism as such There exists no event that is naturally Christian or naturally communist If utopia was illusion hypostasized communism going still further will be illusion decreed imposed a challenge to the omnipresence of evil an obligatory optimism A man will find it hard to accommodate himself to it if he lives by dint of ordeals and experiments in the intoxication of disappointment and if like the author of Genesis he is reluctant to identify the Age of Gold with the future with becoming Not that he scorns the fanatics of infinite progress and their efforts to make justice prevail here on earth but he knows to his misery that justice is a material impossibility a grandiose meaninglessness the only ideal about which we can declare quite certainly that it will never be realized and against which nature and society seem to have mobilized all their laws These factions these conflicts are not uniquely those of a solitary With more or less intensity we too endure them all the rest of us are we not at the point of longing for the destruction of this very society even while knowing the misadventures reserved for us by the one that will replace it A total overthrow however useless a revolution without faith is all we can still hope for from a period in which no one is sufficiently honest to be a true revolutionary When tormented by the frenzy of the intellect we give ourselves up to that of chaos we react like a madman in possession of his faculties a lunatic superior to his lunacy or like a god who in a fit of lucid rage delights in pulverizing his work and his being Our dreams of the future are henceforth inseparable from our fears Utopian literature at its beginnings rebelled against the Middle Ages against the high esteem in which they held Hell and against the taste they professed for doomsday visions It seems as if the reassuring systems of a Campanella or a More were conceived with the sole purpose of discrediting the hallucinations of a Saint Hildegarde Today reconciled with the terrible we are seeing a contamination of utopia by apocalypse the heralded new earth increasingly assumes the aspect of a new Hell But this Hell is one we are waiting for we even make it a duty to precipitate its advent The two genres utopian and apocalyptic which once seemed so dissimilar to us interpenetrate rub off on each other to form a third wonderfully apt to reflect the kind of reality that threatens us and to which we shall nonetheless assent with a correct and disabused yes That will be our way of being irreproachable in the face of fatality The Golden Age I In those days men lived like gods free of care knowing neither labor nor pain Old age and its miseries never visited them and retaining the strength of their hands and limbs as long as they lived they feasted in delight shielded from all harm Men died as if they fell asleep overcome by no more than drowsiness Every good was theirs the fertile land afforded plentiful nourishment of itself and men ate and drank at their pleasure    Hesiod s portrait of the golden age matches that of the biblical Eden One is as conventional as the other unreality cannot be dramatic At least they share the merit of defining the image of a static world where identity ceaselessly contemplates itself ruled by an eternal present that tense common to all visions of paradise a time forged in opposition to the very idea of time In order to conceive and aspire to it we must execrate all becoming having endured its weight its calamity we must long to wrest ourselves free of it at any cost This longing is the only one a feeble will is capable of a will eager to rest to dissolve    elsewhere Had we adhered without reservation to the eternal present history would not have occurred or in any case would not have been synonymous with burden with torment When it weighs too heavily upon us when it overwhelms us a nameless cowardice seizes upon our being the prospect of further struggles among the centuries assumes nightmare proportions The accommodations of that mythological age allure us then to the point of pain or if we have frequented Genesis the divagations of regret transplant us into the happy stupors of the first garden while our mind evokes the angels and turns itself inside out to penetrate their secret The more we think about them the higher they rise out of our lassitude not without some advantage to ourselves do they not permit us to appreciate the degree of our inaptitude for the world of our awkwardness in getting ourselves into it However impalpable however unreal they may be yet they are less so than we who brood upon them and invoke them shadows or counterfeit shadows desiccated flesh annihilated breath And it is with all our wretchedness as oppressed ghosts that we ponder them beseeching    There is nothing terrible in their nature as a certain elegy claims no what is terrible is to have reached the point of being able to deal with nothing but them or when we suppose them a thousand miles away from us suddenly to see them emerging from the twilight of our own flesh and blood II As for the sources of life which the gods according to Hesiod again have hidden from us it was Prometheus who took it upon himself to reveal them Responsible for all our misfortunes he was quite unaware of being so though he prided himself in his lucidity The remarks Aeschylus puts in his mouth are word for word the contrary of those we have just read in Works and Days In those days men saw but saw badly they listened but failed to understand    They took action but never realized what they were doing We recognize the tone no use quoting any further What Prometheus reproached men for after all was their plunge into the primordial idyll their conformity to the laws of their nature unbroached by consciousness By wakening them to mind by separating them from those sources they had previously enjoyed without attempting to sound their depths or their significance he brought them not happiness but the curse and the torments of titanism They were doing very well without consciousness he came to inflict it upon them to nail them to it and consciousness provoked within them a drama which extends to each of us and will end only with the race itself With every passing day consciousness gains a greater hold over us dominates us tears us away from life we try clinging to life anew and failing turn against life and consciousness both then we weigh their meaning and their donnees until exasperated we turn against ourselves This he had not anticipated our deadly philanthropist whose sole excuse was illusion a tempter in spite of himself a feckless and blundering serpent Men listened what need did they have to understand Prometheus obliged them to do so handing them over to becoming to history in other words driving them out of the eternal present Innocent or guilty what does it matter Prometheus deserved his punishment The first zealot of science a modern in the worst sense of the word his heroics and his ravings herald those of many a doctrinaire of the last century only his sufferings console us for so many extravagances Now that eagle there is someone who understood and who divining our future sought to spare us its horrors But the machine had been started men had already acquired a taste for the wiles of the seducer who modeling them in his own image taught them to rummage like himself in the underside of life despite the prohibition of the gods Prometheus is the instigator of all the indiscretions and misdemeanors of knowledge the source of that murderous curiosity which keeps us from marrying the world by idealizing knowledge and action did he not thereby ruin Being and with Being the possibility of the golden age The tribulations to which he doomed us if not equal to his would nonetheless last longer His program coherent as fatality he realized to perfection only in reverse everything he preached to us everything he imposed upon us has turned point by point first against him then against us One does not shake off original unconsciousness with impunity those who following his lead cast aspersions upon it inexorably suffer his fate they are devoured they too have their rock and their eagle And the hatred with which they thank him is all the more virulent in that they hate themselves in him III The transition of the silver age then to that of bronze and of iron marks the progress of our downfall of our alienation from that eternal present of which we conceive no more than a simulacrum and with which we have ceased to have a common frontier it belongs to another universe it eludes us and we are so distinct from it that we barely succeed in suspecting its nature No way of appropriating it did we ever really possess it And how regain our footing there when nothing restores its image in us for us We are forever thwarted and if we ever do approach it the merit of our success goes to those extremities of satiety and sluggishness wherein it is however no more than a caricature of itself a parody of the immutable a prostrate becoming frozen in a timeless avarice huddled over a sterile moment over a treasure which impoverishes it a spectral becoming powerless and yet fulfilled stuffed as it is with the void For beings to whom ecstasy was forbidden no glimpse of origin save by the extinction of their vitality by the absence of any attribute by that sensation of hollow infinity of a cheapened abyss of inflated space and of a suppliant spoiled duration There is an authentic positive eternity which extends beyond time there is another one negative and false located within it that eternity in which we stagnate far from salvation outside the competence of any redeemer and which liberates us from everything by depriving us of everything The universe impoverished we exhaust ourselves in the spectacle of our own appearances Has it atrophied then the organ that once allowed us to perceive the depths of our being And are we forever reduced to our semblances When a list is someday made of all the ills the flesh and spirit are heir to they will still be as nothing to the one that comes from our incapacity to marry ourselves to the eternal present or to steal from it for our delight even the tiniest fraction Fallen without recourse into a negative eternity into that scattered time which affirms itself only by annulling itself an essence reduced to a series of destructions a summa of ambiguities a plenitude whose principle abides in the void we live and die in each of its moments without knowing when it is for in truth it never is For all its precariousness we are so attached to it that in order to tear ourselves from it we require more than an eruption of our habits a lesion of the mind a crack in the self through which we might glimpse the indestructible and gain access to it a favor granted only to certain reprobates in recompense for their assent to their own destruction The rest the great majority of mortals while avowing their incapacity for such a sacrifice never renounce the quest for another time they devote themselves to it on the contrary with desperation but locate it here on earth according to the prescriptions of utopia which seek to reconcile the eternal present with history the delights of the golden age with Promethean ambitions or to resort to biblical terminology to remake Eden with the instruments of the Fall thereby permitting the new Adam to know the advantages of the old one Is this not to attempt to revise the Creation IV Vico s notion of constructing an ideal history and of tracing its eternal circle is recognizable applied to society in the utopian systems characterized by their effort to solve the social question once and for all Whence their obsession with the definitive and their impatience to institute paradise as soon as possible in the immediate future a kind of stationary duration an immobilized Possible a counterfeit of the eternal present If I prophesy says Fourier so unhesitatingly the universal harmony as an imminent phenomenon it is because the organization of the societary state requires no more than two years    A naive avowal if ever there was one which betrays nonetheless a profound reality Would we fling ourselves into even the flimsiest enterprise without the secret conviction that the absolute depends upon us our ideas our actions and that we can guarantee their triumph in a short period of time Any man who identifies himself completely with something behaves as if he were anticipating the advent of the universal harmony or considered himself its promoter To act is to anchor in an imminent future so imminent it becomes almost tangible to act is to feel you are consubstantial with that future Which is not the case for those persecuted by the demon of procrastination What can be usefully postponed can be even more usefully abandoned they repeat with Epictetus though their passion for postponement does not proceed as it does for the Stoic from any moral consideration but from an almost methodical dread and from a disgust too inveterate not to assume the qualities of a discipline or a vice If they have proscribed the before and the after evacuated today and tomorrow as equally uninhabitable it is because it is easier for them to live in imagination ten thousand years hence than to loll in the immediate and the imminent With the years they will have thought more about timeinitself than time passing more about the indefinite than the effective more about the end of the world than the end of a day Knowing duration neither in the extent of moments nor in privileged sites they move from failure to failure and when even this progress is prohibited they stop look in every direction question the horizon there is no more horizon    And that is when they experience not vertigo but panic a panic so powerful that it erases their steps and prevents them from escaping They are men excluded banished men outlawed from time disjointed from the rhythm that sweeps on the mob men victimized by an anemic and lucid will struggling with itself endlessly listening to itself To will in the fullest sense of the word is to be unaware that one wills is to refuse to loiter over the phenomenon of the will The man of action weighs neither his impulses nor his motives still less does he consult his reflexes he obeys them without reflecting upon them and without hampering them It is not action in itself that interests him but its goal its intention similarly the object will attract him and not the mechanism of the will At grips with the world he seeks what is definitive in it or hopes to put it there himself right now or in two years   To manifest oneself is to let oneself be blinded by some form or other of perfection not even movement as such fails to contain a utopian ingredient Even to breathe would be a torture without the memory or anticipation of paradise supreme and yet unconscious object of our desires unformulated essence of our memory and our expectation Incapable of divulging it in the subsoil of their nature too hurried as well to be able to dig it out we moderns must project it into the future and the epigraph of the SaintSimonian journal Le Producteur represents the shortcut of all our illusions The golden age which a blind tradition located in the past lies before us Hence we are eager to hasten its advent to institute it for eternity according to an eschatology deriving not from anxiety but from exaltation and euphoria from a suspect and almost morbid greed for happiness The revolutionary thinks that the overthrow he is preparing will be the last all of us think the same thing in the sphere of our activities the ultimate is the obsession of the living We bestir ourselves because it is up to us we think to complete history to close it because it appears to us as our domain as does truth itself emerging at last from its chaste reserve to reveal itself Error will be the fate of others only we shall have understood everything Victor over his kind then over God seeking to revise His work to correct its imperfections anyone who has not tried as much who does not believe it is his duty to try renounces his own destiny whether out of wisdom or weakness Prometheus sought to do better than Zeus improvised demiurges each of us tries to do better than God to inflict upon Him the humiliation of a paradise superior to His to suppress the irreparable to defatalize the world borrowing a word from Proudhon s jargon In its general outline utopia is a cosmogonie dream on the level of history V We shall not build paradise here on earth so long as men are marked by Sin hence we must release them from it liberate them The systems that have been committed to doing so participate in a more or less disguised Pelagianism Pelagius a Celt a naif  by denying the effects of the Fall deprived Adam s lie of any power to affect posterity Our first ancestor lived a strictly personal drama incurred a disgrace that regarded him alone without in any way knowing the pleasure of bequeathing to us his flaws and misfortunes Born good and free there is in us no trace of an original corruption It is hard to imagine a doctrine more generous and more untrue this is a heresy of the utopian type fruitful by its very extravagances by its absurdities which were rich in futures Not that the authors of utopias took their inspiration from it directly but it is incontestable that in modern thought there exists hostile to Augustinianism and to Jansenism an authentic current of Pelagianism the idolatry of progress and all revolutionary ideologies will be its conclusion according to which we constitute a mass of the virtual elect emancipated from original sin infinitely malleable predestined to the good capable of any and every perfection Robert Owen s manifesto promises us a system capable of creating a new spirit and a new will in the entire human race and thereby to lead each man by an irresistible necessity to become consistent rational healthy in judgment and in conduct Pelagius like his remote disciples starts from a fiercely optimistic vision of our nature But there is no proof of any kind that the will is good it is even certain that it is anything but the new will equally with the old Only men with a deficient will are spontaneously good the others must apply themselves to being so and succeed only at the cost of efforts that embitter them Evil being inseparable from action the consequence is that our undertakings are necessarily directed against someone or something at the limit against ourselves But usually I must insist we will only at someone else s expense Far from being more or less elect we are more or less reprobates If you want to construct a society in which men do no harm to one another you must admit only abulics What we have is more than the choice between a sick will and a bad one the former excellent because stricken immobilized ineffectual the latter noxious and hence active invested by a dynamic principle the very one that sustains the fever of becoming and provokes events Take it away from man if you want a golden age Which would be as much as to strip him of his very being whose entire secret resides in that propensity to do harm without which he is inconceivable Resistant to his own happiness and to that of others he acts as if he longed for the institution of an ideal society if it were achieved he would smother in it the disadvantages of satiety being incomparably greater than those of poverty He loves tension perpetual advance toward what would make his way within perfection Unfit for the eternal present he dreads moreover its monotony that reef of paradise in its double form religious and utopian Isn t history ultimately the result of our fear of boredom of that fear which will always make us cherish the novelty and the spice of disaster and prefer any misfortune to stagnation An obsession with the unheardof is the destructive principle of our salvation We head for hell to the degree that we leave the vegetative life behind that life whose passivity would constitute the key to everything the supreme answer to all our questions the horror it inspires in us has made us into that horde of civilized men of omniscient monsters who know nothing of the essential To be bored in slow motion to endure with dignity the injustice of Being to wrest ourselves away from expectation from the oppression of hope to seek a middle term between breathing and the corpse we are all too corrupted and too winded for that There is no help for it nothing will reconcile us with boredom Were we less rebellious to its sway we should know by some succor from on high a plenitude without events the pleasure of the invariable instant the delectation of identity But such a grace is so contrary to our nature that we are only too happy not to receive it Riven to diversity we mine it for that constant quantity of excesses and conflicts so necessary to our instincts Released from care and from all shackles we should be delivered to ourselves the vertigo we would suffer then would leave us a thousand times worse off than our servitude does This aspect of our failure escaped the anarchists the last Pelagians to date who nonetheless were superior to their predecessors in that they rejected in their cult of freedom every city beginning with the ideal ones and substituted for them a new variety of chimeras more brilliant and more improbable than the old If they raged against the State and demanded its suppression it was because they saw it as an obstacle to the exercise of a will that was fundamentally good now it is precisely because the will is bad is wicked that the State was born if the State were to vanish the will would give itself up to evil without any restriction whatever Nonetheless the anarchists idea of annihilating all authority remains one of the finest ever conceived And we can never sufficiently deplore the fact that the race of those who sought to realize it is now extinct But perhaps they had to fade to absent themselves from an age like ours so eager to invalidate their theories and their prophecies They heralded the era of the individual the individual is drawing to his close they proclaimed the eclipse of the State the State was never stronger or more oppressive they hailed the age of equality it is the age of terror which has come Everything runs down Compared to theirs even our crimes have deteriorated in quality those we now and then still deign to commit lack that atmosphere of the absolute which redeemed theirs always executed with so much care and so much brio Is there anyone today willing to throw bombs for the establishment of the universal harmony a capital fiction from which we no longer expect anything at all Besides what could we hope from it at the end of the iron age we have come to The prevailing sentiment now is disillusion the summa of our tainted dreams And if we have not even the resource of believing in the virtues of destruction it is because we are all secularized anarchists today and have understood not only their urgency but also their uselessness VI Suffering in its early stages counts on the golden age here on earth seeks a basis for it attaches itself to it in a sense but as suffering intensifies it withdraws attached only to itself Once an accomplice of utopian systems it now rises against them discerning in them a mortal danger to the preservation of its own pangs whose charms it has just discovered With the voice of Dostoevsky s Notes from Underground it will plead in favor of chaos rise up against reason against two and two equals four against the crystal palace that replica of the phalanstery He who has glimpsed the inferno with its hierarchy of woes will recognize its terrible symmetry in the ideal city universal happiness repugnant to anyone who has suffered greatly Dostoevsky vented his hostility to utopia to the point of intolerance As he grew older he was to define himself increasingly by an opposition to the Fourierist notion of his youth unable to forgive himself for having subscribed to them he took his revenge upon his own heroes superhuman    caricatures of his first illusions What he loathed in them were his former divagations the concessions he had granted to utopia many of whose themes were to pursue him nonetheless when with the Grand Inquisitor he divides humanity into a happy herd and a ravaged clearsighted minority which assumes the destinies of the others or when with Verkhovensky he tries to make Stavrogin into the spiritual leader of the future city an atheist and revolutionary sovereign pontiff the novelist takes his inspiration from the priesthood the SaintSimonians set above the producers or from Enfantin s plan to make SaintSimon himself the pope of the new religion Dostoevsky links Catholicism to socialism he even identifies them in a perspective that partakes of method and madness equally an eminently Slav melange In relation to the West everything in Russia is heightened one degree skepticism becomes nihilism hypothesis dogma idea icon Shigalev utters no more lunacies than say Cabet only he goes about it with an intensity not to be found in his French model You have no obsessions left only we have any now the Russians seem to be telling the West through Dostoevsky that obsessive par excellence partisan like all his characters of a single dream the dream of the golden age without which he assures us peoples have no will to live and cannot even die He himself does not expect its realization in history on the contrary he dreads its advent though without going over to the reaction for he attacks progress in the name not of order but of whim of the right to caprice After having rejected the paradise to come will he save the other one the old the immemorial one He will make it the subject of a dream he attributes successively to Stavrogin to Versilov and to the ridiculous man In the Dresden Gallery there is a painting by Claude Lorrain listed in the catalogue under the title Acts and Galatea    It was this picture that I saw in my dream but not as a picture as a reality There was a landscape from the Greek archipelago just as in the painting and I seemed to have moved back in time some three thousand years Blue waves gently lapping rocks and islets blossoming shores and in the distance an enchanting panorama the lure of the setting sun    Here was the cradle of humanity    Men woke and fell asleep happy and innocent the woods rang with their joyous songs and they expended their abundant powers in making love in simple pleasures All this I experienced even as I discerned the enormous future which lay ahead of them and whose very existence they did not suspect and my heart shuddered at such thoughts The Possessed Versilov in his turn will dream the same dream as Stavrogin though with this difference that the setting sun will suddenly appear to him no longer as that of the beginning but as that of the end of European humanity In A Raw Youth this picture is somewhat darkened and altogether darkened in The Dream of a Ridiculous Man The golden age and its cliches are presented here with more exactitude and spirit than in the two preceding dreams a vision of Claude Lorrain annotated by a Sarmatian Hesiod We are on the earth before it was tainted by original sin Men lived there in a kind of amorous fervor universal and reciprocal having children but without knowing the horrors of eroticism and childbirth wandering through the woods singing hymns and plunged in a perpetual ecstasy knowing nothing of jealousy anger sickness and so on All of which still sounds conventional enough Fortunately for us their bliss which seemed eternal was when put to the test precarious enough the ridiculous man came among them and perverted them all With the appearance of evil the cliches vanish the picture grows livelier Like a contagious disease an atom of plague capable of contaminating a whole empire even so I contaminated by my presence a blissful land innocent until my advent They learned to lie and delighted in deceit they learned the beauty of mendacity Perhaps all this began quite innocently playfully teasingly as if it were a kind of game and in fact perhaps by means of some atom but this atom of lying made its way into their hearts and they found it good even lovable Soon after voluptuous pleasure was born and in turn engendered jealousy and jealousy cruelty    Oh I don t know I don t remember any more but soon quickly enough blood was shed in its first jets and splashes they were amazed frightened and they began to avoid one another to separate Alliances were formed but now they were directed against the others Reproaches and castigations were heard They learned what shame is and of shame they made a virtue The sense of honor was born among them and brandished its flag over each alliance They began to mistreat the animals and the animals left them for the depths of the forests where they lived hostile to mankind An age of struggles began favoring separatism individualism personality and the distinction of mine and thine There came to pass a diversity of languages Men learned sadness and learned even to love it they aspired to suffering and said that the truth was to be had by suffering alone Having become wicked it was then that they began to speak of brotherhood and humanity and that they understood such ideas Having become criminal it was then that they invented justice and handed down codes of law in order to preserve it then in order to insure respect for these codes they instituted the guillotine They had no more than a faint memory of what they had lost they would not even believe that once they had been innocent and happy They never tired of deriding the possibility of their former happiness which they called a dream See A Writer s Diary But there is worse they were to discover that consciousness of life is superior to life and the knowledge of the laws of happiness superior to happiness Henceforth they were lost by dividing men against themselves by the demoniac work of science by casting them out of the eternal present and into history had not the ridiculous man reinvented for them the errors and follies of Prometheus His crime perpetrated he begins preaching at the instigation of remorse a crusade for the reconquest of this world of delights he has just destroyed He commits himself to it but without conviction Nor is the author convinced either at least such is our impression having rejected the formulas of the Future he turns toward his preferred obsession toward the ageold felicity only to expose its inconsistency and its phantasmagoria Horrified by his discovery he will try to attenuate its effects to revive his illusions to save if only ideally his dearest dream He will not succeed as he knows just as we know and we do injustice to his thought by declaring that it concludes with the double impossibility of paradise Moreover is it not revealing that in order to describe the idyllic landscape of the three versions of the dream he has resorted to Claude Lorrain whose insipid delights he so prized just as Nietzsche did What an abyss is supposed by so disconcerting a predilection But the moment it is a matter of depicting the disintegration of original felicity the decor and dizziness of the fall he borrows nothing from anyone he mines himself dismisses any alien suggestion he even stops imagining and dreaming he sees And at last he finds himself in his element at the heart of the iron age for the love of which he had battled against the crystal palace and sacrificed Eden VII When so authoritative a voice has taught us the fragility of the former golden age and the nullity of the future one we must draw the consequences and no longer let ourselves be deceived by Hesiod s divagations or by those of Prometheus still less by that synthesis of them the utopias have attempted Harmony universal or otherwise has never existed and never will exist As for justice in order to believe it possible in order even to imagine it we must have the advantage of a supernatural talent for blindness of an unprecedented election a divine grace reinforced by a diabolic one and count further on an effort of generosity from heaven and hell alike an effort in truth highly improbable on the one side as on the other According to Karl Barth we could not even draw a breath of life if deep within us there did not exist this certainty God is just Yet there are those who still manage to live without knowing that certainty even without ever having known it What is their secret and knowing what they know by what miracle do they still draw breath However pitiless our denials we never quite destroy the objects of our nostalgia our dreams survive our waking and our analysis Though we have stopped believing in the geographical reality of paradise and in its various figurations it resides within us nonetheless a supreme given a dimension of our original ego now the question is to discover it there When we succeed we enter into that glory the theologians call essential but it is not God we see face to face it is the eternal present wrested from becoming and from eternity itself    What does history matter from that moment it is not the seat of being it is its absence the no of all things the rupture of the living with themselves not being kneaded of the same substance as history we refuse to cooperate any further with its convulsions Let it crush us it will affect only our appearances and our impurities those vestiges of time we still drag behind us symbols of failure scars of nondeliverance The remedy for all our ills must be sought within ourselves in the timeless principle of our nature If the unreality of such a principle were proved we should be lost without hope of appeal What proof could prevail however against the intimate impassioned conviction that some part of us escapes duration against the irruption of those moments when God coincides with a clarity suddenly appearing at our limits a beatitude which projects us far into ourselves a seizure outside the universe No more past no more future the centuries collapse matter abdicates the shadows are exhausted death turns to ridicule and ridiculous too is life itself And this seizure even if we have experienced it only once would suffice to reconcile us with all our shames and miseries of which it is doubtless the recompense It is as if all time had come to visit us for one final instance before disappearing    No use retracing the old paradise or racing toward the one to come the former is inaccessible the latter unrealizable What matters on the other hand is to internalize nostalgia or expectation necessarily frustrated when they venture outward and to constrain them to divulge or to create within us the happiness we respectively regret or anticipate No paradise unless deep within our being and somehow in the very heart of the self the self s self and even here in order to find it we must have inspected every paradise past and possible have loved and hated them with all the clumsiness of fanaticism scrutinized and rejected them with the competence of disappointment itself Let it be said that we substitute one ghost for another that the fables of the golden age are well worth the eternal present we dream of and that the original ego basis of our hopes evokes the void and ultimately reduces itself to it    Yet a void that affords plenitude a fulfilling void does it not contain more reality than all history possesses from beginning to end There are writers that one seeks out and there are writers that one stumbles upon Emil Cioran is arguably of the latter kind Such was my own introduction to his work as a student meandering one rainy afternoon in a used bookstore in Seattle In the philosophy section probably squeezed between Cicero and Confucius was a book that jumped out simply by its title A Short History of Decay Spinecreased and slightly dogeared it was by an author I knew nothing about But the title was evocative Decay decline decadence these are never popular topics especially in an era such as ours equally enamored with the explanatory power of science as we are with an almost religious preoccupation with selfhelp But how can one write a short history of decay And is there not something contradictory in assembling a history of decay Even the original French title Precis de decomposition is curious In French one often gives the title Precis to textbook summaries for example a Precis de litterature francaise or a Precis de mathematiques But a precis of decay It seemed absurd to write such a book And so I bought it That used bookstore no longer exists though I still have my copy of Cioran s book Originally published in  A Short History of Decay was the first book Cioran wrote in French Born in the small Romanian village of Rasinari in  Cioran attended university in Bucharest where he discovered the works of Pascal and Nietzsche While there he befriended Mircea Eliade and Eugene Ionesco and while still in his twenties he published several books in Romanian of impassioned and lyrical prose He also became enthralled by the turbulent politics of the time an enthusiasm that eventually gave way to disillusionment and bitterness In the late s with the support of the French Institute in Bucharest Cioran was in Paris ostensibly to write his philosophy thesis Instead he spent many of his days bicycling around France For Cioran it was a time of intense poverty not only was it difficult to make ends meet but he experienced both a cultural and linguistic selfexile writing in a language not his own in a style composed entirely of fragments during the long nights of insomnia that he would struggle with his entire life In the s against the backdrop of world war Cioran began a project originally entitled Exercices negatifs Negative Exercises  then Penseur d occasion SecondHand Thinker  before finally becoming Precis de decomposition or A Short History of Decay in the present translation The project opened a floodgate in his thinking resulting in some eight hundred manuscript pages and four different manuscript versions of the book When A Short History of Decay was published it tended to polarize readers Many dismissed it as overly morose and pessimistic completely out of tune with the obligatory optimism of postwar European culture Others praised it for precisely these reasons in his review of the book Maurice Nadeau proclaimed Cioran the one whose arrival has been prepared by all the philosophers of the void and of the absurd harbinger of bad news par excellence  The original impact of Cioran s book can still be felt in reading A Short History of Decay today Like Nietzsche Cioran is intent on exposing the hypocrisies of the human condition but unlike Nietzsche Cioran never once offers a way out a new horizon or even words of inspiration And yet there is an enthusiasm in Cioran s prose that comes through in spite of his predilection towards pessimism and despair It is because it rests on nothing because it lacks even the shadow of an argument that we persevere in life How invent a remedy for existence how conclude this endless cure And how recover from your own birth There is a kind of ecstasy of the worst in Cioran s writing that manifests itself in his many voices sometimes philosophical sometimes poetic sometimes political always polemical A Short History of Decay is at once a work of philosophy and yet a sort of song a conflicted and agonistic testament of the magnificent futility that is humanity and the ambivalence this book expresses is arguably more and more relevant today in our own era of climate change peak oil and disasters both natural and artificial Though his books are wellregarded today and though he received many literary prizes for them nearly all of which he refused  Cioran always held the worlds of literature and philosophy at arm s length His willful experiment with style has largely prevented his work from being easily recognized neither philosophy nor

Decrepit Man I ll join with black despair against my soul And to myself become an enemy Richard III Genealogy of Fanaticism In itself every idea is neutral or should be but man animates ideas projects his flames and flaws into them impure transformed into beliefs ideas take their place in time take shape as events the trajectory is complete from logic to epilepsy    whence the birth of ideologies doctrines deadly games Idolaters by instinct we convert the objects of our dreams and our interests into the Unconditional History is nothing but a procession of false Absolutes a series of temples raised to pretexts a degradation of the mind before the Improbable Even when he turns from religion man remains subject to it depleting himself to create fake gods he then feverishly adopts them his need for fiction for mythology triumphs over evidence and absurdity alike His power to adore is responsible for all his crimes a man who loves a god unduly forces other men to love his god eager to exterminate them if they refuse There is no form of intolerance of proselytism or ideological intransigence which fails to reveal the bestial substratum of enthusiasm Once man loses his faculty of indifference he becomes a potential murderer once he transforms his idea into a god the consequences are incalculable We kill only in the name of a god or of his counterfeits the excesses provoked by the goddess Reason by the concept of nation class or race are akin to those of the Inquisition or of the Reformation The ages of fervor abound in bloody exploits a Saint Teresa could only be the contemporary of the autodafe a Luther of the repression of the Peasants Revolt In every mystic outburst the moans of victims parallel the moans of ecstasy    Scaffolds dungeons jails flourish only in the shadow of a faith of that need to believe which has infested the mind forever The devil pales beside the man who owns a truth his truth We are unfair to a Nero a Tiberius it was not they who invented the concept heretic they were only degenerate dreamers who happened to be entertained by massacres The real criminals are men who establish an orthodoxy on the religious or political level men who distinguish between the faithful and the schismatic When we refuse to admit the interchangeable character of ideas blood flows    firm resolves draw the dagger fiery eyes presage slaughter No wavering mind infected with Hamletism was ever pernicious the principle of evil lies in the will s tension in the incapacity for quietism in the Promethean megalomania of a race that bursts with ideals that explodes with its convictions and that in return for having forsaken doubt and sloth vices nobler than all its virtues has taken the path to perdition into history that indecent alloy of banality and apocalypse    Here certitudes abound suppress them best of all suppress their consequences and you recover paradise What is the Fall but the pursuit of a truth and the assurance you have found it the passion for a dogma domicile within a dogma The result is fanaticism fundamental defect which gives man the craving for effectiveness for prophecy for terror a lyrical leprosy by which he contaminates souls subdues them crushes or exalts them    Only the skeptics or idlers or aesthetes escape because they propose nothing because they humanity s true benefactors undermine fanaticism s purposes analyze its frenzy I feel safer with a Pyrrho than with a Saint Paul for a jesting wisdom is gentler than an unbridled sanctity In the fervent mind you always find the camouflaged beast of prey no protection is adequate against the claws of a prophet    Once he raises his voice whether in the name of heaven of the city or some other excuse away with you satyr of your solitude he will not forgive your living on the wrong side of his truths and his transports he wants you to share his hysteria his fullness he wants to impose it on you and thereby to disfigure you A human being possessed by a belief and not eager to pass it on to others is a phenomenon alien to the earth where our mania for salvation makes life unbreathable Look around you everywhere specters preaching each institution translates a mission city halls have their absolute even as the temples officialdom with its rules a metaphysics designed for monkeys   Everyone trying to remedy everyone s life even beggars even the incurable aspire to it the sidewalks and hospitals of the world overflow with reformers The longing to become a source of events affects each man like a mental disorder or a desired malediction Society an inferno of saviors What Diogenes was looking for with his lantern was an indifferent man    It is enough for me to hear someone talk sincerely about ideals about the future about philosophy to hear him say we with a certain inflection of assurance to hear him invoke others and regard himself as their interpreter for me to consider him my enemy I see in him a tyrant manque an approximate executioner quite as detestable as the firstrate tyrants the firstrate executioners Every faith practices some form of terror all the more dreadful when the pure are its agents We mistrust the swindler the trickster the con man yet to them we can impute none of history s great convulsions believing in nothing it is not they who rummage in your hearts or your ulterior motives they leave you to your apathy to your despair or to your uselessness to them humanity owes the few moments of prosperity it has known it is they who save the peoples whom fanatics torture and idealists destroy Doctrineless they have only whims and interests accommodating vices a thousand times more endurable than the ravages provoked by principled despotism for all of life s evils come from a conception of life An accomplished politician should search out the ancient sophists and take lessons in oratory and in corruption    Whereas the fanatic is incorruptible if he kills for an idea he can just as well get himself killed for one in either case tyrant or martyr he is a monster No human beings more dangerous than those who have suffered for a belief the great persecutors are recruited among the martyrs not quite beheaded Far from diminishing the appetite for power suffering exasperates it hence the mind feels more comfortable in the society of a braggart than in that of a martyr and nothing is more repugnant to it than the spectacle of dying for an idea    Revolted by the sublime and by carnage the mind dreams of a provincial ennui on the scale of the universe of a History whose stagnation would be so grot that doubt would take on the lineaments of an event and hope a calamity   The AntiProphet In every man sleeps a prophet and when he wakes there is a little more evil in the world    The compulsion to preach is so rooted in us that it emerges from depths unknown to the instinct for selfpreservation Each of us awaits his moment in order to propose something anything He has a voice that is enough It costs us dear to be neither deaf nor dumb    From snobs to scavengers all expend their criminal generosity all hand out formulas for happiness all try to give directions life in common thereby becomes intolerable and life with oneself still more so if you fail to meddle in other people s business you are so uneasy about your own that you convert your self into a religion or apostle in reverse you deny it altogether we are victims of the universal game    The abundance of solutions to the aspects of existence is equaled only by their futility History a factory of ideals    lunatic mythology frenzy of hordes and f solitaries    refusal to look reality in the face mortal thirst for fictions    The source of our actions resides in an unconscious propensity to regard ourselves as the center the cause and the conclusion of time Our reflexes and our pride transform into a planet the parcel of flesh and consciousness we are If we had the right sense of our position in the world if to compare were inseparable from to live the revelation of our infinitesimal presence would crush us But to live is to blind ourselves to our own dimensions    And if all our actions from breathing to the founding of empires or metaphysical systems derive from an illusion as to our importance the same is true a fortiori of the prophetic instinct Who with the exact vision of his nullity would try to be effective and to turn himself into a savior Nostalgia for a world without ideals for an agony without doctrine for an eternity without life    Paradise    But we could not exist one second without deceiving ourselves the prophet in each of us is just the seed of madness which makes us flourish in our void The ideally lucid hence ideally normal man should have no recourse beyond the nothing that is in him    I can imagine him saying Torn from the goal from all goals I retain of my desires and my displeasures only their formulas Having resisted the temptation to conclude I have overcome the mind as I have overcome life itself by the horror of looking for an answer to it The spectacle of man what an emetic Love a duel of salivas   All the feelings milk their absolute from the misery of the glands Nobility is only in the negation of existence in a smile that surveys annihilated landscapes Once I had a self now I am no more than an object   I gorge myself on all the drugs of solitude those of the world were too weak to make me forget it Having killed the prophet in me how could I still have a place among men In the Graveyard of Definitions Are we entitled to imagine a mind exclaiming Everything is purposeless to me now for I have given the definitions of all things  And if we could imagine such a mind how locate it within duration What surrounds us we endure better for giving it a name and moving on But to embrace a thing by a definition however arbitrary and all the more serious the more arbitrary it is since the soul then overtakes knowledge is to reject that thing to render it insipid and superfluous to annihilate it The idle empty mind which joins the world only by the grace of sleep can practice only by extending the name of things by emptying diem and substituting formulas for them Then it maneuvers over their debris no more sensations nothing but memories Under each formula lies a corpse being and object alike die under the pretext they have occasioned This is the mind s frivolous funereal debauch And this mind has squandered itself in what it has named and circumscribed Infatuated by syllables it loathed the mystery of heavy silences and turned them light and pure and it too has become light and pure indeed lightened and purified of everything The vice of defining has made it a gracious assassin and a discreet victim This is how the stain the soul spread over the mind has been removed the only thing which reminded it that it was alive Civilization and Frivolity How could we bear the weight and sheer depth of works and masterpieces if to their texture certain impertinent and delicious minds had not added the fringes of subtle scorn and ready ironies And how could we endure the codes the customs the paragraphs of the heart which inertia and propriety have superimposed upon the futile and intelligent vices if it were not for those playful beings whose refinement puts them at once at the apex and in the margin of society We must be thankful to the civilizations which have not taken an overdose of seriousness which have played with values and taken their pleasure in begetting and destroying them Who knows outside of the Greek and French civilizations a more lucidly facetious proof of the elegant nothingness of things The age of Alcibiades and the eighteenth century in France are two sources of consolation While it is only at their final stages at the dissolution of a whole system of behavior and belief that the other civilizations could enjoy that lively exercise which lends a flavor of futility to life it was in full ripeness in full possession of their powers and of the future that these two epochs knew the tedium heedless of everything and permeable to everything What better symbol than that of Madame du Deffand old blind and perspicacious who even while execrating life nonetheless relished to the last its every amenity of gall No one achieves frivolity straight off It is a privilege and an art it is the pursuit of the superficial by those who having discerned the impossibility of any certitude have conceived a disgust for such things it is the escape far from one abyss or another which being by nature bottomless can lead nowhere There remain nonetheless the appearances why not raise them to the level of a style Thereby we define every intelligent period Thereby we find more prestige in expression than in the soul which supports it in grace than in intuition emotion itself becomes polite The human being delivered to himself without any partiality for elegance is a monster he finds only dark regions there where terror and negation imminent prowl To know by all one s vitality that one will die and to be unable to conceal it is an act of barbarism Any sincere philosophy renounces the claims of civilization whose function consists in sifting our secrets and disguising them as recherche effects Thus frivolity is the most effective antidote to the disease of being what one is by frivolity we abuse the world and dissimulate the impropriety of our depths Without its artifices how could we help blushing to have a soul Our skindeep solitudes what an inferno for other people But it is always for them and sometimes for ourselves that we invent our appearances    Dissolving into God The mind scrupulous of its distinct essence is threatened at every turn by the things it rejects Often abandoning attention the greatest of its privileges such a mind yields to the temptations it has sought to escape or becomes the prey of impure mysteries    Who has not known those fears those dizzy spells those deliriums which bring us back to the beast back to the last problems Our knees tremble but do not bend our hands clutch without clasping each other our eyes look up and see nothing    We preserve that vertical pride which strengthens its courage that horror of gestures which saves us from spectacle and the succor of eyelids to veil an absurdly ineffable gaze Our collapse is imminent but not inevitable the accident is odd but scarcely new already a smile dawns on the horizon of our terrors    we shall not topple into prayer   For after all He must not triumph it is up to our irony to compromise His capital letter up to our heart to dissolve the shudders He dispenses If such a Being really existed if our weaknesses vanquished our resolutions and our depths our deliberations then why go on thinking since our difficulties would be settled our questions suspended and our fears allayed Which would be too easy Every absolute personal or abstract is a way of avoiding the problems and not only the problems but also their root which is nothing but a panic of the senses God a perpendicular fall upon our fear a salvation landing like a thunderbolt amid our investigations which no hope deceives the immediate annihilation of our unconsoled and determinedly inconsciable pride a sidetracking of the individual the soul on the dole for lack of anxiety   What greater renunciation than Faith True without it we are committed to an infinity of dead ends But even when we know that nothing leads anywhere that the universe is only a byproduct of our gloom why should we sacrifice this pleasure of tottering and of splitting our skulls against heaven and earth The solutions offered by our ancestral cowardice are the worst desertions of our duty to intellectual decency To be fooled to live and die duped is certainly what men do But there exists a dignity which keeps us from disappearing into God and which transforms all our moments into prayers we shall never offer Variations on Death I It is because it rests on nothing because it lacks even the shadow of an argument that we persevere in life Death is too exact it has all the reasons on its side Mysterious for our instincts it takes shape to our reflection limpid without glamor and without the false lures of the unknown By dint of accumulating nonmysteries and monopolizing nonmeanings life inspires more dread than death it is life which is the Great Unknown Where can so much Void and Incomprehensibility lead We cling to the days because the desire to die is too logical hence ineffective If life had a single argument in its favor distinct indisputable it would annihilate itself instincts and prejudices collapse at the contact of Rigor Everything that breathes feeds on the unverifiable a dose of logic would be deadly to existence that effort toward the Senseless    Give life a specific goal and it immediately loses its attraction The inexactitude of its ends makes life superior to death one touch of precision would degrade it to the triviality of the tombs For a positive science of the meaning of life would depopulate the earth in a day and not even a madman could succeed in reviving the fruitful improbability of Desire II Men can be classified according to the most whimsical criteria according to their humors their inclinations their dreams or their glands We change ideas like neckties for every idea every criterion comes from outside from the configurations and accidents of time But there is something that comes from ourselves that is ourselves an invisible but inwardly verifiable reality an unwonted and eternal presence that we can conceive at any moment and that we never dare admit which is real only before its consummation death the true criterion    And it is death the most intimate dimension of all the living which separates humanity into two orders so irreducible so removed from each other that there is more distance between them than between a vulture and a mole a star and a starfish The abyss of two incommunicable worlds opens between the man who has the sentiment of death and the man who does not yet both die but one is unaware of his death the other knows one dies only for a moment the other unceasingly    Their common condition locates them precisely at each other s antipodes at the two extremities and within one and the same definition irreconcilable they suffer the same fate    One lives as if he were eternal the other thinks continually of his eternity and denies it in each thought Nothing can change our life but the gradual insinuation within us of the forces which annihilate it No new principle comes to it from the surprises of our growth nor from the efflorescence of our gifts they are merely natural to it And nothing natural can make us anything but ourselves Everything which prefigures death adds a quality of novelty to life modifies and amplifies it Health preserves life as such in a sterile identity while disease is an activity the most intense a man can indulge in a frenetic and    stationary movement the richest expenditure of energy without gesture the hostile and impassioned expectation of an irreparable lightning bolt III Against the obsession with death both the subterfuges of hope and the arguments of reason lay down their arms their insignificance merely whets the appetite to die In order to triumph over this appetite there is but one method to live it to the end to submit to all its pleasures all its pangs to do nothing to elude it An obsession experienced to the point of satiety is annihilated in its own excesses By dwelling on the infinity of death thought manages to use it up to inspire disgust for it in us disgust that negative superfluity which spares nothing and which before compromising and diminishing the prestige of death shows us the inanity of life The man who has not given himself up to the pleasures of anguish who has not savored in his mind the dangers of his own extinction nor relished such cruel and sweet annihilations will never be cured of the obsession with death he will be tormented by it for he will have resisted it while the man who habituated to a discipline of horror and meditating upon his own carrion has deliberately reduced himself to ashes that man will look toward death s past and he himself will be merely a resurrected being who can no longer live His method will have cured him of both life and death Every crucial experience is fatal the layers of existence lack density the man who explores them archaeologist of the heart of being finds himself at the end of his researches confronting empty depths He will vainly regret the panoply of appearances Hence the ancient Mysteries socalled revelations of the ultimate secrets have bequeathed us nothing by way of knowledge The initiates were doubtless obliged to keep silence yet it is inconceivable that not a single chatterbox was among their number what is more contrary to human nature than such stubbornness in secrecy The fact is that there were no secrets there were rites there were shudders Once the veils had fallen what could they discover but insignificant consequences The only initiation is to nothingness and to the mockery of being alive    And I dream of an Eleusis of disabused hearts of a lucid Mystery without gods and without the vehemences of illusion In the Margin of Moments It is our incapacity to weep which sustains our taste for things which makes them exist at all it keeps us from exhausting their savor and from turning away When on so many brinks and byroads our eyes refused to drown in themselves their dryness preserved the object which amazed them Our tears squander nature as our terrors do God    but in the end they squander ourselves For we exist only by the refusal to give free rein to our supreme desires the things which enter the sphere of our admiration or our despair remain there only because we have neither sacrificed them nor blessed them with our liquid farewells So it is that after each night facing a new day the impossible necessity of dealing with it fills us with dread exiled in light as if the world had just started inventing the sun we flee from tears just one of which would be enough to wash us out of time Dislocation of Time The moments follow each other nothing lends them the illusion of a content or the appearance of a meaning they pass their course is not ours we contemplate that passage prisoners of a stupid perception The heart s void confronting time s two mirrors reflecting each other s absence one and the same image of nullity   As though by the effect of a dreamy idiocy everything is leveled no more peaks no more plunges    Where to locate the poetry of lies the goad of an enigma The man who knows nothing of ennui is still in the world s childhood when the ages were waiting to be born he remains closed off from that tired time which outlives itself which laughs at its dimensions and succumbs on the threshold of its own    future dragging along matter suddenly raised to a lyricism of negation Ennui is the echo in us of time tearing itself apart    the revelation of the void the drying up of that delirium which sustains or invents life    Creator of values man is the delirious creature par excellence victim of the belief that something exists whereas he need merely hold his breath everything stops suspend his emotions nothing stirs suppress his whims the world turns to ashes Reality is a creation of our excesses of our disproportions and derangements Rein in your palpitations and the course of events slows down without our ardors space is ice Time itself passes only because our desires beget that decorative universe which a jot of lucidity would lay bare One touch of clearsightedness reduces us to our primal state nakedness a suspicion of irony strips us of that trumpery hope which let us dupe ourselves and devise illusion every contrary path leads outside of life Ennui is merely the beginning of such an itinerary    It makes us find time long too long unsuited to show us an end Detached from every object having nothing external to assimilate we destroy ourselves in slow motion since the future has stopped offering us a raison detre Ennui shows us an eternity which is not the transcendence of time but its wreck it is the infinity of souls that have rotted for lack of superstitions a banal absolute where nothing any longer keeps things from turning in circles in search of their own Fall Life creates itself in delirium and is undone in ennui The man suffering from a characterized sickness is not entitled to complain he has an occupation The great sufferers are never bored disease fills them the way remorse feeds the great criminals For any intense suffering produces a simulacrum of plenitude and proposes a terrible reality to consciousness which it cannot elude while suffering without substance in that temporal mourning of ennui affords consciousness nothing that forces it to fruitful action How to cure an unlocalized and supremely impalpable disease which infects the body without leaving any trace upon it which insinuates itself into the soul without marking it by any sign Ennui is like a sickness we have survived but one which has absorbed our possibilities our reserves of attention and has left us impotent to fill the void which follows upon the disappearance of our pangs and the fading of our torments Hell is a haven next to this displacement in time this empty and prostrate languor in which nothing stops us but the spectacle of the universe decaying before our eyes What therapeutics to invoke against a disease we no longer remember and whose aftermath encroaches upon our days How invent a remedy for existence how conclude this endless cure And how recover from your own birth Ennui that incurable convalescence    Magnificent Futility With the exception of the Greek skeptics and the Roman emperors of the Decadence all minds seem enslaved by a municipal vocation Only these two groups are emancipated the former by doubt the latter by dementia from the insipid obsession of being useful Having promoted the arbitrary to the rank of drill or delirium depending on whether they were philosophers or disabused scions of the old conquerors they were attached to nothing in this regard they suggest the saints But while the saints were never to collapse these others found themselves at the mercy of their own game masters and victims of their whims true solitaries since their solitude was sterile No one has followed their example and they themselves proposed no such thing hence they communicated with their kind only by irony and terror   To be the dissolvent of a philosophy or of an empire what pride could be more melancholy and more majestic To kill on the one hand truth and greatness on the other manias which nourish the mind and the city to undermine the architecture of the facades protecting the thinker s pride and the citizen s to flex to the point of fracturing the springs of their impulse to conceive and to will to discredit by the subtleties of sarcasm and torture both traditional abstractions and honorable customs what delicate and brutal effervescence Nothing beguiles where the gods die before our eyes In Rome where they were replaced imported where they could be seen to wither what pleasure to invoke ghosts with yet the one fear that this sublime versatility might capitulate to the assault of some severe and impure deity    which is what happened It is not easy to destroy an idol it takes as much time as is required to promote and to worship one For it is not enough to annihilate its material symbol which is easy but its roots in the soul How turn your eyes toward the twilight ages when the past was liquidated under a scrutiny which only the void could dazzle without being moved by that great art which is the death of a civilization    And so I dream of having been one of those slaves coming from an improbable country barbarous and brooding to languish in the agony of Rome my vague desolation embellished by Greek sophistries In the vacant eyes of the statues in the idols shrunken by sagging superstitions I should have forgotten all about my ancestors my yokes and my regrets Espousing the melancholy of the ancient symbols I should have liberated myself I should have shared the dignity of the abandoned gods defending them against the insidious crosses against the invasion of servants and martyrs and my nights would have sought their rest in the delirium and debauchery of the Caesars Expert in disillusions riddling the new fervors with all the arrows of a dissolute wisdom among the courtesans in skeptical brothels or circuses with their sumptuous cruelties I should have swelled my reasonings with vice and with blood dilating logic to dimensions it had never dreamed of to the dimensions of worlds that die Exegesis of Failure Each of us is born with a share of purity predestined to be corrupted by our commerce with mankind by that sin against solitude For each of us will do anything in order not to be doomed to himself Our kind is not a fatality but the temptation to fail Incapable of keeping our hands clean and our hearts undiluted we soil ourselves upon contact with strange sweats we wallow craving for disgust and fervent for pestilence in the unanimous mud And when we dream of seas changed into holy water it is too late to dive into them and our advanced state of corruption keeps us from drowning there the world has infested our solitude upon us the traces of others become indelible In the gamut of creatures only man inspires a sustained disgust The repugnance which an animal begets is provisional it never ripens in thought whereas our kind obsesses our reflections infiltrates the mechanism of our detachment from the world in order to confirm us in our system of refusal and nonadherence After each conversation whose refinement alone is enough to indicate the level of a civilization why is it impossible not to regret the Sahara and not to envy the plants or the endless monologues of zoology If with each word we win a victory over nothingness it is only the better to endure its reign We die in proportion to the words which we fling around us    Those who speak have no secrets And we all speak We betray ourselves we exhibit our heart executioner of the unspeakable each of us labors to destroy all the mysteries beginning with our own And if we meet others it is to degrade ourselves together in a race to the void whether in the exchange of ideas schemes or confessions Curiosity has provoked not only the first fall but the countless ones of every day of our lives Life is only that impatience to fall to fail to prostitute the soul s virginal solitudes by dialogue ageless and everyday negation of Paradise Man should listen only to himself in the endless ecstasy of the intransmissible Word should create words for his own silences and assents audible only to his regrets But he is the chatterbox of the universe he speaks in the name of others his self loves the plural And anyone who speaks in the name of others is always an impostor Politicians reformers and all who rely on a collective pretext are cheats There is only the artist whose lie is not a total one for he invents only himself Outside of the surrender to the incommunicable the suspension amid our mute and unconsoled anxieties life is merely a fracas on an unmapped terrain and the universe a geometry stricken with epilepsy The implicit plural of one and the avowed plural of we constitute the comfortable refuge of false existence Only the poet takes responsibility for I he alone speaks in his own name he alone is entitled to do so Poetry is bastardized when it becomes permeable to prophecy or to doctrine mission smothers music idea shackles inspiration Shelly s generous aspect cripples most of his work Shakespeare by a stroke of luck never served anything The victory of nonauthenticity is fulfilled in philosophical activity that complacence in one and in prophetic activity whether religious moral or political  that apotheosis of we Definition is the lie of the abstract mind inspired formula the lie of the militant one a definition is always the cornerstone of a temple a formula inescapably musters the faithful Thus all teachings begin How then fail to turn to poetry It has like life the excuse of proving nothing Coalition against Death How imagine other people s lives when our own seems scarcely conceivable We meet someone we see him plunged into an impenetrable and unjustifiable world in a mass of desires and convictions superimposed on reality like a morbid structure Having made a system of mistakes for himself he suffers for reasons whose nullity alarms the mind and surrenders himself to values whose absurdity leaps to the eye What are his undertakings but trifles and is the feverish symmetry of his concerns any better built than an architecture of twaddle To the outside observer the absolute of each life looks interchangeable and every fate however fixed in its essence arbitrary When our convictions seem the fruit of a frivolous lunacy how tolerate other people s passions for themselves and for their own multiplication in each day s utopia By what necessity does this man shut himself up in a particular world of predilections and that man in another When we endure the confidences of a friend or a stranger the revelation of his secrets fills us with astonishment Are we to relate his torments to drama or to farce This depends entirely on the good will or the exasperations of our lassitude Each fate being no more than a refrain fluttering around a few bloodstains it is up to our moods to see in the disposition of such sufferings a superfluous and piquant order or a pretext for pity Since it is difficult to approve the reasons people invoke each time we leave one of our fellow men the question which comes to mind is invariably the same how does he keep from killing himself For nothing is more natural than to imagine other people s suicide When we have glimpsed by an overwhelming and readily renewable intuition anyone s own uselessness it is incomprehensible that everyone has not done the same To do away with oneself seems such a clear and simple action Why is it so rare why does everyone avoid it Because if reason disavows the appetite for life the nothing which extends our acts is nonetheless of a power superior to all absolutes it explains the tacit coalition of mortals against death it is not only the symbol of existence but existence itself it is everything And this nothing this everything cannot give life a meaning but it nonetheless makes life persevere in what it is a state of nonsuicide Supremacy of the Adjective Since there can be only a limited number of ways to face the ultimate problems the mind is limited in its expansion by that natural boundary which is the essential by that impossibility of indefinitely multiplying the capital difficulties history is solely concerned with changing the aspect of a sum of questions and solutions What the mind invents is merely a series of new qualifications it rebaptizes the elements or seeks in its lexicons less eroded epithets for the one immutable pain We have always suffered but our suffering has been either sublime or legitimate or absurd according to the general views which the philosophic moment maintained Misery constitutes the texture of all that breathes but its modalities have changed course they have composed that series of irreducible appearances which lead each of us to believe he is the first to have suffered so The pride of such uniqueness incites us to cherish our own pain and to endure it In a world of sufferings each of them is a solipsist in relation to all the rest Misery s originality is due to the verbal quality which isolates it in the sum of words and sensations    The qualifiers change this change is called intellectual progress Suppress them all and what would remain of civilization The difference between intelligence and stupidity resides in the manipulation of the adjective whose use without diversity constitutes banality God Himself lives only by the adjectives we add to Him whereby the raison detre of theology Hence man by modulating the monotony of his misery ever variously justifies himself to the mind only by the impassioned search for a new adjective And yet this search is pitiable The poverty of expression which is the mind s poverty is manifest in the indigence of words in their exhaustion and their degradation the attributes by which we determine things and sensations finally lie before us like so much verbal carrion And we glance regretfully at the time when they gave off no more than an odor of confinement All Alexandrianism begins with the need to ventilate words to make up for their blemishes by a lively refinement but it ends in a lassitude in which mind and word are mingled and decompose Ideally the final stage of a literature and of a civilization imagine a Valery with the soul of a Nero    So long as our untried senses and our naive heart recognize themselves and delight in the universe of qualifications they flourish with the aid and at the risk of the adjective which once dissected proves inadequate deficient We say of space of time and of suffering that they are infinite but infinite has no more bearing than beautiful sublime harmonious ugly    Suppose we force ourselves to see to the bottom of words We see nothing each of them detached from the expansive and fertile soul being null and void The power of the intelligence functions by projecting a certain luster upon them by polishing them and making them glitter this power erected into a system is called culture pyrotechnics against a night sky of nothingness The Devil Reassured Why is God so dull so feeble so inadequately picturesque Why does He lack interest vigor actuality and resemble us so little Is there any image less anthropomorphic and more gratuitously remote How could we have projected into Him lights so dim and powers so unsteady Where have our energeis leaked away to where have our desires run out Who then has absorbed our overflow of vital insolence Shall we turn to the Devil But we cannot address our prayers to him to worship him would be to pray irrespectively to pray to ourselves We do not pray to what is the evidence the exact is not an object of worship We have placed in our double all our attributes and in order to afford him a semblance of solemnity we have dressed him in black our vices and our virtues in mourning By endowing him with wickedness and perseverance our dominant qualities we have exhausted ourselves to make him as lively as possible our powers have been used up in creating his image in making him agile frisky intelligent ironic and above all petty The reserves of energy we still had left to produce God were reduced to nothing Then we resorted to the imagination and to what little blood we had left God could be only the fruit of our anemia a tottering and rachitic image He is mild good sublime just But who recognizes himself in that mixture redolent of rose water relegated to transcendence A Being without duplicity lacks depth lacks mystery He hides nothing Only impurity is a sign of reality And if the saints are not completely stripped of interest it is because their sublimity is tinged with the novelistic their eternity lends itself to biography their lives indicate that they have left the world for a genre capable of captivating us from time to time    Because he overflows with life the Devil has no altar man recognizes himself too readily in him to worship him he detests him for good reason he repudiates himself and maintains the indigent attributes of God But the Devil never complains and never aspires to found a religion are we not here to safeguard him from inanition and oblivion Promenade around the Circumference Within the circle which encloses human beings in a community of interests and hopes the mind opposed to mirages clears a path from the center toward the periphery It can no longer hear at close range the hum of humanity it wants to consider from as far away as possible the accursed symmetry which links men together It sees martyrs everywhere some sacrificing themselves for visible needs others for inestimable necessities all ready to bury their names under a certitude and since not all of them can succeed the majority expiate by banality the overflow of blood they have dreamed of    their lives consist of an enormous freedom to die which they have not taken advantage of inexpressive holocaust of history the boneyard swallows them up But the enthusiast of separations seeking paths unhaunted by the hordes withdraws to the extreme margin and follows the rim of the circle which he cannot cross so long as he is subject to the body yet Consciousness soars farther quite pure in an ennui without beings or objects No longer suffering superior to the excuses which invite dying Consciousness forgets the man who supports it More unreal than a star glimpsed in some hallucination it suggests the condition of a sidereal pirouette while on life s circumference the soul promenades meeting only itself over and over again itself and its impotence to answer the call of the Void The Sundays of Life If Sunday afternoons were extended for months where would humanity get to liberated from sweat from the weight of the first curse The experiment would be worth the trouble It is more than likely that crime would become the sole diversion that debauchery would seem candor shouting melody and jeers tenderness The sensation of time s immensity would make each second into an intolerable torment a sublime firing squad In hearts imbued with poetry would appear a blase cannibalism and a hyena s melancholy butchers and executioners would die out of lethargy churches and brothels would split with sighs The universe transformed into a Sunday afternoon    it is the very definition of ennui and the end of the universe    Take away the curse hanging over History and it immediately vanishes like existence itself in absolute vacancy exposing its fiction Labor builds on nothingness creates and consolidates myths elementary intoxication it excites and maintains the belief in reality but contemplation of pure existence contemplation independent of actions and objects assimilates only what is not    The idle apprehend more things are deeper than the industrious no task limits their horizon born into an eternal Sunday they watch and watch themselves watching Sloth is a somatic skepticism the way the flesh doubts In a world of inaction the idle would be the only ones not to be murderers But they do not belong to humanity and sweat not being their strong point they live without suffering the consequences of Life and of Sin Doing neither good nor evil they disdain spectators of the human convulsion the weeks of time the efforts which asphyxiate consciousness What would they have to fear from a limitless extension of certain afternoons except the regret of having supported a crudely elementary obviousness Then exasperation in the truth might induce them to imitate the others and to indulge in the degrading temptation of tasks This is the danger which threatens sloth that miraculous residue of paradise Love s one function is to help us endure those cruel and incommensurable Sunday afternoons which torment us for the rest of the week and for eternity Without the allurement of the ancestral spasm we should require a thousand eyes for hidden tears or else nails to bite milelong nails    How else kill this time which no longer passes On those interminable Sundays the disease of being is utterly plain Sometimes we manage to forget ourselves in something but how forget ourselves in the world itself This impossibility is the definition of the disease The man who is afflicted by it will never be cured even if the universe changed altogether Only his heart should change but it is unchangeable hence for him to exist has only one meaning to dive into suffering until the exercise of a daybyday nirvanization raises him to the perception of unreality    Resignation It was in a clinic waiting room an old woman was telling me about her diseases    The controversies of men the hurricanes of history in her eyes trifles her sickness alone prevailed over time and space  can t eat I can t sleep I m afraid there must be some pus here    she began caressing her jaw with more interest than if the fate of the world depended on it At first this excess of selfconcern on the part of a decrepit crone left me torn between dread and disgust then I left the clinic before it was my turn determined to renounce my discomforts forever    Fiftynine seconds out of each of my minutes I reflected as I walked through the streets were dedicated to suffering or to    the idea of suffering If only I had a stone s vocation A heart origin of every torment   I aspire to the object to the blessing of matter and opacity The zigzagging of a gnat seems to me an apocalyptic enterprise It is a sin to get outside yourself   The wind air s insanity Music the madness of silence By capitulating to life this world has betrayed nothingness    I resign from movement and from my dreams Absence You shall be my sole glory    Let desire be forever stricken from the dictionary and from the soul I retreat before the dizzying farce of tomorrows And if I still cling to a few hopes I have lost forever the faculty of hoping The Indirect Animal What a downfall when you bear in mind by some radical obsession that man exists that he is what he is and that he cannot be otherwise But what he is a thousand definitions expose and none compels recognition the more arbitrary they are the more valid they seem The airiest absurdity and the weightiest banality are equally appropriate The infinity of his attributes composes the most imprecise being we can conceive Whereas the animals proceed directly to their goal man loses himself in detours he is the indirect animal par excellence His improbable reflexes from whose slackening consciousness derives transform Mm into a convalescent aspiring to disease Nothing in him is healthy except the fact of having been so Whether he is an angel that has lost his wings or an ape that has lost his hair he has been able to leave the anonymity of creatures only by the eclipses of his health His poorly constituted blood has allowed the infiltration of uncertainties approximations problems his wavering vitality the intrusion of question marks and exclamation points How define the virus which eroding his somnolence has stunned him with insomnia among the universal siesta What worm has burrowed into his repose what primal agent of knowledge has forced him to the backwardness of actions the arrested development of desires Who has introduced the first languor into his ferocity Emerging from the throng of the other living creatures he has created a subtler confusion for himself he has scrupulously exploited the ills of a life wrested from itself Out of all he has undertaken to be healed of himself a stranger disease has been constituted  his civilization is merely the effort to find remedies for an incurable and coveted state The mind wilts at the approach of health man is an invalid or he is nothing When having thought of everything he thinks of himself for he manages this only by the detour of the universe as if he were the last problem he proposes to himself he remains astonished confused embarrassed But he continues to prefer to the nature which eternally capsizes into health his own defeat Since Adam men s entire effort has been to modify man The aims of reform and of pedagogy articulated at the expense of irreducible data denature thought and distort its movement Knowledge has no more desperate enemy than the educative instinct at once optimistic and virulent which no philosopher can escape how would their systems be unscathed by it Outside the Irremediable everything is false false this civilization which seeks to combat it false the truths with which it arms itself Except for the ancient skeptics and the French moralists it would be hard to cite a single mind whose theories secretly or explicitly do not tend to mold man But he subsists unchanged though he has followed the parade of noble precepts proposed to his curiosity offered to his ardor and to his uncertainty Whereas all beings have their place in nature man remains a metaphysically straying creature lost in Life a stranger to the Creation No one has found a valid goal for history but everyone has proposed one and in the pullulation of goals so divergent and so fantastic the notion of finality has been canceled out and vanishes into a mocking clause of the mind Each of us takes on himself that unit of disaster which is the phenomenon man And the only meaning time has is to multiply these units endlessly to enlarge these vertical sufferings which depend upon a nonentity of matter upon the pride of a given name and upon a solitude without appeal The Key to Our Endurance The man who managed by an imagination overflowing with pity to record all the sufferings to be contemporary with all the pain and all the anguish of any given moment such a man supposing he could ever exist would be a monster of love and the greatest victim in the history of the human heart But it is futile to imagine such an impossibility We need merely proceed to an investigation of ourselves only undertake the archaeology of our alarms If we venture into the torment of the days it is because nothing halts this march except our pangs those of others seem to us explicable and capable of being transcended we believe they suffer because they lack sufficient will courage or lucidity Each suffering except ours seems to us legitimate or absurdly intelligible otherwise mourning would be the unique constant in the versatility of our sentiments But we wear only the mourning of ourselves If we could understand and love the infinity of agonies which languish around us all the lives which are hidden deaths we should require as many hearts as there are suffering beings And if we had a miraculously present memory which sustained the totality of our past pains we should succumb beneath such a burden Life is possible only by the deficiencies of our imagination and our memory We derive our power from our forgetting and from our incapacity to conceive of the plurality of simultaneous fates No one could survive the instantaneous comprehension of universal grief each heart being stirred only for a certain quantity of sufferings There are something like material limits to our endurance yet the expansion of each pang reaches and occasionally exceeds such limits this is too often the source of our ruin Whereupon the impression that each misery each disappointment is infinite Indeed they are but only for us for the limits of our own heart and if the latter had the dimensions of space itself our ills would be more spacious still since every pain replaces the world and for each unhappiness we require another universe Reason vainly strives to show us the infinitesimal proportions of our disasters it fails confronted with our penchant for cosmogonic proliferation Thus true madness is never due to chance or to the disasters of the brain but to the false conception of space the heart creates for itself    Annihilation by Deliverance A doctrine of salvation has meaning only if we start from the equation existence equals suffering It is neither a sudden realization nor a series of reasonings which lead us to this equation but the unconscious elaboration of our every moment the contribution of all our experiences minute or crucial When we carry germs of disappointments and a kind of thirst to see them develop the desire that the world should undermine our hopes at each step multiplies the voluptuous verifications of the disease The arguments come later the doctrine is constructed there still remains only the danger of wisdom But suppose we do not want to be free of suffering nor to conquer our contradictions and conflicts what if we prefer the nuances of the incomplete and an affective dialectic to the evenness of a sublime impasse Salvation ends everything and ends us Who once saved dares still call himself alive We really live only by the refusal to be delivered from suffering and by a kind of religious temptation of irreligiosity Salvation haunts only assassins and saints those who have killed or transcended the creature the rest wallow dead drunk in imperfection    The mistake of every doctrine of deliverance is to suppress poetry climate of the incomplete The poet would betray himself if he aspired to be saved salvation is the death of song the negation of art and of the mind How to feel integral with a conclusion We can refine we can farm our sufferings but by what means can we free ourselves from them without suspending ourselves Docile to malediction we exist only insofar as we suffer A soul enlarges and perishes only by as much insupportable as it assumes The Abstract Venom Even our vague ills our diffuse anxieties degenerating into physiology should by a converse impulse be restored to the maneuvers of the intelligence If we raised ennui tautological perception of the world the dull ripple of duration to the dignity of a deductive elegy if we offered it the temptation of a glamorous sterility Without resorting to an order superior to the soul the soul collapses into the flesh and physiology becomes the last word of our philosophic stupors To transpose immediate poisons into intellectual currency to make an instrument out of our palpable corruption or else to mask the impurity of every sentiment and sensation by norms is a pursuit of elegance necessary to the mind next to which the soul that pathetic hyena is merely profound and sinister The mind in itself can be only superficial its nature being uniquely concerned with the arrangement of conceptual events and not with their implications in the spheres they signify Our states interest it only insofar as they are transposable Thus melancholia emanates from our viscera and joins the cosmic void but the mind adopts melancholia only filtered of what attaches it to the fragility of the senses the mind interprets it refined melancholia becomes point of view departmental melancholia Theory lies in wait and seizes upon our venoms and renders them less noxious It is a degradation from above the mindasamateur of pure intoxications since it is the enemy of intensities The Consciousness of Misery Everything conspires elements and actions alike to harm you Arm yourself in disdain isolate yourself in a fortress of disgust dream of superhuman indifference The echoes of time would persecute you in your ultimate absences    When nothing can keep you from bleeding ideas themselves turn red or encroach on each other like tumors There is no specific in our pharmacies against existence nothing but minor remedies for braggarts But where is the antidote for lucid despair perfectly articulated proud and sure All of us are miserable but how many know it The consciousness of misery is too serious a disease to figure in an arithmetic of agonies or in the catalogues of the Incurable It belittles the prestige of hell and converts the slaughterhouses of time into idyls What sin have you committed to be born what crime to exist Your suffering like your fate is without motive To suffer truly to suffer is to accept the invasion of ills without the excuse of causality as a favor of demented nature as a negative miracle    In Time s sentence men take their place like commas while in order to end it you have immobilized yourself into a period Interjective Thought The idea of infinity must have been born on a day of slackening when some vague languor infiltrated into geometry like the first act of knowledge at the moment when in the silence of reflexes a macabre shudder isolated the perception of its object How many disgusts or nostalgias have we had to accumulate in order to waken at the end alone tragically superior to the evidence A forgotten sigh has made us take a step outside the immediate a banal fatigue has alienated us from a landscape or a person diffuse moans have separated us from sweet or timid innocences The sum of these accidental distances constitutes ledger of our days and nights the gap which distinguishes us from the world and which the mind strives to reduce and to restore to our fragile proportions But the creation of each lassitude makes itself felt where now to seek for the substance under our steps At first it is in order to escape things that we think then when we have gone too far in order to lose ourselves in the regret for our escape    And so our concepts are linked together like dissimulated sighs every reflection replaces an interjection a plaintive tonality submerges the dignity of logic Funereal hues dim our ideas hints of the graveyard encumber our paragraphs a whiff of mildew in our precepts the last day of autumn in a timeless crystal    The mind is defenseless against the miasmas which assail it for they rise from the most corrupt place that exists between earth and heaven from the place where madness lies down in tenderness cloaca of utopias and den of dreams our soul And even then when we could change the laws of the universe or foresee its whims our soul would subjugate us by its miseries by the principle of its ruin A soul which is not lost Where is such a thing so that we may draw up the interrogation so that science sanctity and comedy may seize upon it Apotheosis of the Vague We might apprehend the essence of nations even more than that of individuals by their way of participating in the vague The specifics in which they live reveal only their transitory character their peripheries their appearances What a nation can express has only a historical value its success in becoming but what it cannot express its failure in the eternal is the unproductive thirst for itself its effort to exhaust itself in expression being stricken with impotence it fills the gap by certain words allusions to the unspeakable    How many times in our peregrinations outside the intellect have we not rested our troubles in the shade of those Sehnsuchts yearnings saudades those sonorous fruits grown for overripe hearts Lift the veil from these words do they conceal the same content Is it possible that the same meaning lives and dies in the verbal ramifications of an identical stock Is it conceivable that such diverse peoples experience nostalgia in the same way The man who struggles to find the formula for the disease of the distant becomes the victim of a rickety architecture To get back to the source of these expressions of the vague we must make an affective regression toward their essence must drown in the ineffable and emerge from it with our concepts in tatters Once our theoretical assurance and our pride in the intelligible is lost we can try to understand everything to understand everything for itself Then we manage to rejoice in the inexpressible to spend our days in the margin of the comprehensible and to wallow in the suburbs of the sublime In order to escape sterility we must wear Reason s mourning    To live in expectation in what is not yet is to accept the stimulating disequilibrium implied by the very notion of future Every nostalgia is a transcendence of the present Even in the form of regret it assumes a dynamic character we want to force the past we want to act retroactively to protest against the irreversible Life has a content only in the violation of time The obsession of elsewhere is the impossibility of the moment and this impossibility is nostalgia itself That the French should have refused to feel and above all to cultivate the imperfection of the indefinite is certainly suggestive In a collective form this disease does not exist in France what the French call cafard has no metaphysical quality and ennui is managed angularly The French repel all complacency toward the Possible their language itself eliminates any complicity with its dangers Is there any other nation which finds itself more at ease in the world for which being chez soi has more meaning and more weight for which immanence offers more attractions In order to desire something else fundamentally we must be stripped of space and time we must live in a minimum of relationship with a site a moment The reason the history of France offers so few discontinuities is that fidelity to its essence which flatters our inclination to perfection and disappoints the craving for the incomplete which a tragic vision implies The only contagious thing in France is lucidity the horror of being fooled of being the victim of anything This is why a Frenchman accepts a risk only when he is fully conscious of it he wants to be fooled he bandages his eyes unconscious heroism rightly seems to him a lapse of taste an inelegant sacrifice But life s brutal ambiguity requires the triumph of the impulse and not of the will to be a corpse to be metaphysically fooled If the French have burdened nostalgia with too much clarity if they have stripped it of a certain intimate and dangerous glamor Sehnsucht on the other hand exhausts whatever is insoluble about it in the conflicts of the German soul torn between Heimat and Infinity How could it find satisfaction On one side the longing to be plunged into the undifferentiation of heart and hearth on the other to keep absorbing space in an unslaked desire And since extent offers no limits and since with it grows the penchant for new wanderings the goal retreats according to the progress made Whence the exotic taste the passion for journeys the delectation in landscape as landscape the lack of inner form the tortuous depth at once seductive and disheartening There is no solution to the tension between Heimat and Infinity for it is to be rooted and uprooted at one and the same time and to have been unable to find a compromise between the fireside and the faroff    Imperialism deadly constant in its ultimate essence what is it but the political and vulgarly concrete translation of Sehnsucht We cannot overemphasize the historical consequences of certain inner approximations Now nostalgia is one of these it keeps us from resting in existence or in the absolute it forces us to drift in the indistinct to lose our foundations to live uncovered in time To be torn from the earth exiled in duration cut off from one s immediate roots is to long for a reintegration in the original sources dating from before the separation and the severance Nostalgia is precisely to feel eternally distant from chez sot and outside the luminous proportions of Ennui and outside of the contradictory postulation of Heimat and Infinity it takes the form of the return to the finite to the immediate to a terrestrial and maternal appeal Like the mind the heart creates utopias and of them all the strangest is the utopia of a natal universe where we rest from ourselves a universe that is the cosmic pillow of all our lassitudes In nostalgic aspiration we do not want something palpable but a kind of abstract warmth heterogeneous to time and close to a paradisiac presentiment Whatever does not accept existence as such borders on theology Nostalgia is merely a sentimental theology in which the Absolute is built with the elements of desire in which God is Indeterminacy elaborated by languor Solitude Schism of the Heart We are doomed to perdition each time life does not reveal itself as a miracle each time the moment no longer moans in a supernatural shudder How renew that sensation of plenitude those seconds of delirium those volcanic flashes those wonders of fervor which reduce God to an accident of our clay By what subterfuge revive that explosion in which even music seems superficial the castoff of our inner organ It is not in our power to remember the seizures which made us coincide with the start of movement made us masters of the first moment of time and instantaneous artisans of the Creation We perceive no more of Creation than its destitution the grim reality we live in order to unlearn ecstasy And it is not the miracle which determines our tradition and our substance but the void of a universe frustrated of its flames engulfed in its own absences exclusive object of our rumination a lonely universe before a lonely heart each predestined to disjoin and to exasperate each other in the antithesis When the solitude is intensified to the point of constituting not so much our datum as our sole faith we cease to be integral with the whole heretics of existence we are banished from the community of the living whose sole virtue is to wait gasping for something which is not death But we emancipated from the fascination of such waiting rejected from the ecumenicity of illusion we are the most heretical sect of all for our soul itself is born in heresy When the soul is in a state of grace its beauty is so high and so admirable that it far surpasses all that is beautiful in nature and delights the eyes of God and the Angels Ignatius Loyola I have sought to settle in an ordinary grace I have tried to liquidate all interrogations and vanish in an ignorant light in any light disdainful of the intellect But how attain to the sigh of felicity superior to problems when no beauty illuminates you and when God and the Angels are blind Once when Teresa patron saint of Spain and of your soul prescribed a course of temptations and intoxications the transcendent abyss amazed you like a fall into the heavens But those heavens have vanished like the temptations and intoxications and in the cold heart the fevers of Avila are extinguished forever By what peculiarity of fate do certain beings having reached the point where they might coincide with a faith retreat to follow a path which leads them only to themselves and hence nowhere Is it out of fear that once installed in grace they might lose there their distinct virtues Each man develops at the expense of his depths each man is a mystic who denies himself the earth is inhabited by various forms of grace manque by trampled mysteries Twilight Thinkers Athens was dying and with it the worship of knowledge The great systems had run their course limited to the conceptual realm they rejected the intervention of torments the pursuit of deliverance and of inordinate meditation upon suffering The declining city having permitted the conversion of human disasters into theory no matter what sneeze or sudden death was supplanting the old problems The obsession with remedies marks the end of a civilization the search for salvation that of a philosophy Plato and Aristotle had yielded to such preoccupations only for the sake of equilibrium after them such concerns prevailed in every domain Rome waning took from Athens only the echoes of its decadence and the reflections of its collapse When the Greeks exercised their doubts throughout the Empire the latter s downfall and that of philosophy were virtually consummated All questions seeming legitimate the superstition of formal limits no longer prevented the debauch of arbitrary curiosities The infiltration of epicureanism and of stoicism was easy ethics replaced the abstract structures bastardized reason became the instrument of praxis In the streets of Rome with various recipes for happiness swarmed the epicureans and the stoics experts in wisdom noble charlatans appearing at the periphery of philosophy to treat an incurable and generalized lassitude But their therapeutics lacked the mythology and the strange anecdotes which in the universal enervation were to constitute the vigor of a religion unconcerned with nuance a religion originating more remotely than they Wisdom is the last word of an expiring civilization the nimbus of historic twilights fatigue transfigured into a vision of the world the last tolerance before the advent of other newer gods and of barbarism wisdom what we call sagesse is also a vain attempt at melody among the environing death rattles For the Sage theoretician of a limpid death hero of indifference and symbol of the last stage of philosophy of its degenerescence and its vacuity has solved the problem of his own death    and has thereupon suppressed all problems Provided with rarer absurdities he is a limitcase which we encounter in extreme periods as an exceptional confirmation of the general pathology Finding ourselves at a point symmetrical to the agony of the ancient world a victim of the same sicknesses and under similarly ineluctable charms we see the great systems destroyed by their limited perfection For us too everything becomes the substance of a philosophy without dignity and without rigor    Thought s impersonal fate has been scattered into a thousand souls a thousand humiliations of the Idea    Not Leibnitz Kant or Hegel are of any help to us any longer We have come with our own death to the doors of philosophy rotting on their hinges having nothing more to protect they open of their own accord    and anything becomes a philosophical subject Paragraphs are replaced by cries the consequence is a philosophy of the fundus animae whose intimacy will be reconnoitered in the appearances of history and the surfaces of time We too seek happiness either by frenzy or by disdain to scorn it is not yet to forget it and to reject it is a way of retaining it we too seek salvation if only by wanting nothing to do with it And if we are the negative heroes of an overripe age thereby we are its contemporaries to betray one s age or to be its fervent adept expresses in an apparent contradiction one and the same act of participation The lofty defeats the subtle decrepitudes the aspirations to timeless halos all leading to wisdom who would not recognize them in himself Who does not feel the right to assert everything in the void around him before the world vanishes in the dawn of an absolute or of a new negation A god is always threatening on the horizon We are in the margin of philosophy since we consent to its end Let us conduct ourselves so that the god does not settle in our thoughts let us still keep our doubts the appearances of equilibrium and the temptation of immanent destiny any arbitrary and fantastic aspiration being preferable to the inflexible truths We change cures finding none effective none valid because we have faith neither in the peace we seek nor in the pleasures we pursue Versatile sages we are the stoics and epicureans of modern Romes    Resources of SelfDestruction Born in a prison with burdens on our shoulders and our thoughts we could not reach the end of a single day if the possibilities of ending it all did not incite us to begin the next day all over again    Irons and the unbreathable air of this world strip us of everything except the freedom to kill ourselves and this freedom grants us a strength and a pride to triumph over the loads which overwhelm us What gift is more mysterious than being able to do what we will with ourselves and to refuse to do it Consolation by a possible suicide widens into infinite space this realm where we are suffocating The notion of destroying ourselves the multiplicity of means for doing so their ease and their proximity delight us and fill us with dread for there is nothing simpler and more terrible than the action by which we decide irrevocably upon ourselves In a single second we do away with all seconds God himself could not do as much But braggart demons we postpone our end how could we renounce the display of our freedom the show of our pride    The man who has never imagined his own annihilation who has not anticipated recourse to the rope the bullet poison or the sea is a degraded galley slave or a worm crawling upon the cosmic carrion This world can take everything from us can forbid us everything but no one has the power to keep us from wiping ourselves out Every tool offers its help every abyss invites us in but all our instincts oppose the act This contradiction develops an insoluble conflict in the mind When we begin to reflect upon life to discover in it an infinity of emptiness our instincts have already turned themselves into guides and middlemen of our acts they rein in the flight of our inspiration and the pliability of our detachment If at the moment of our birth we were as conscious as we are at the end of adolescence it is more than likely that at the age of five suicide would be a habitual phenomenon or even a question of honor But we wake too late we have against us the years nourished solely by the presence of the instincts which can be only stupefied by the conclusions to which our meditations and our disappointments lead And they react yet having acquired the consciousness of our freedom we are masters of a resolve all the more tempting in that we do not take advantage of it It makes us endure the days and what is more the nights we are no longer poor or crushed by adversity we possess supreme resources And even when we never exploit them when we expire in the usual way we have had a treasure in our very abandonments what greater wealth than the suicide each of us bears within himself If the religions have forbidden us to die by our own hand it is because they saw that such practices set an example of insubordination which humiliated temples and gods alike The Council of Orleans regarded suicide as a sin more grievous than murder for the murderer can always repent be saved whereas the man who has taken his own life has passed beyond the limits of salvation But the act of suicide originates in a radical formula of salvation Is not nothingness the equal of eternity The solitary being has no need to declare war on the universe he sends the ultimatum to himself He no longer aspires to be forever if in an incomparable action he has been absolutely himself He rejects heaven and earth as he rejects himself At least he will have achieved a plenitude of freedom inaccessible to the man who keeps looking for it in the future    No church no civil institution has as yet invented a single argument valid against suicide What answer is there to the man who can no longer endure life No one is qualified to take another s burdens upon himself And what power does dialectic have against the assault of irrefutable despairs and against a thousand unconsoled manifestations Suicide is one of man s distinctive characteristics one of his discoveries no animal is capable of it and the angels have scarcely guessed its existence without it human reality would be less curious less picturesque we should lack a strange climate and a series of deadly possibilities which have their aesthetic value if only to introduce into tragedy certain new solutions and a variety of denouements The sages of antiquity who put themselves to death as a proof of their maturity had created a discipline of suicide which the moderns have unlearned Doomed to an uninspired agony we are neither authors of our extremities nor arbiters of our adieux the end is no longer our end we lack the excellence of a unique initiative by which we might ransom an insipid and talentless life as we lack the sublime cynicism the ancient splendor of an art of dying Habitues of despair complacent corpses we all outlive ourselves and die only to fulfill a futile formality It is as if our life were attached to itself only to postpone the moment when we could get rid of it The Reactionary Angels It is difficult to sit in judgment on the revolt of the least philosophical of the angels without a tinge of sympathy amazement and    blame Injustice governs the universe Everything which is done and undone there bears the stamp of a filthy fragility as if matter were the fruit of a scandal at the core of nothingness Each being feeds on the agony of some other the moments rush like vampires upon time s anemia the world is a receptacle of sobs    In this slaughterhouse to fold one s arms or to draw one s sword are equally vain gestures No proud frenzy can shake space to its foundations or ennoble men s souls Triumphs and failures follow one another according to an unknown law named destiny a name to which we resort when philosophically unprovided for our sojourn here on earth or anywhere seems insoluble to us a kind of curse to endure senseless and undeserved Destiny favorite word in the vocabulary of the vanquished    Greedy for a nomenclature of the Irremediable we seek relief in verbal invention in lights suspended over our disasters Words are charitable their frail reality deceives and consoles us    Thus destiny which can will nothing is what has willed what happens to us    Infatuated with the Irrational as the sole mode of explanation we watch it tip the scale of our fate which weighs only negative elements Where find the pride to provoke the forces which have so decreed and what is more are not to be held responsible for this decree Against whom wage the struggle and where lead the assault when injustice haunts the air of our lungs the space of our thoughts the silence and the stupor of the stars Our revolt is as ill conceived as the world which provokes it How take it on ourselves to right wrongs when like Don Quixote on his deathbed we have lost madness at its end exhausted vigor and illusion to confront the highroads combats and defeats And how regain the energy of that seditious angel who still at time s start knew nothing of that pestilential wisdom in which our impulses asphyxiate Where find enough verve and presumption to stigmatize the herd of the other angels while here on earth to follow their colleague is to cast oneself still lower while men s injustice imitates God s and all rebellion sets the soul against infinity and breaks it there The anonymous angels huddled under their ageless wings eternally victors and vanquished in God numb to the deadly curiosities dreamers parallel to the earthly griefs who would dare to cast the first stone at them and in defiance divide their sleep Revolt the pride of downfall takes its nobility only from its uselessness sufferings awaken it and then abandon it frenzy exalts it and disappointment denies it    Revolt cannot have a meaning in a nonvalid universe    In this world nothing is in its place beginning with this world itself We must therefore not be surprised by the spectacle of human injustice It is equally futile to refuse or to accept the social order we must endure its changes for the better or the worse with a despairing conformism as we endure birth love the weather and death Decomposition presides over the laws of life closer to our dust than inanimate objects to theirs we succumb before them and rash upon our destiny under the gaze of the apparently indestructible stars But they themselves will crumble in a universe which only our heart takes seriously later expiating its lack of irony by terrible lacerations    No one can correct God s injustice or that of men every action is merely a special apparently organized case of the original Chaos We are swept on by a whirlwind which dates back to the dawn of time and if this whirlwind has assumed the aspect of an order it is only the better to do away with us    The Concern for Decency Under the goad of pain the flesh awakens lucid and lyrical substance it sings its dissolution So long as it was indistinguishable from nature it rested in the oblivion of elements the self had not yet seized upon it Suffering matter frees itself from gravitation no longer participates in the universe isolates itself from the somnolent sum for pain an agent of separation the active principle of individuation denies the pleasures of a statistical destiny The truly solitary being is not the man who is abandoned by men but the man who suffers in their midst who drags his desert through the marketplace and deploys his talents as a smiling leper a mountebank of the irreparable The great solitaries were happy in the old days knew nothing of duplicity had nothing to hide they conversed only with their own solitude    Of all the bonds which link us to things there is not one which fails to slacken and dissolve under the influence of suffering which frees us from everything except the obsession of ourselves and the sensation of being irrevocably individual Suffering is solitude hypostatized as essence By what means then communicate with others except by the prestidigitation of lying For if we were not jugglers if we had not learned the artifices of a knowing charlatanism if indeed we were sincere to the point of shamelessness or tragedy our underground worlds would vomit up oceans of gall in which it would be a point of honor for us to vanish thereby we should flee the unseemliness of so much grotesquerie and sublimity At a certain degree of misery all frankness becomes indecent Job stopped just in time one step further and neither God nor his friends would have answered him again One is civilized insofar as one does not proclaim one s leprosy as one evinces respect for the elegant falsehoods forged by the ages No one is entitled to stagger under the burden of his hours    every man harbors a possibility of apocalypse but every man makes it a rule to level his own abysses If each of us gave free rein to his solitude God would have to remake the world whose existence depends at every point on our education and on this fear we have of ourselves   Chaos Chaos is rejecting all you have learned chaos is being yourself   Gamut of the Void I have seen one man pursue this goal another that one I have seen men fascinated by disparate objects under the spell of dreams and plans at once vile and indefinable Analyzing each case in isolation in order to penetrate the reasons for so much fervor squandered I have realized the nonmeaning of all action and all effort Is there a single life which is not impregnated with lifegiving errors a single clear transparent life without humiliating roots without invented motives without myths emerging from desires Where is the action pure of all utility sun abhorring incandescence angel in a universe without faith or idle worm in a world abandoned to immortality I have tried to protect myself against men to react against their madness to discern its source I have listened and I have seen and I have been afraid afraid of acting for the same motives or for any motive whatever of believing in the same ghosts or in any other ghost of letting myself be engulfed by die same intoxications or by some other    afraid in short of raving in common and of expiring in a horde of ecstasies I knew that by separating from someone I was dispossessed of a fallacy I was deprived of the illusion I was loving him    His feverish words revealed him the captive of an evidence absolute for him and absurd for me on contact with his vacuity I stripped myself of mine    Whom can we adhere to without the feeling of deception without blushing We can justify only the man who practices in full awareness the irrational necessary to every action and who embellishes with no dream the fiction to which he surrenders himself as we can admire only a hero who dies without conviction all the more ready for sacrifice in that he has seen through it As for lovers they would be hateful if among their grimaces the presentiment of death did not hover caressing    It is disturbing to think that we carry our secret our illusion into the grave that we have not survived the mysterious mistake that vivified our every breath that except for the skeptics and whores among us all founder in falsehood because they fail to divine the equivalence in nullity of triumphs and truths I wanted to suppress in myself the reasons men invoke in order to exist in order to act I wanted to become unspeakably normal and here I am in dazed confusion on a footing with fools and as empty as they Certain Mornings Regret not to be Atlas not to be able to shrug my shoulders and watch the collapse of this laughable matter    Rage takes the opposite path of cosmogony By what mysteries do we wake certain mornings with the thirst to demolish the whole of creation inert and animate alike When the devil drowns himself in our veins when our ideas turn convulsive and our desires cleave the light the elements catch fire and consume themselves while our fingers sift their ashes What nightmares have we sustained for nights on end to wake up in the mornings enemies of the sun Must we liquidate ourselves to put an end to everything What complicity what bonds extend us into an intimacy with time Life would be intolerable without the forces which deny it Masters of a possible exit of the idea of an escape we might readily abolish ourselves and at the apex of delirium expectorate this universe    Or else pray and wait for other mornings To write would be an insipid and superfluous action if we could weep at will imitating women and children in their fits of rage    In the substance of which we are made in its deepest impurity abides a principle of bitterness which only tears can sweeten If each time disappointments assail us we had the possibility to be released from them by tears all vague maladies and poetry itself would disappear But a native reticence aggravated by education or a defective functioning of the lachrymal glands dooms us to the martyrdom of dry eyes And then shrieks storms of swearing selfmaceration and fingernails furrowing the flesh with the consolations of a spectacle of blood no longer figure among our therapeutic methods It follows that we are all sick and that each of us would require a Sahara in order to scream our lungs out or the shores of a wild and elegiac sea in order to mingle with its fierce lamentations our even fiercer ones Our paroxysms require the context of a parodic sublimity of an apoplectic infinity the vision of a hanging where the firmament would serve as a gallows to our carcasses and to the elements Militant Mourning All truths are against us But we go on living because we accept them in themselves because we refuse to draw the consequences Where is the man who has translated in his behavior a single conclusion of the lessons of astronomy of biology and who has decided never to leave his bed again out of rebellion or humility in the face of the sidereal distances or the natural phenomena Has pride ever been conquered by the evidence of our unreality And who was ever bold enough to do nothing because every action is senseless in infinity The sciences prove our nothingness But who has grasped their ultimate teaching Who has become a hero of total sloth No one folds his arms we are busier than the ants and the bees Yet if an ant if a bee by the miracle of an idea or by some temptation of singularity were to isolate herself in the anthill or the hive if she contemplated from outside the spectacle of her labors would she still persist in her pains Only the rational animal has been able to learn nothing from his philosophy he locates himself apart and perseveres nonetheless in the same errors of effective appearance and void reality Seen from outside from any Archimedean point life with all its beliefs is no longer possible nor even conceivable We can act only against the truth Man starts over again every day in spite of everything he knows against everything he knows He has extended this ambiguity to the point of vice perspicacity is in mourning but strange contagion this very mourning is active thus we are led into a funeral procession to the Last Judgment thus out of the ultimate rest itself out of history s final silence we have made an activity the staging of the agony the need for dynamism even in the deathrattles    The panting civilizations exhaust themselves faster than those that loll in eternity China alone thriving for millennia in the flower of her old age offers an example to be followed China alone long since arrived at a refined wisdom superior to philosophy Taoism surpasses all the mind has conceived by way of detachment We count by generations it is the curse of scarcely centuryold civilizations to have lost in their rushed cadence the atemporal consciousness By all evidence we are in the world to do nothing but instead of nonchalantly promenading our corruption we exude our sweat and grow winded upon the fetid air All History is in a state of putrefaction its odors shift toward the future we rush toward it if only for the fever inherent in any decomposition It is too late for humanity to be released from the illusion of action it is especially too late for it to be raised to the sanctity of sloth Immunity to Renunciation Everything which deals with eternity inevitably turns into a commonplace The world ends by accepting any revelation and resigns itself to any shudder provided that a formula is found for it The notion of universal futility more dangerous than any scourge has been debased into the obvious everyone acknowledges as much and no one behaves accordingly The terror of an ultimate truth has been tamed once it turns into a refrain men no longer think about it for they have learned by heart a thing which merely glimpsed should cast them into the abyss or salvation The vision of Time s nullity has begotten saints and poets and the despairs of a few solitaries infatuated with anathema    This vision is no news to the crowd the crowd continually asks what s the use what does it matter it s not the first time plus ca change    and yet nothing happens nothing intervenes not one saint not one poet more   If the crowd conformed to a single one of these refrains the face of the world would be transformed But eternity appearing from an antivital thought cannot be a human reflex without danger for the performance of actions it becomes a commonplace so that we can forget it by a mechanical repetition Sanctity is a risk like poetry Men say everything passes but how many grasp the bearing of this terrifying banality How many flee life celebrate or bewail it Who is not imbued with the conviction that all is vanity But who dares confront the consequences The man with a metaphysical vocation is rarer than a monster and yet each man contains the potential elements of this vocation It was enough for one Hindu prince to see a cripple an old man and a corpse to understand everything we see them and understand nothing for nothing changes in our life We cannot renounce anything yet the evidences of vanity are in our reach Invalids of hope we are still waiting and life is only the hypostatization of waiting We wait for everything even Nothingness rather than be reduced to an eternal suspension to a condition of neutral divinity of a corpse Thus the heart which has made the Irreparable into an axiom still hopes for surprises from it Humanity lives in love with the events which deny it    The World s Equilibrium The apparent symmetry of joys and pains has nothing to do with their equitable distribution it results from the injustice which strikes certain individuals thereby forcing them to compensate by their despondency for the others unconcern To endure the consequences of their actions or to be saved from them such is the lot of men This discrimination is effected without any criterion it is a fatality an absurd apportionment a fantastic selection No one can elude the condemnation to happiness or misery nor the innate sentence at the preposterous tribunal whose decision extends between the spermatozoon and the sepulcher Some men pay for all their joys expiate all their pleasures are accountable for all their intervals of oblivion they will never be indebted for a single moment of happiness For them a thousand acrimonies have crowned a shudder of pleasure as if they had no right to acknowledged contentments as if their abandonment endangered the world s bestial equilibrium    Were they happy in some landscape they will regret it in imminent disappointments were they proud in their plans and their dreams they will soon wake as from a utopia corrected by alltoopositive sufferings Thus there are sacrificed men who pay for the unconsciousness of others who expiate not only their own happiness but that of strangers Thus equilibrium is restored the proportion of joys and pains becomes harmonious If an obscure universal principle has decreed that you belong to the order of victims you will end your days stamping underfoot the speck of paradise you hid within yourself and whatever impulse gleamed in your eyes and your dreams will be sullied by the impurity of time matter and men You will have a dungheap for pedestal for tribune a rack and thumb screw You will be worthy of no more than a leprous glory and a crown of spit Try to walk beside those entitled to everything to whom all paths are open But dust and ashes themselves will rise up to bar you from the exits of time and the evasions of dreams Whatever direction you take your steps will be mired your voices will proclaim only the hymns of mud and over your bent heads your heavy hearts in which only selfpity dwells will pass no more than the breath of the happy blessed toys of a nameless irony as little to blame as you are Farewell to Philosophy I turned away from philosophy when it became impossible to discover in Kant any human weakness any authentic accent of melancholy in Kant and in all the philosophers Compared to music mysticism and poetry philosophical activity proceeds from a diminished impulse and a suspect depth prestigious only for the timid and the tepid Moreover philosophy impersonal anxiety refuge among anemic ideas is the recourse of all who would elude the corrupting exuberance of life Almost all the philosophers came to a good end that is the supreme argument against philosophy Even Socrates death has nothing tragic about it it is a misunderstanding the end of a pedagogue and if Nietzsche foundered it was as a poet and visionary he expiated his ecstasies and not his arguments We cannot elude existence by explanations we can only endure it love or hate it adore or dread it in that alternation of happiness and horror which expresses the very rhythm of being its oscillations its dissonances its bright or bitter vehemences Exposed by surprise or necessity to an irrefutable defeat who does not raise his hands in prayer then only to let them fall emptier still for the answers of philosophy It would seem that its mission is to protect us as long as fate s neglect allows us to proceed on the brink of chaos and to abandon us as soon as we are forced to plunge over the edge And how could it be otherwise when we see how little of humanity s suffering has passed into its philosophy The philosophic exercise is not fruitful it is merely honorable We are always philosophers with impunity a metier without fate which pours voluminous thoughts into our neutral and vacant hours the hours refractory to the Old Testament to Bach and to Shakespeare And have these thoughts materialized into a single page that is equivalent to one of Job s exclamations of Macbeth s terrors or the altitude of one of Bach s cantatas We do not argue the universe we express it And philosophy does not express it The real problems begin only after having ranged or exhausted it after the last chapter of a huge tome which prints the final period as an abdication before the Unknown in which all our moments are rooted and with which we must struggle because it is naturally more immediate more important than our daily bread Here the philosopher leaves us enemy of disaster he is sane as reason itself and as prudent And we remain in the company of an old plague victim of a poet learned in every lunacy and of a musician whose sublimity transcends the sphere of the heart We begin to Eve authentically only where philosophy ends at its wreck when we have understood its terrible nullity when we have understood that it was futile to resort to it that it is no help The great systems are actually no more than brilliant tautologies What advantage is it to know that the nature of being consists in the will to live in idea or in the whim of God or of Chemistry A mere proliferation of words subtle displacements of meanings What is loathes the verbal embrace and our inmost experience reveals us nothing beyond the privileged and inexpressible moment Moreover Being itself is only a pretension of Nothingness We define only out of despair We must have a formula we must even have many if only to give justification to the mind and a facade to the void Neither concept nor ecstasy are functional When music plunges us into the inwardness of being we rapidly return to the surface the effects of the illusion scatter and our knowledge admits its nullity The things we touch and those we conceive are as improbable as our senses and our reason we are sure only in our verbal universe manageable at will and ineffectual Being is mute and the mind is garrulous This is called knowing The philosopher s originality comes down to inventing terms Since there are only three or four attitudes by which to confront the world and about as many ways of dying the nuances which multiply and diversify them derive from no more than the choice of words bereft of any metaphysical range We are engulfed in a pleonastic universe in which the questions and answers amount to the same thing Front Saint to Cynic Mockery has degraded everything to the rank of a pretext except for the Sun and Hope except for the two conditions of life the world s center and the heart s the one dazzling the other invisible A skeleton warming in the sun and hoping would be more vigorous than a despairing Hercules weary of the light a Being totally permeable to Hope would be more powerful than God and more vital than Life Macbeth aweary of the sun is the last of creatures true death not being corruption but the disgust with our irradiation the repulsion for all that is a seed for all that grows in the warmth of illusion Man has profaned the things which are born and die under the sun except for the sun the things which are born and die in hope except for hope Not having had the courage to go further he has imposed limits upon his cynicism A cynic who claims to be consistent is a cynic in words only his gestures make him the most contradictory being no one can live after having decimated his superstitions To reach total cynicism would require an effort which is the converse of sanctity s and at least as considerable or else imagine a saint who having reached the pinnacle of his purification discovers the vanity of the trouble he has taken and the absurdity of God    Such a monster of lucidity would change the data of life he would have the strength and the authority to question the very conditions of his existence he would no longer be in danger of contradicting himself no human failing would then weaken his audacities having lost the religious respect we pay despite ourselves to our last illusions he would make a plaything of his heart and of the sun    Return to the Elements If philosophy had made no progress since the preSocratics there would be no reason to complain Exhausted by the jumble of concepts we end by realizing that our life is still lived out in the elements out of which they constituted the world that it is the earth fire air and water which condition us that this rudimentary physics reveals the context of our ordeals and the principle of our torments Having complicated these few elementary data we have lost fascinated by the decor and the structure of our theories the understanding of Destiny which nonetheless unchanged is the same as on the world s first day Our existence reduced to its essence continues to be a struggle against the eternal elements a struggle which our knowledge in no way alleviates The heroes of every epoch are no less wretched than those of Homer and if they have become characters it is by losing vitality and greatness How could the results of the sciences change man s metaphysical position And what are the explorations of matter the discoveries and the products of analysis beside the vedic hymns and those melancholies of historic dawn which crept into the world s anonymous poetry Since the most eloquent decadences edify us no further as to unhappiness than the stammerings of a shepherd and ultimately there is more wisdom in the mockery of an idiot than in the investigations of the laboratories is it not madness to pursue truth on the paths of time or in books Laotse reduced to a few texts is not more naive than we who have read everything Profundity is independent of knowledge We translate to other levels the revelations of the ages or we exploit original intuitions by the latest acquisitions of thought Thus Hegel is a Heraclitus who has read Kant and our Ennui is an affective Eleaticism the fiction of diversity unmasked and exposed to the heart    Subterfuges Only those who live outside of art draw the ultimate consequences Suicide sanctity vice so many forms of lack of talent Direct or disguised confession by word sound or color halts the agglomeration of inner forces and weakens them by projecting them back toward the world outside It is a salutary diminution which makes every act of creation into a coefficient of escape But the man who accumulates energies lives under pressure a slave to his own excesses nothing keeps him from foundering in the absolute    Authentic tragic existence is almost never to be found among those who know how to manage the secret powers which exhaust them diminishing their soul by their work where would they find the energy to attain to the extremity of actions A hero is fulfilled in a proud modality of dying because he lacked the faculty of gradually extinguishing himself in verse All heroism expiates by the genius of the heart a defaulting talent every hero is a being without talent And it is this deficiency which projects him forward and enriches him while those who have by creation impoverished their inheritance of the unspeakable are cast as existences into the background though their minds can be raised above all the rest A man eliminates himself from the rank of his kind by the monastery or some other artifice by morphine masturbation or rum whereas a form of expression might have saved him But always present to himself perfect possessor of his reserves and his mistakes bearing the sum of his life without the possibility of diminishing it by the pretexts of art invaded by self he can be only total in his gestures and his resolutions he can draw only a conclusion affecting him altogether he cannot relish the extremes he is drowned in them and he actually drowns in vice in God or in his own blood whereas the cowardices of expression would have made him retreat before the supreme The man who expresses himself does not act against himself he knows only the temptation of ultimate consequences And the deserter is not the man who draws them but the man who scatters and divulges himself for fear lest surrendered to himself he will be ruined and wrecked NonResistance to Night At first we think we advance toward the light then wearied by an aimless march we lose our way the earth less and less secure no longer supports us it opens under our feet Vainly we should try to follow a path toward a sunlit goal the shadows mount within and below us No gleam to slow our descent the abyss summons us and we lend an ear Above still remains all we wanted to be all that has not had the power to raise us higher And we once in love with the peaks then disappointed by them we end by fondling our fall we hurry to fulfill it instruments of a strange execution fascinated by the illusion of reaching the limits of the darkness the frontiers of our nocturnal fate Fear of the void transformed into a kind of voluptuous joy what luck to gainsay the sun Infinity in reverse god that begins beneath our heels ecstasy before the crevices of being and thirst for a black halo the Void is an inverted dream in which we are engulfed If delirium becomes our law let us wear a subterranean nimbus a crown in our fall Dethroned from this world let us carry its scepter in order to honor the night with a new splendor And yet this fall but for some moments of posturing is far from being solemn and lyric Habitually we sink into a nocturnal mud into a darkness quite as mediocre as the light    Life is merely a torpor in chiaroscuro an inertia among the gleams and shadows a caricature of that inward sun which makes us believe illegitimately in our eminence over the rest of matter Nothing proves that we are more than nothing In order to experience that continual expansion in which we rival the gods in which our fevers triumph over our fears we should have to remain at so high a temperature that it would finish us off in a few days But our illuminations are instantaneous falls are our rule Life is what decomposes at every moment it is a monotonous loss of light an insipid dissolution in the darkness without scepters without halos    Turning a Cold Shoulder to Time Yesterday today tomorrow these are servants categories For the idle man sumptuously settled in the Inconsolable and whom every moment torments past present and future are merely variable appearances of one and the same disease identical in its substance inexorable in its insinuation and monotonous in its persistence And this disease is coextensive with Being it is Being I was I am or I shall be a question of grammar and not of existence Fate as a carnival of chronos lends itself to conjugation but stripped of its masks is revealed to be as motionless and naked as an epitaph How can we grant more importance to the hour which is than to the one which was or which will be The contempt in which servants live and every man who adheres to time is a servant represents a true state of grace an enchanted obscuration and this contempt like a supernatural veil covers the damnation to which every action engendered by desire is exposed But for the disabused man of leisure the pure fact of living living pure of all praxis is a task so wearying that to endure existence as such seems to him an excessive occupation an exhausting career and every gesture inordinate impracticable and repealed TwoFaced Freedom Though the problem of freedom is insoluble we can always argue about it always side with contingency or necessity    Our temperaments and our prejudices facilitate an option which cuts short and simplifies the problem without solving it Whereas no theoretical construction manages to make it apparent to us to make us experience its dense and contradictory reality a privileged intuition puts us at the very heart of freedom despite all the arguments invented against it And we are afraid we are afraid of the enormity of the possible not being prepared for a revelation so huge and so sudden for that dangerous benefit to which we aspired and before which we retreat What shall we do accustomed to chains and laws in the face of an infinity of initiatives of a debauch of decisions The seduction of the arbitrary alarms us If we can begin any action if there are no limits to inspiration and to our whims how avoid our ruin in the intoxication of so much power Consciousness shaken by this revelation interrogates itself and trembles Who in a world where he can do anything has not been dizzied The murderer makes a Iimitless use of his freedom and cannot resist the notion of his power It is within the capacities of each one of us to take another s life If all those we have killed in thought were to disappear for good the earth would be depopulated We bear within us a reticent executioner an unrealized criminal And those who lack the boldness to acknowledge their homicidal tendencies murder in dreams people their nightmares with corpses Before an absolute tribunal only the angels would be acquitted For there has never been a human being who has not at least unconsciously desired the death of another human being Each of us drags after him a cemetery of friends and enemies and it matters little whether this graveyard is relegated to the heart s abyss or projected to the surface of our desires Freedom conceived in its ultimate implications raises the question of our life or of others lives it involves the dual possibility of saving or destroying us But we feel free we understand our opportunities and our dangers only by fits and starts And it is the intermittence of these fits and starts their rarity which explains why this world is no more than a mediocre slaughterhouse and a Active paradise To argue about freedom leads to no consequence in good or evil but we have only moments to realize that everything depends on us    Freedom is an ethical principle of demonic essence Overworked by Dreams If we could conserve the energy we lavish in that series of dreams we nightly leave behind us the mind s depth and subtlety would reach unimaginable proportions The scaffolding of a nightmare requires a nervous expenditure more exhausting than the best articulated theoretical construction How after waking begin again the task of aligning ideas when in our unconscious we were mixed up with grotesque and marvelous spectacles we were sailing among the spheres without the shackles of antipoetic Causality For hours we were like drunken gods and suddenly our open eyes erasing night s infinity we must resume in day s mediocrity the enterprise of insipid problems without any of the night s hallucinations to help us The glorious and deadly fantasy was all for nothing then sleep has exhausted us in vain Waking another kind of weariness awaits us after having had just time enough to forget the night s we are at grips with the dawn s We have labored hours and hours in horizontal immobility without our brain s deriving the least advantage of its absurd activity An imbecile who was not victimized by this waste who might accumulate all his resources without dissipating them in dreams would be able owner of an ideal state of waking to disentangle all the snags of the metaphysical lies or initiate himself into the most inextricable difficulties of mathematics After each night we are emptier our mysteries and our griefs have leaked away into our dreams Thus sleep s labor not only diminishes the power of our thought but even that of our secrets    The Model Traitor Since life can be fulfilled only within individuation that last bastion of solitude each being is necessary alone by the fact that he is an individual Yet all individuals are not alone in the same way nor with the same intensity each occupies a different rank in the hierarchy of solitude at one extreme stands the traitor he is an individual to the point of exasperation In this sense Judas is the loneliest being in the history of Christianity but not in the history of solitude He betrayed only a god he knew what he betrayed he betrayed someone as so many others betray something a country or other more or less collective pretexts The betrayal which focuses on a specific object even if it involves dishonor or death is not at all mysterious we always have the image of what we want to destroy guilt is clear whether admitted or denied The others cast you out and you resign yourself to the cell or the guillotine    But there exists a much more complex modality of betrayal without immediate reference without relation to an object or a person Thus to abandon everything without knowing what this everything represents to isolate yourself from your milieu to reject by a metaphysical divorce the substance which has molded you which surrounds you and which carries you Who and by what defiance can challenge existence with impunity Who and by what efforts can achieve a liquidation of the very principle of his own breath Yet the will to undermine the foundations of all that exists produces a craving for negative effectiveness powerful and ineffable as a whiff of remorse corrupting the young vitality of a hope   When you have betrayed being you bear with you only a vague discomfort there is no image sustaining the object which provokes the sensation of infamy No one casts the first stone you are a respectable citizen as before you enjoy the honors of the city the consideration of your kind the laws protect you you are as estimable as anyone else and yet no one sees that you are living your funeral in advance and that your death can add nothing to your irremediably established condition This is because the traitor to existence is accountable only to himself Who else can ask him for an accounting If you denounce neither a man nor an institution you run no risk no law protects Reality but all of them punish you for the merest prejudice against its appearances You are entitled to sap Being itself but no human being you may legally demolish the foundations of all that is but prison or death awaits your least infringement of individual powers Nothing protects Existence there is no case against metaphysical traitors against the Buddhas who reject salvation for we judge them traitors only to their own lives Yet of all malefactors these are the most harmful they do not attack the fruit but the very sap of the universe Their punishment They alone know what it is    It may be that in every traitor there is a thirst for opprobrium and that his choice of betrayal depends on the degree of solitude he aspires to Who has not experienced the desire to perpetrate an incomparable crime which would exclude him from the human race Who has not coveted ignominy in order to sever for good the links which attach him to others to suffer a condemnation without appeal and thereby to reach the peace of the abyss And when we break with the universe is it not for the calm of an unpardonable crime A Judas with the soul of a Buddha what a model for a coming and concluding humanity In One of the Earth s Attics I have dreamed of distant springs of a sun shining on nothing but seafoam and the oblivion of my birth of a sun opposed to the earth and to this disease of finding nothing anywhere but the desire to be somewhere else The earthly fate who has inflicted it upon us who has chained us to this morose matter a petrified tear against which born of time our tears shatter whereas it has fallen immemorial from God s first shudder I have loathed the planet s noons and midnights I have longed for a world without weather without hours and the fear that swells them I have hated the sighs of mortals under the weight of ages Where is the moment without end and without desire and that primal vacancy insensitive to the presentiments of disaster and of life I have sought for the geography of Nothingness of unknown seas and another sun pure of the scandal of lifebearing rays  have sought for the rocking of a skeptical ocean in which islands and axioms are drowned the vast liquid narcotic tepid and sweet and tired of knowledge    This earth sin of the Creator Bet I no longer want to expiate others sins I want to be cured of my begetting in an agony outside the continents in some fluid desert in an impersonal shipwreck Indefinite Horror It is not the outbreak of a specific evil which reminds us of our fragility there are vaguer but more troublesome warnings to signify our imminent excommunication from the temporal The approach of disgust of that sensation which physiologically separates us from the world shows how destructible is the solidity of our instincts or the consistency of our attachments In health our flesh echoes the universal pulsation and our blood reproduces its cadence in disgust which lies in wait for us like a potential hell in order to suddenly seize upon us afterwards we are as isolated in the whole as a monster imagined by some teratology of solitude The critical point of our vitality is not disease which is struggle but that indefinite horror which rejects everything and strips our desires of the power to procreate new mistakes The senses lose their sap the veins dry up and the organs no longer perceive anything but the interval separating them from their own functions Everything turns insipid provender and dreams No more aroma in matter and no more enigma in meditation gastronomy and metaphysics both become victims of our want of appetite We spend hours waiting for other hours waiting for the moments which no longer flee time the faithful moments which reinstate us in the mediocrity of health    and the amnesia of its dangers Greed for space unconscious covetousness of the future health shows us how superficial the level of life is as such and how incompatible organic equilibrium is with inner depth The mind in its range proceeds from our compromised functions it takes wing insofar as the void dilates within our organs We are healthy only insofar as we are not specifically ourselves it is our disgusts which individualize us our melancholies which grant us a name our losses which make us possessors of our    self We are ourselves only by the sum of our failures Unconscious Dogmas We are in a position to penetrate someone s mistake to show him the inanity of his plans and intentions but how wrest him from his persistence in time when he conceals a fanaticism as inveterate as his instincts as old as his prejudices We bear within us like an unchallengeable treasure an amalgam of unworthy beliefs and certitudes And even the man who manages to rid himself of them to vanquish them remains in the desert of his lucidity a fanatic still a fanatic of himself of his own existence he has scoured all his obsessions except for the terrain where they flourish he has lost all his fixed points except for the fixity from which they proceed Life has dogmas more immutable than theology each existence being anchored in infallibilities which exceed all the lucubrations of madness or of faith Even the skeptic in love with his doubts turns out to be a fanatic of skepticism Man is the dogmatic being par excellence and his dogmas are all the deeper when he does not formulate them when he is unaware of them and when he follows them We all believe in many more things than we think we harbor intolerances we cherish bloody prejudices and defending our ideas with extreme means we travel the world like ambulatory and irrefragable fortresses Each of us is a supreme dogma to himself no theology protects its god as we protect our self and if we assail this self with doubts and call it into question we do so only by a pseudoelegance of our pride the case is already won How escape the absolute of oneself One would have to imagine a being without instincts without a name and to whom his own image would be unknown But everything in the world gives us back our own features night itself is never dark enough to keep us from being reflected in it Too present to ourselves our nonexistence before birth and after death influences us only as a notion and only for a few moments we experience the fever of our duration as an eternity which falters but which nonetheless remains unexhaustible in its principle The man who does not adore himself is yet to be born Everything that lives loves itself if not what would be the source of the dread which breaks out in the depths and on the surfaces of life Each of us is for himself the one fixed point in the universe And if someone dies for an idea it is because it is his idea and his idea is his life No critique of any kind of reason will waken man from his dogmatic sleep It may shake the unconscious certitudes which abound in his philosophy and substitute more flexible propositions for his rigid affirmations but how by a rational procedure will it manage to shake the creature huddled over its own dogmas without bringing about its very death Duality There is a vulgarity which makes us admit anything in this world but which is not powerful enough to make us admit this world itself Hence we can endure life s miseries even as we repudiate Life let ourselves be swept away by the frenzies of desire even as we reject Desire In the assent to existence there is a kind of baseness which we escape by means of our prides and our regrets but particularly by means of the melancholy which keeps us from sliding into a final affirmation wrested from our cowardice Is anything viler than to say yes to the world And yet we keep multiplying that consent that trivial repetition that loyalty oath to life denied only by everything in us that rejects vulgarity We can live the way the others do and yet conceal a  W greater than the world that is melancholy s infinity    We can love only the beings who do not exceed the minimum of vulgarity indispensable for life itself Yet it would be difficult to delimit the quantity of such vulgarity especially since no action can do without it All of life s rejects prove that they were insufficiently sordid    The man who prevails in the conflict with his neighbors stands on top of a dungheap and the man who is vanquished there pays for a purity he has been unwilling to sully In every man nothing is more alive and true than his own vulgarity source of all that is vital in elemental terms But on the other hand the more deeply rooted you are in life the more contemptible you are The man who does not spread a vague funereal radiation around himself and who in passing fails to leave a whiff of melancholy from remote worlds that man belongs to subzoology more specifically to human history The opposition between vulgarity and melancholy is so irreducible that next to it all other oppositions seem to be inventions of the mind arbitrary and entertaining even the most decisive antimonies blur beside this opposition in which are brought face to face according to a predestined dosage our lower depths and our dreaming gall The Renegade He remembers being born somewhere having believed in native errors having proposed principles and preached inflammatory stupidities He blushes for it    and strives to abjure his past his real or imaginary fatherlands the truths generated in his very marrow He will find peace only after having annihilated in himself the last reflex of the citizen the last inherited enthusiasm How could the heart s habits still chain him when he seeks liberation from genealogies and when even the ideal of the ancient sage scorner of all cities seems to him a compromise The man who can no longer take sides because all men are necessarily right and wrong because everything is at once justified and irrational that man must renounce his own name tread his identity underfoot and begin a new life in impassibility or despair Or otherwise invent another genre of solitude expatriate himself in the void and pursue by means of one exile or another the stages of uprootedness Released from all prejudices he becomes the unusable man par excellence to whom no one turns and whom no one fears because he admits and repudiates everything with the same detachment Less dangerous than a heedless insect he is nonetheless a scourge for Life for it has vanished from his vocabulary with the seven days of the Creation And Life would forgive him if at least he relished Chaos which is where Life began But he denies the feverish origins beginning with his own and preserves with regard to the world only a cold memory a polite regret From denial to denial his existence is diminished vaguer and more unreal than a syllogism of sighs how could he still be a creature of flesh and blood Anemic he rivals the Idea itself he has abstracted himself from his ancestors from his friends from every soul and himself in his veins once turbulent rests a light from another world Liberated from what he has lived unconcerned by what he will live he demolishes the signposts on all his roads and wrests himself from the dials of all time I shall never meet myself again he decides happy to turn his last hatred against himself happier still to annihilate in his forgiveness all beings all things Shades of the Future We are justified in imagining a time when we shall have transcended everything even music even poetry a time when detractors of our traditions and our transports we shall achieve such a disavowal of ourselves that weary of a known grave we shall make our way through the days in a threadbare shroud When a sonnet whose rigor raises the verbal world above a splendidly imagined cosmos when a sonnet ceases to be a temptation for our tears and when in the middle of a sonata our yawns win out over our emotion then the graveyards will have nothing more to do with us for they receive only fresh corpses still imbued with a suspicion of warmth and a memory of life Before our old age a time will come when retracing our ardors and bent beneath the recantations of the flesh we shall walk halfcarrion halfspecter    We shall have repressed out of fear of complicity with illusion any palpitation within us Unable to have disembodied our life in a sonnet we shall drag our corruption in shreds and tatters and for having outstripped music and death alike we shall stumble blind toward a funereal immortality    The Flower of Fixed Ideas So long as man is protected by madness he functions and flourishes but when he frees himself from the fruitful tyranny of fixed ideas he is lost ruined He begins to accept everything to wrap not only minor abuses in his tolerance but crimes and monstrosities vices and aberrations everything is worth the same to him His indulgence selfdestroying as it is extends to all the guilty to the victims and the executioners he takes all sides because he espouses all opinions gelatinous contaminated by infinity he has lost his character lacking any point of reference any obsession The universal view melts things into a blur and the man who still makes them out being neither their friend nor their enemy bears in himself a wax heart which indiscriminately takes the form of objects and beings His pity is addressed to    existence and his charity is that of doubt and not that of love a skeptical charity consequence of knowledge which excuses all anomalies But the man who takes sides who lives in the folly of decision and choice is never charitable incapable of comprehending all points of view confined in the horizon of his desires and his principles he plunges into a hypnosis of the finite This is because creatures flourish only by turning their backs on the universal    To be something unconditional is always a form of madness from which life flower of fixed idea frees itself only to fade The Celestial Dog Unknowable what a man must lose to have the courage to confront the conventions unknowable what Diogenes lost to become the man who permitted himself everything who translated his innermost thoughts into actions with a supernatural insolence like some libidinous yet pure god of knowledge No one was so frank a limit case of sincerity and lucidity as well as an example of what we could be if education and hypocrisy did not rein in our desires and our gestures One day a man invited him into a richly furnished house saying be careful not to spit on the floor Diogenes who needed to spit spat in his face exclaiming that it was the only dirty place he could find where spitting was permitted Diogenes Laertius Who after being received by a rich man has not longed oceans of saliva to expectorate on all the owners of the earth And who has not swallowed his own spittle for fear of casting it in the face of some stout and respected thief We are all absurdly prudent and timid cynicism is not something we are taught in school Nor is pride Menippus in his work entitled The Virtue of Diogenes tells how he was captured and sold as a slave and that he was asked what he knew how to do Diogenes answered Command and shouted to the herald Ask who wants to buy a master The man who affronted Alexander and Plato who masturbated in the marketplace If only heaven let us rub our bellies too and that be enough to stave off hunger  the man of the famous cask and the famous lantern and who in his youth was a counterfeiter what higher dignity for a cynic  what must his experience have been of his neighbors Certainly our own yet with this difference that man was the sole substance of his reflection and his contempt Without suffering the falsifications of any ethic and any metaphysic he strove to strip man in order to show him to us nakeder and more abominable than any comedy any apocalypse has done Socrates gone mad Plato called him Socrates turned sincere is what he should have said Socrates renouncing the Good abjuring formulas and the City Socrates turning finally into a psychologist and nothing more But Socrates even sublime remains conventional he remains a master an edifying model Only Diogenes proposes nothing the basis of his attitude and of cynicism in its essence is determined by a testicular horror of the absurdity of being man The thinker who reflects without illusion upon human reality if he wants to remain within the world and if he eliminates mysticism as an escapehatch ends up with a vision in which are mingled wisdom bitterness and farce and if he chooses the marketplace as the site of his solitude he musters his verve in mocking his kind or in exhibiting his disgust a disgust which today with Christianity and the police we can no longer permit ourselves Two thousand years of oaths and codes have sweetened our bile moreover in a hurried world who would stop to answer our insolences to delight in our howls That the greatest connoisseur of human beings should have been nicknamd dog proves that man has never had the courage to accept his authentic image and that he has always rejected truths without accommodations Diogenes suppressed pose in himself What a monster in other men s eyes To have an honorable place in philosophy you must be an actor you must respect the play of ideas and exercise yourself over false problems In no case must man as such be your business Again according to Diogenes Laertius At the Olympic games when the herald proclaimed Dioxippus has vanquished men Diogenes answered He has vanquished only slaves men are my business And indeed he vanquished men as no one else has ever done with weapons more dreadful than those of conquerors though he owned only a broom the least proprietary of all beggars true saint of mockery By a lucky accident he was born before the Cross made its appearance Who knows if grafted on his detachment some unhealthy temptation of extrahuman risk might not have induced him to become an ordinary ascetic later canonized lost in the mass of the blessed and the maze of the calendar Then he would have gone mad he too the most profoundly normal of men since he was remote from all teaching and all doctrine The hideous countenance of man Diogenes was the only one to reveal that to us The merits of cynicism have been dimmed and downtrodden by a religion opposed to the evident But the moment has come to confront the truths of the Son of God with those of this celestial dog as a poet of his time called him Ambiguity of Genius All inspiration proceeds from a faculty of exaggeration lyricism and the whole world of metaphor would be a pitiable excitation without that rapture which dilates words until they burst When the elements or the dimensions of the cosmos seem too diminished to serve as terms of comparison for our conditions poetry needs in order to transcend its stage of virtuality and imminence only a little clarity in the flashes which prefigure and beget it No true inspiration fails to rise out of the anomaly of a soul vaster than the world    In the verbal conflagration of a Shakespeare and a Shelley we smell the ash of words backwash and effluvium of an impossible cosmogony The terms encroach upon each other as though none could attain the equivalent of the inner dilation this is the hernia of the image the transcendent rupture of poor words born of everyday use and miraculously raised to the heart s altitudes The truths of beauty are fed on exaggerations which upon the merest analysis turn out to be monstrous and meaningless Poetry demiurgical divagation of the vocabulary    Has charlatanism ever been more effectively combined with ecstasy Lying the wellspring of all tears such is the imposture of genius and the secret of art Trifles swollen to the heavens the improbable generator of a universe In every genius coexists a braggart and a god Idolatry of Disaster All that we build beyond raw existence all the many powers which give the world a physiognomy we owe to Misfortune architect of diversity intelligible instrument of our actions What its sphere fails to engross transcends us what meaning could an event have which fails to be overwhelming The Future awaits us in order to immolate us the mind records nothing but the fracture of existence now and the senses still vibrate only in the expectation of disaster    How avoid considering the fate of Chateaubriand s sister Lucile or of Karoline von Gunderode and murmuring with the former I shall fall into the sleep of death upon my destiny or gulping the latter s despair which plunged a dagger into her heart Apart from a few examples of exhaustive melancholy and a few unequaled suicides men are merely puppets stuffed with red globules in order to beget history and its grimaces When idolaters of disaster we make it the agent and the substance of Becoming we bathe in the limpidity of the prescribed fate in a dawn of catastrophes in a fruitful Gehenna    But when imagining we have exhausted it we fear we shall outlive it existence darkens and no longer becomes And we dread readapting ourselves to Hope    betraying our disaster betraying ourselves    The Demon He is there in the blood s inferno in the bitterness of each cell in the shudder of our nerves in those contrary prayers exhaled by hate everywhere where he makes out of horror his comfort Should I let him undermine my hours when as a meticulous accomplice of my destruction I could vomit up my hopes and desist from myself He shares murderous tenant my bed my oblivions and my insomnias to lose him my own loss is necessary And when you have only a body and a soul the one too heavy and the other too dim how bear as well an additional weight a further darkness How drag your way through a dark time I dream of a golden moment outside of Becoming a sunlit moment transcending the torment of the organs and the melody of their decomposition To hear the sobs agonized joyous of that Evil One who wriggles through your thoughts and not to strangle the intruder But if you attack him it will only be out of some futile selfindulgence He is already your pseudonym you cannot do him violence without impunity Why evade the approach of the last act Why not attack yourself in your own name It would be quite false to suppose that the demoniac revelation is a presence inseparable from our duration yet when we are gripped by it we cannot imagine the quantity of neutral moments we have lived through before To invoke the devil is to tinge with a vestige of theology an ambiguous excitation which our pride refuses to accept as such But who does not know these fears in which we find ourselves face to face with the Prince of Darkness Our pride needs a name a great name in order to baptize an anguish which would be pitiable if it emanated only from physiology The traditional explanation seems more flattering to us a residue of metaphysics suits the mind    It is in this way that in order to veil our too immediate ills we resort to elegant although obsolete entities How admit that our most mysterious deliriums proceed from no more than nervous diseases whereas it is enough for us to think of the Demon in us or outside us in order to stand up straight again at once We inherit from our ancestors that propensity to objectivize our inmost evils mythology has impregnated our blood and literature has sustained in us a relish for effects    The Mockery of a New Life Nailed to ourselves we lack the capacity of leaving the path inscribed in the innateness of our despair Exempt ourselves from life because it is not our element No one hands out diplomas of nonexistence We must persevere in breathing feel the air burn our lips accumulate regrets at the heart of a reality which we have not hoped for and renounce giving an explanation for the Disease which brings about our downfall When each moment of time rushes upon us like a dagger when our flesh instigated by our desires refuses to be petrified how confront a single moment added to our fate With the help of what artifices might we find the strength of illusion to go in search of another life a new life It is because all men who cast a glance over their past ruins imagine in order to avoid the ruins to come that it is in their power to recommence something radically new They make themselves a solemn promise waiting for a miracle which would extricate them from this average abyss into which fate has plunged them But nothing happens They all continue to be the same modified only by the accentuation of this tendency to decline which is their characteristic We see around us only dilapidated inspirations and ardors every man promises everything but every man lives to know the fragility of his spark and Life s lack of genius in his life The authenticity of an existence consists in its own rain The crown of our Becoming a path that looks glorious and which leads to a rout the garland of our gifts camouflage of our gangrene    Under the sun triumphs a carrion spring beauty itself is merely death preening among the buds    I have known no new life which was not illusory and compromised at its roots I have seen each man advance into time to be isolated in an anguished rumination and to fall back into himself with as the sign of renewal the unforeseen grimace of his own hopes Triple Impasse The mind discovers Identity the soul Ennui the body Sloth It is one and the same principle of invariability differently expressed under the three forms of the universal yawn The monotony of existence justifies the rationalists thesis it shows us a legal universe in which everything is anticipated and adjusted the barbarism of no surprise comes to trouble its harmony If the same mind discovers Contradiction the same soul Delirium the same body Frenzy it is in order to beget new unrealities to escape a universe too demonstrably the same and it is the antirationalists thesis which prevails The flowering of absurdities reveals an existence before which all clarity of vision seems mockingly poor This is the perpetual aggression of the Unforeseeable Between these two tendencies man wields his ambiguity finding his place in neither life nor Idea he supposes himself predestined to the Arbitrary yet his intoxication of freedom is only a shudder within a fatality the form of his fate being no less regulated than that of a sonnet or a star Cosmogony of Desire Having lived out having verified all the arguments against life I have stripped it of its savors and wallowing in its lees I have experienced its nakedness I have known postsexual metaphysics the void of the futilely procreated universe and that dissipation of sweat which plunges you into an ageold chill anterior to the rages of matter And I have tried to be faithful to my knowledge to force my instincts to yield and realized that it is no use wielding the weapons of nothingness if you cannot turn them against yourself For the outburst of desires amid our knowledge which contradicts them creates a dreadful conflict between our mind opposing the Creation and the irrational substratum which binds us to it still Each desire humiliates the sum of our truths and forces us to reconsider our negations We endure a practical defeat yet our principles remain unshakable    We hoped to be no longer children of this world and here we are subject to the appetites like equivocal ascetics masters of time and grafted to our glands But this interplay is limitless each of our desires recreates the world and each of our thoughts annihilates it    In everyday life cosmogony alternates with apocalypse quotidian creators and wreckers we enact on an infinitesimal scale the eternal myths and each of our moments reproduces and prefigures the fate of seed and cinder pertaining to Infinity Interpretation of Actions No one would perform the merest action without the feeling that this action is the one and only reality Such blindness is the absolute basis the indisputable principle of all that exists The man who argues merely proves that he is less that doubt has sapped his vitality    But amid his very doubts he must feel the importance of his progress toward negation To know that nothing is worth the trouble becomes implicitly a belief hence a possibility of action this is because even a trifle of existence presupposes an unavowed faith a simple step even toward a mockup of reality is an apostasy with regard to nothingness breathing itself proceeds from an implicit fanaticism like any participation in movement    Life without Objective Neutral ideas like dry eyes dull looks which strip things of all dimension selfauscultations which reduce the feelings to phenomena of attention a vaporous life without tears and without laughter how to inculcate a sap a vernal vulgarity And how to endure this resigning heart this time too blunted to transmit even to its own seasons the ferment of growth and dissolution When you have seen a corruption in every conviction and in every attachment a profanation you no longer have the right to expect on earth or elsewhere a fate modified by hope You must choose some ideal absurdly solitary promontory or a farcical star refractory to all constellations Irresponsible out of melancholy your life has flouted its moments now life is the piety of duration the feeling of a dancing eternity time transcending itself and vies with the sun    Acedia This stagnation of the organs this stupor of the faculties this petrified smile do they not often remind you of the ennui of the cloisters hearts abandoned by God the dryness and idiocy of the monks loathing themselves in the ecstatic transports of masturbation You are merely a monk without divine hypotheses and without the pride of solitary vice Earth heaven are the walls of your cell and in the air no breath disturbs only the absence of orisons prevails Doomed to the empty hours of eternity to the periphery of shudders and the mildewed desires that rot at the approach of salvation you bestir yourself toward a Last Judgment without splendor and trumpets while your thoughts for solemnity have imagined no more than the unreal procession of hopes By grace of suffering souls once flung themselves toward the vaulting arches you stumble against them now and you fall back into the world as into a faithless convent lagging on the boulevard Order of Lost Creatures and of your perdition Crimes of Courage and Fear To be afraid is to think of yourself continually to be unable to imagine an objective course of events The sensation of the terrible the sensation that it is all happening against you supposes a world conceived without indifferent dangers The frightened man victim of an exaggerated subjectivity believes himself to be much more than the rest of his kind the target of hostile events He encounters the brave man in this error for the brave man at the antipodes sees only invulnerability everywhere Both have attained the extremity of a selfinfatuated consciousness everything conspires against the one to the other everything is favorable The brave man is only a braggart who embraces the danger who flees toward the danger One establishes himself negatively at the center of the world the other positively but their illusion is the same their knowledge having an identical point of departure danger as the only reality One fears it the other seeks it out they cannot conceive a lucid scorn of things they both relate everything to themselves they are overagitated and all the evil in the world comes from the excess of agitation from the dynamic fictions of bravery and cowardice  Thus these antinomic and equal examples are the agents of all our troubles the disturbers of the march of time they give an affective tinge to the least event and project their fevered intentions upon a universe which without an abandonment to calm disgusts is degrading and intolerable Courage and fear two poles of the same disease which consists in granting an abusive sense and seriousness to life    It is the lack of nonchalant bitterness which makes men into sectarian beasts the subtlest and the crudest crimes are perpetrated by those who take things seriously Only the dilettante has no taste for blood he alone is no scoundrel     Disintoxication The nonmysterious concerns of human beings may be drawn as clearly as the outlines of this page    What is to be inscribed here but the disgust of generations linked like propositions in the sterile fatality of a syllogism The human adventure will certainly come to an end which we may conceive without being its contemporary When we have consummated in ourselves the divorce with history it is quite superfluous to attend the formalities We need only look at man in the face to detach ourselves from him and to no longer regret his hoaxes Thousands of years of sufferings which would have softened the hearts of stones merely petrified this steely mayfly monstrous example of evanescence and hardening driven by one insipid madness a will to exist at once imperceptible and shameless When we realize that no human motive is compatible with infinity and that no gesture is worth the trouble of making it our heart by its very beating can no longer conceal its vacuity Men mingle in a uniform fate as futile for the indifferent eye as the stars or the crosses of a military cemetery Of all the goals proposed for existence which one subjected to analysis escapes the musichall or the morgue Which fails to reveal us as futile or sinister And is there a single stroke of magic is there one charm which can still deceive us When we are forbidden visible prescriptions we become like the devil metaphysically illegal we have left the order of the world no longer finding a place there we look at it without recognition stupefaction turns into a reflex while our plaintive astonishment lacking an object is forever fastened to the Void We undergo sensations which no longer correspond to things because nothing irritates them any longer thus we transcend even the dream of the angel of Melancholia and we regret that Durer did not languish for eyes even more remote    When everything seems too concrete tooexistent including our noblest vision and we sigh for an indefinite which would proceed from neither life nor death when every contact with Being is a violation of the soul the soul has been excluded from the universal jurisdiction and no longer having any accounting to make or laws to infringe vies by melancholy with the divine omnipotence Itinerary of Hate I hate no one but hatred blackens my blood and scorches this skin which the years were powerless to tan How prevail under tender or rigorous judgments over a hideous gloom and the scream of a man flayed alive I wanted to love heaven and earth their exploits and their fevers and I have found nothing which failed to remind me of death flowers stars faces symbols of withering potential slabs of all possible tombs What is created in life and ennobles it tends toward a macabre or mediocre end The effervescence of hearts has provoked disasters which no demon would have dared conceive Look upon a mind enflamed and be sure that you will end by being its victim Those who believe in their truth the only ones whose imprint is retained by the memory of men leave the earth behind them strewn with corpses Religions number in their ledgers more murders than the bloodiest tyrannies account for and those whom humanity has called divine far surpass the most conscientious murderers in their thirst for slaughter The man who proposes a new faith is persecuted until it is his turn to become a persecutor truths begin by a conflict with the police and end by calling them in for each absurdity we have suffered for degenerates into a legality as every martyrdom ends in the paragraphs of the Law in the insipidities of the calendar or the nomenclature of the streets In this world heaven itself becomes authority and we know ages which lived only by it Middle Ages more prodigal in wars than the most dissolute epochs bestial crusades tricked out as sublimities before which the invasions of the Huns seem the refrains of decadent hordes Immaculate exploits decline into public enterprise consecration dims the most aerial halo An angel protected by a policeman that is how truths die that is how enthusiasms expire It is enough that a rebellion be right and create adherents a revelation be propagated and an institution confiscate it for the oncesolitary transports divided among a few neophyte dreamers to be corrupted in a prostituted existence Show me one thing here on earth which has begun well and which has not ended badly The proudest palpitations are engulfed in a sewer where they cease throbbing as though having reached their natural term this downfall constitutes the heart s drama and the negative meaning of history Each ideal fed at its beginning on the blood of its votaries erodes and collapses when it is adopted by the mob The font transformed into a spittoon that is the ineluctable rhythm of progress    Under these conditions upon whom are we to pour out our hatred No one is responsible for being and still less for being what he is Afflicted with existence each man endures like an animal the consequences which proceed from it Thus in a world where everything is detestable hatred becomes huger than the world and having transcended its object cancels itself out It is not our suspect exhaustions or the specific disturbances of our organs which reveal the low point of our vitality nor is it our perplexities or the variations of the thermometer but we need merely endure those fits of hatred and pity without motive those nonmeasurable fevers to understand that our equilibrium is threatened To hate everything and to hate yourself in a frenzy of cannibal rage to pity everyone and to pity yourself apparently contradictory impulses but at their source identical for we can pity only what we want to do away with what does not deserve to exist And in these convulsions the man who endures them and the universe to which they are addressed are doomed to the same destructive and pitying fury When all of a sudden you are overcome with compassion without knowing for whom it is because a lassitude of the organs presages a dangerous decline and when this vague and universal compassion turns toward yourself you are in the condition of the last and least of men It is from an enormous physical weakness that this negative solidarity emanates a solidarity which in hate or pity binds us to things These two frenzies simultaneous or consecutive are not so much uncertain symptoms as clear signs of a falling vitality irritated by anything and everything from undelineated existence to the precision of our own person Yet we must not deceive ourselves these outbreaks are the clearest and the most immoderate but scarcely the only ones at different degrees everything is pathology except for Indifference La Perduta Gente What a preposterous notion to draw circles in hell to make the intensity of the flames vary in its compartments to hierarchize its torments The important thing is to be there the rest mere fiorituras or    burns In the heavenly city gentler prefiguration of the one below both being under the same management the essential thing too is not to be something king bourgeois daylaborer but to adhere to it or to escape it You can champion some idea or other have a place or crawl from the moment your actions and your thoughts serve a form of real or imagined city you are its idolators and its captives The timidest employee and the wildest anarchist if they take a different interest here live as its function they are both citizens internally though the one prefers his slippers and the other his bomb The circles of the earthly city like those of the one underground imprison beings in a damned community and drag them in the same procession of sufferings in which to look for nuances would be a waste of time The man who acquiesces in human affairs in any form revolutionary or conservative consumes himself in a pitiable delectation he commingles his nobilities and his vulgarities in the confusion of Becoming    To the dissenter within or outside the city reluctant to intervene in the course of great events or small all modalities of life in common seem equally contemptible History can offer him only the pale interest of renewed disappointments and anticipated artifices The man who has lived among men and still lies in wait for a single unexpected event such a man has understood nothing and never will He is ripe for the City everything must be given him every office and every honor So it is with all men which explains the longevity of this sublunary hell History and Language Who can resist the autumnal wisdom of the flaccid and faisande civilizations The Greek s horror like the belated Roman s of freshness and the hyperborean reflexes emanated from a repulsion for dawns for barbarism overflowing with futures and for the stupidities of health The resplendent corruption of every historic lateseason is darkened by the proximity of the Scythian No civilization can draw out an indefinite agony tribes prowl about scenting the aromas of perfumed corpses    Thus the enthusiast of sunsets contemplates the failure of all refinement and the insolent advance of vitality Nothing left for him to do but collect from the sum of the future a few anecdotes   A system of events no longer proves anything the great deeds have joined the fairy tales and the handbooks The glorious exploits of the past like the men who performed them are still of interest only for the fine words which have consecrated them Woe to the conqueror without a word to say Jesus himself though an indirect dictator for two thousand years marked the memory of his faithful and of his detractors only by the tatters of paradoxes which strew a biography so adroitly scenic How inquire about a martyr today if he has not uttered remarks adequate to his sufferings We keep the memory of past or recent victims only if their language has immortalized the blood which has spattered them The executioners themselves survive only insofar as they were performers Nero would be long since forgotten without his outbursts of bloody clowning When at the dying man s bedside his nearest and dearest bend over his stammerings it is not so much to decipher in them some last wish but rather to gather up a good phrase which they can quote later on in order to honor his memory If the Roman historians never fail to describe the agony of their emperors it is in order to place within them a sentence or an exclamation which the latter uttered or were supposed to have uttered This is true for all deathbeds even the most ordinary That life signifies nothing everyone knows or suspects let it at least be saved by a turn of phrase A sentence at the corners of their life that is about all we ask of the great and of the small If they fail this requirement this obligation they are lost forever for we forgive everything down to crimes on condition they are exquisitely glossed and glossed over This is the absolution man grants history as a whole when no other criterion is seen to be operative and valid and when he himself recapitulating the general inanity finds no other dignity than that of a litterateur of failure and an aesthete of bloodshed In this world where sufferings are merged and blurred only the Formula prevails Philosophy and Prostitution The philosopher disappointed with systems and superstitions but still persevering in the ways of the world should imitate the sidewalk Pyrrhonism exhibited by the least dogmatic of creatures the prostitute Detached from everything and open to everything espousing her client s mood and ideas changing tone and face on each occasion ready to be sad or gay being indifferent lavishing sighs out of commercial concern casting upon the frolic of her superimposed and sincere neighbor an enlightened and artificial gaze she proposes to the mind a model of behavior which vies with that of the sages To be without convictions in regard to men and oneself such is the high lesson of prostitution peripatetic academy of lucidity marginal to society as is philosophy Everything I know I learned in the School of Whores should be die exclamation of the thinker who accepts everything and rejects everything when following their example he has specialized in the weary smile when men are to him merely clients and die world s sidewalks the marketplace where he sells his bitterness as his companions sell their bodies Obsession of the Essential When every question seems accidental and peripheral when the mind seeks ever greater problems it turns out that in its procedure it no longer comes up against any object but the diffuse obstacle of the Void Thereupon the philosophic energy exclusively oriented toward the inaccessible is exposed to ruin Scrutinizing things and their temporal pretexts it imposes salutary embarrassments upon itself but if it seeks an increasingly general principle it is lost and annihilated in the vagueness of the Essential Only those who stop apropos in philosophy flourish those who accept the limitation and the comfort of a reasonable stage of anxiety Every problem if we get to the bottom of it leads to bankruptcy and leaves the intellect exposed no more questions and no more answers in a space without horizon The interrogations turn against the mind which has conceived them it becomes their victim Everything is hostile to it its own solitude its own audacity the opaque absolute the unverifiable gods and the manifest nothingness Woe to the man who having arrived at a certain moment of the essential has not drawn up short History shows that the thinkers who mounted to the top of the ladder of questions who set their foot on the last rung that of the absurd have bequeathed to posterity only an example of sterility whereas their confreres stopping halfway up have fertilized the mind s growth they have served their kind they have transmitted some wellturned idol some polished superstitions some errors disguised as principles and a system of hopes Had they embraced the dangers of an excessive progression this scorn of charitable mistakes would have rendered them disastrous to others and to themselves they would have inscribed their names on the confines of the universe and of thought unhealthy seekers and arid reprobates amateurs of fruitless dizziness hunters of dreams it is not permitted to dream    Ideas refractory to the Essential are the only ones to have a purchase on men What would they do with a region of thought where even the man who aspires to settle by natural inclination or morbid thirst is jeopardized No breathing in a realm alien to the usual doubts And if certain minds locate themselves outside the agreed upon inquiries it is because an instinct rooted in the depths of matter or a vice rising out of a cosmic disease has taken possession of them and has led them to an order of reflections so exigent and so enormous that death itself seems of no importance the elements of destiny mere nonsense and the apparatus of metaphysics no more than utilitarian and suspect This obsession with a last frontier this progress in the void involve the most dangerous form of sterility beside which nothingness itself seems a promise of fecundity The man who is difficult in what he does in his task or his adventure has merely to transplant his demand for finish to the universal level in order to be no longer able to complete either his work or his life Metaphysical anguish derives from the condition of a supremely scrupulous artisan whose object would be nothing less than being By dint of analysis he achieves the impossibility of composing of perfecting a miniature of the universe The artist abandoning his poem exasperated by the indigence of words prefigures the confusion of the mind discontented within the context of the existent Incapacity to organize the elements as stripped of meaning and savor as the words which express them leads to the revelation of the void Thus the rhymer withdraws into silence or into impenetrable artifices In the face of the universe the overexigent mind suffers a defeat like Mallarme s in the face of art It is panic before an object which is no longer an object which can no longer be manipulated for ideally its limits have been transcended Those who do not remain inside the realty they cultivate those who transcend the task of existing must either compromise with the inessential reverse gears and take their places in the eternal farce or accept all the consequences of a severed condition which is either superfetation or tragedy depending on whether it is contemplated or endured Felicity of Epigones Is there a pleasure more subtly ambiguous than to watch the ruin of a myth What dilapidation of hearts in order to beget it what excesses of intolerance in order to make it respected what terror for those who do not assent to it and what expense of hopes for those who watch it    expire Intelligence flourishes only in the ages when beliefs wither when their articles and their precepts slacken when their rules collapse Every period s ending is the mind s paradise for the mind regains its play and its whims only within an organism in utter dissolution The man who has the misfortune to belong to a period of creation and fecundity suffers its limitations and its ruts slave of a unilateral vision he is enclosed within a limited horizon The most fertile moments in history were at the same time the most airless they prevailed Eke a fatality a blessing for the naive mind mortal to an amateur of intellectual space Freedom has scope only among the disabused and sterile epigones among the intellects of belated epochs epochs whose style is coming apart and is no longer inspired except by a certain ironic indulgence To belong to a church uncertain of its god after once imposing that god by fire and sword should be the ideal of every detached mind When a myth languishes and turns diaphanous and the institution which sustains it turns clement and tolerant problems acquire a pleasant elasticity The weak point of a faith the diminished degree of its vigor set up a tender void in men s souls and render them receptive though without permitting them to be blind yet to the superstitions which lie in wait for the future they darken already The mind is soothed only by those agonies of history which precede the insanity of every dawn    Ultimate Audacity If it is true that Nero exclaimed Lucky Priam who saw the ruin of your country let us grant him the merit of having acceded to a sublime defiance to the last hypostasis of the beau geste and lugubrious grandiloquence After such a phrase so marvelously appropriate in an emperor s mouth one is entitled to banality one is even compelled to it Who could pretend to further extravagance The petty accidents of our triviality force us to admire this cruel and histrionic Caesar all the more in that his madness has known a glory greater than the sighs of his victims written history being at least as inhuman as the events which provoke it  Beside his all attitudes seem antics And if it is true that he set Rome on fire in imitation of the Iliad was there ever a more tangible homage to a work of art In any case it is the one example of literary criticism at work of an active aesthetic judgment The effect a book has upon us is real only if we crave to imitate its plot to kill if its hero kills to be jealous if he is jealous to take sick and die if he suffers and expires But all this for us remains in the potential state or declines to dead letters only Nero grants himself literature as a spectacle his accounting is made with the ashes of his contemporaries and of his capital    Such words and such actions had to be uttered and performed at least once A criminal took them upon himself This can console us indeed it must or else how should we resume our customary behavior and our convenient and prudent truths Effigy of the Failure Having a horror of any action he keeps telling himself Movement what folly It is not so much events which vex him as the notion of participating in them and he bestirs himself only in order to turn away from them His sneers have devastated life before he has exhausted its juice He is a crossroads Ecclesiast who finds in the universal meaninglessness an excuse for his defeats Eager to find everything unimportant he succeeds easily the evidence preponderant on his side In the battle of arguments he is always the wiener as he is always the loser in action he is right he rejects everything and everything rejects him He has prematurely compromised what must not be compromised in order to live and since his talent was overenlightened as to his own functions he has squandered it lest it dribble away into the inanity of a work Bearing the image of what he might have been as a stigma and a halo he blushes and flatters himself on the excellence of his sterility forever alien to naive seductions the one free man among the helots of Time He extracts his liberty from the enormity of his lack of accomplishments he is an infinite and pitiable god whom no creation limits no creature worships and whom no one spares The scorn he has poured out on others is returned by them He expiates only the actions he has not performed though their number exceeds the calculations of his wounded pride But at the end as a kind of consolation and at the close of a life without honors he wears his uselessness like a crown What s the use the Failure s adage the maxim of death s timeserver    What a stimulant when you begin to suffer its obsession For death before weighing too heavily upon us enriches us our powers grow at its contact then it performs its work of destruction upon us The evidence of the uselessness of all effort and that sensation of a future corpse already rising into the present and filling time s horizon end by benumbing our ideas our hopes and our muscles so that the excess of energy provoked by the quite recent obsession is converted when that obsession is irrevocably implanted in the mind into a stagnation of our vitality Thus this obsession incites us to become everything and nothing Normally it should confront us with the one choice possible the convent or the cabaret But when we can evade it by neither eternity nor pleasures when attacked in the midst of life we are as far from heaven as from vulgarity it transforms us into that kind of decomposed hero who promises everything and accomplishes nothing idle men wasting their breath in the Void vertical carrion whose sole activity is reduced to thinking that they will cease to be    Conditions of Tragedy If Jesus had ended his career upon the Cross if he had not been committed to resuscitation what a splendid tragic hero His divine aspect has cost literature an admirable subject Thereby he shares the fate aesthetically mediocre of all just men Like everything which perpetuates itself in men s hearts like everything which is exposed to worship and does not irremediably die he does not lend himself to that vision of a total end which marks out a tragic destiny For that it would have been necessary that Jesus have no followers and that the transfiguration did not come to raise him to an illicit halo Nothing more alien to tragedy than the notion of redemption of salvation and immortality The hero succumbs under the weight of his own actions without its being granted him to evade his death by some supernatural grace he continues as an existence in no way whatever he remains distinct in men s memory as a spectacle of suffering having no disciples his sterile destiny proves fruitful to nothing but other people s imagination Macbeth collapses without the hope of a redemption there is no extreme unction in tragedy    The nature of a faith even if it must fail is to elude the Irreparable What could Shakespeare have done with a martyr The true hero fights and dies in the name of his destiny and not in the name of a belief His existence eliminates any notion of an escape the paths which do not lead him to death are dead ends to him he works at his biography he tends to his denouement and instinctively manages everything to bring about events fatal to himself Fatality being his vital juice every way out can be no more than a disloyalty to his destruction Thus the man of destiny is never converted to any belief whatever he would thereby spoil his end And if he were immobilized on the cross it is not he who would raise his eyes to heaven his own history is his sole absolute as his will to tragedy is his sole desire    The Immanent Lie To live signifies to believe and to hope to lie and to lie to oneself This is why the most truthful image ever created of man remains that of the Knight of the Doleful Countenance that Don whom we find in even the most fulfilled of the sages The painful episode around the Cross and the other more majestic one crowned by Nirvana participate in the same unreality though they have been granted a symbolic quality denied by the sequel of the poor hidalgo s adventures Not all men can succeed the fecundity of their lies varies    One deception triumphs there results a religion a doctrine or a myth and a host of adepts another fails then it is only a divagation a theory or a fiction Only inert things add nothing to what they are a stone does not lie it interests no one whereas life indefatigably invents life is the novel of matter A dust infatuated with ghosts such is man his absolute image ideally lifelike would be incarnated in a Don Quixote seen by Aeschylus   If life occupies the first place in the hierarchy of lies love comes immediately afterward lie within the lie Expression of our hybrid position love is surrounded by an apparatus of beatitudes and torments thanks to which we find in someone a substitute for ourselves By what hoax do two eyes turn us away from our solitude Is there any failure more humiliating for the mind Love lulls knowledge wakened knowledge kills love Unreality cannot triumph indefinitely even disguised in the appearances of the most exalting lie And moreover who would have an illusion solid enough to find in the other what he has vainly sought in himself Would a furnace of guts afford what the whole universe could not give us And yet this is the actual basis of this common and supernatural anomaly to solve a deux rather to suspend all enigmas by means of an imposture to forget that fiction in which life is steeped by a double murmur to fill the general vacuity and parody of ecstasy to drown oneself at last in the sweat of some accomplice or other    The Coming of Consciousness How much our instincts must have had to be blunted and their functioning slackened before consciousness extended its control over the sum of our actions and our thoughts The first natural reaction suppressed involved all the postponements of vital activity all our failures in the immediate Man an animal with retarded desires is a lucid nothingness encircling everything and encircled by nothing who surveys all objects and possesses none Compared to the coming of consciousness other events are of a minor importance or none at all But this advent in contradiction with the data of life constitutes a dangerous explosion at the heart of the animate world a scandal in biology Nothing suggested its imminence natural automatism suggested no likelihood of an animal flinging itself beyond matter The gorilla losing its for and replacing it by ideals the gorilla in gloves forging gods aggravating his grimaces and adoring the heavens how much nature was to suffer and will suffer still before such a fall This is because consciousness leads far and permits everything For the animal life is an absolute for man it is an absolute and a pretext In the evolution of the universe there is no phenomenon more important than this possibility reserved for us of converting every object into a pretext to play with our everyday undertakings and our last ends to put on the same level by the divinity of whim a god and a broomstick And man will be rid of his ancestors and of nature only when he has liquidated in himself every vestige of the Unconditioned when his life and that of others will seem no more to him than a set of strings he will pull for laughs in an amusement for the end of time Then he will be the pure being Consciousness will have played its role    The Arrogance of Prayer When we reach the limits of monologue the confines of solitude we invent for lack of another interlocutor God supreme pretext of dialogue So long as you name Him your madness is well disguised and   all is permitted The true believer is scarcely to be distinguished from the madman but his madness is legal acknowledged he would end up in an asylum if his aberrations were pure of all faith But God covers them legitimizes them The pride of a conqueror pales beside the ostentation of a believer who addresses himself to the Creator How can one dare so much And how could modesty be a virtue of temples when a decrepit old woman who imagines Infinity within reach raises herself by prayer to a level of audacity to which no tyrant has ever laid claim I should sacrifice the world s empire for one single moment when my clasped hands would implore the great Responsible for our riddles and our banalities Yet this moment constitutes the common quality and in a sense the official time of any believer But the man who is truly modest keeps repeating to himself Too humble to pray too inert to step across the church threshold I resign myself to my shadow and seek no capitulation from God before my prayers And to those who offer him immortality he replies My pride is not inexhaustible its resources are limited You imagine in the name of faith that you are conquering your self in fact you seek to perpetuate it in eternity this earthly duration being insufficient for you Your vainglory exceeds in refinement all the ambitions of the age What dream of fame compared to yours fails to turn out deception and smoke Your faith is merely a folie de grandeurs tolerated by the community because it has taken disguised paths but your dust is your one obsession greedy for the timeless you persecute the time which disperses it The Beyond alone is spacious enough for your cravings the earth and its moments seem too fragile for you The megalomania of monasteries exceeds all that the sumptuous fevers of palaces ever imagined The man who does not assent to his nothingness is mentally diseased And the believer of all men is the least disposed to assent to it The will to endure pushed to such lengths terrifies me I reject the morbid seduction of an indefinite Me   I want to wallow in my mortality I want to remain normal Lord give me the capacity of never praying spare me the insanity of all worship let this temptation of love pass from me which would deliver me forever unto You Let the void spread between my heart and heaven I have no desire to people my deserts by Your presence to tyrannize my nights by Your light to dissolve my Siberias beneath Your sun Lonelier than You I want my hands pure the contrary of Yours which were forever corrupted by kneading the earth and busying themselves with the world s affairs I ask Your stupid omnipotence for nothing but the respect of my solitude and my torments What have I to do with Your words And I fear the madness which would make me hear them Grant me the miracle gathered before the first moment the peace which You could not tolerate and which incited You to breach the nothingness in order to make way for this carnival of time and thereby to condemn me to the universe to humiliation and the shame of Being Lypemania Why do you lack the strength to escape the obligation to breathe Why still endure that solidified air which clogs your lungs and crushes your flesh How vanquish these opaque hopes and these petrified ideas when turn and turn about you imitate the solidified of a crag or the isolation of a wad of spittle frozen on the edge of the world You are farther from yourself than an undiscovered planet and your organs turned toward the graveyards envy their dynamism    Open your veins in order to flood this page which infuriates you the way the seasons do Absurd effort Your blood faded by white nights has suspended its flow    Nothing will waken in you the need for living and dying extinguished by the years forever slaked by those springs without murmur or prestige at which men quench their thirst Monster with mute dry lips you will remain beyond the sounds of life and death beyond even the sound of tears    The true greatness of the saints consists in that incomparable power of defeating the Fear of Ridicule We cannot weep without shame they invoked the gift of tears A preoccupation with honor in our dryness immobilizes us into the spectators of our bitter and repressed infinity our streams that do not flow Yet the eyes function is not to see but to weep and really to see we must close them that is the condition of ecstasy of the one revealing vision whereas perception is exhausted in the horror of the deja vu of an irreparable recognition scene which occurred at the beginning    For the man who has foreseen the world s futile disasters and to whom knowledge has afforded only the confirmation of an innate disenchantment the scruples which keep him from weeping accentuate his predestination to melancholy And if he actually envies the saints exploits it is not so much for their disgust with appearances or their transcendent appetite but rather for their victory over that fear of ridicule which he cannot avoid and which keeps him on this side of the supernatural indecorum of tears Everyday Curse To repeat to yourself a thousand times a day Nothing on earth has any worth to keep finding yourself at the same point to circle stupidly as a top eternally    For there is no progression in the notion of universal vanity nor conclusion and as far as we venture in such ruminations our knowledge makes no gain it is in its present state as rich and as void as at its point of departure It is a surcease within the incurable a leprosy of the mind a revelation by stupor A simpleminded person an idiot who has experienced an illumination and grown used to it with no means of leaving it behind of recovering his vague and comfortable condition such is the state of the man who finds himself committed in spite of himself to the perception of universal futility Abandoned by his nights virtually a victim of a lucidity which smothers him what is he to do with this day which never manages to end When will the light stop shedding its beams deadly to the memory of a night world anterior to all that was How far away chaos is restful and calm the chaos dating from before the terrible Creation or sweeter still the chaos of mental nothingness Defense of Corruption If we put in one pan the evil the pure have poured out upon the world and in the other the evil that has come from men without principles and without scruples the scale would tip toward the first In the mind that proposes it every recipe for salvation erects a guillotine    The disasters of corrupt periods have less gravity than the scourges caused by the ardent ones mud is more agreeable than blood and there is more mildness in vice than in virtue more humanity in depravity than in austerity The man who rules and believes in nothing behold the model of a paradise of forfeiture a sovereign solution to history Opportunists have saved nations heroes have ruined them To feel that one is a contemporary not of the Revolution and of Bonaparte but of Fouche and of Talleyrand the only thing lacking in the latters versatility was a drop of melancholy for them to suggest by their actions a whole Art of Living It is the dissolute ages which can claim the merit of laying bare the essence of life of showing us that everything is onlyfarce or gall and that no event is worth being touched up it is necessarily execrable The embellished lie of the great periods of this century that king that pope    The truth appears only at those moments when men s minds forgetting the constructive delirium let themselves slip back into the dissolution of morals of ideals and of beliefs To know is to see it is neither to hope nor to try The stupidity which characterizes history s peaks has no equivalent but the ineptitude of those who are its agents It is out of a lack of finesse that we carry our actions and our thoughts to their conclusions A detached mind shrinks from tragedy and apotheosis disgraces and palms exasperate such a spirit as much as banality To go too far is to give an infallible proof of bad taste The aesthete has a horror of blood sublimity and heroes    He still values only the dissipated    The Obsolete Universe The aging process in the verbal universe follows a much more accelerated rhythm than in the material one Words too often repeated weaken and die whereas monotony constitutes the very law of matter The mind should have an infinite dictionary but its means are limited to a few expressions trivialized by usage Hence the new requiring strange combinations forces words into unexpected functions originality is reduced to the torment of the adjective and to the suggestive impropriety of metaphor Put words in their place that is the everyday graveyard of Speech What is consecrated in a language constitutes its death an anticipated word is a defunct one only its artificial use imbues it with a new vigor until it is commonly adopted worn corrupted    The mind is precious or it is not the mind whereas nature lolls in the simplicity of its always identical means What we call our life in relation to life is an incessant creation of vogues with the help of an artificially manipulated speech it is a proliferation of futilities without which we should have to expire in a yawn that would engulf history and matter alike If man invents a new physics it is not so much to arrive at a valid explanation of nature as to escape the boredom of the understood habitual vulgarly irreducible universe to which he arbitrarily attributes as many dimensions as we project adjectives upon an inert thing we are tired of seeing and suffering as it was seen and suffered by die stupidity of our ancestors or of our immediate predecessors Woe to the man who having understood this masquerade withdraws from it He will have encroached upon the secret of his vitality and he will join the motionless unaffected truth of those in whom the wellsprings of the Precious have dried up and whose mind is etiolated for want of the artificial It is only too legitimate to imagine the moment when life will no longer be the fashion when it will fall into desuetude like the moon or tuberculosis after the abuses of romanticism life will then crown the anachronism of the denuded symbols and the unmasked diseases it will once again become itself an ill without prestige a fatality without luster And that moment is only too foreseeable when no hope will reappear in men s hearts when the earth will be as glacial as its creatures when no dream will come back to embellish the sterile immensity of it all Humanity will blush to beget when it sees things as they are Life without the sap of mistakes and deceptions life ceasing to be a vogue will find no clemency at the mind s tribunal But finally that mind itself will give way it is only an excuse in the void as life is only a prejudice History sustains itself as long as above our transitory fashions of which events are the shadow a more general fashion floats like a constant but when this constant is generally exposed as a simple whim when the knowledge of the mistake of living becomes common property and unanimous truth where shall we seek resources in order to engender or even to sketch out an action the simulacrum of a gesture By what art survive our lucid instincts and our perspicacious hearts By what miracle reanimate a future temptation in an obsolete universe Decrepit Man I no longer want to collaborate with the light or use the jargon of life And I shall no longer say I am without blushing The immodesty of the breath the scandal of the lungs are linked to the abuse of an auxiliary verb    The time is past when man thought of himself in terms of a dawn behold him resting on an anemic matter open to his true duty the duty of studying his loss and of rushing into it    behold him on the threshold of a new epoch the epoch of SelfPity And this Pity is his second fall more distinct and more humiliating than the first it is a fall without redemption Vainly he inspects the horizons a thousand saviors are silhouetted there humbug saviors themselves unconsoled He turns away in order to prepare himself in his overripe soul for the sweetness of corruption    Having reached the intimacy of his autumn he wavers between Appearance and Nothingness between the deceptive form of Being and its absence vibration between two unrealities    Consciousness occupies the void which follows the mind s erosion of existence It takes the obnubilation of an idiot or a believer to participate in reality which collapses at the approach of the slightest doubt a suspicion of improbability or a shudder of anguish so many rudiments which prefigure consciousness and which once developed beget it define and exasperate it Under the effect of this consciousness of this incurable presence man gains access to his highest privilege that of destroying himself Nature s privileged patient man corrupts her sap abstract vice of the instincts he destroys their vigor The universe withers at his touch and time decamps    He could fulfill himself and descend the further slope only on the wreck of the elements His work completed he is ripe for disappearance through how many centuries more will his death rattle sound  THE SECONDHAND THINKER The SecondHand Thinker Advantages of Debility The Parasite of Poets Tribulations of an Alien Ennui of Conquerors Music and Skepticism The Automaton On Melancholy The Thirst for Power Position of the Poor Ideas are substitutes for griefs Marcel Proust The SecondHand Thinker I live in expectation of the Idea I foresee it close in upon it get a grip and cannot formulate it it escapes me does not yet belong to me might I have conceived it in my absence And how once imminent and vague to make it present and luminous in the intelligible agony of expression What conditions should I hope for if it is to bloom and decay Antiphilosopher I abhor every indifferent idea I am not always despondent hence I do not always think When I consider ideas they seem even more useless than things hence I have loved only the elucubrations of the great invalids the ruminations of insomnia the flashes of an incurable fear and the doubts intersected by sighs The amount of chiaroscuro an idea harbors is the only index of its profundity as the despairing accent of its playfulness is the index of its fascination How many white nights does your nocturnal past conceal That is how we ought to confront every thinker The man who thinks when he wants to has nothing to tell us above or rather alongside his thoughts he is not responsible for them not committed to them neither wins nor loses by risking himself in a struggle in which he himself is not his own enemy It costs him nothing to believe in Truth Which is not the case for a mind where true and false have ceased to be superstitions destroyer of all criteria such a mind verifies itself like invalids and poets it thinks by accident the glory of a discomfort or of a delirium suffices Is not an indigestion richer in ideas than a parade of concepts Malfunctions of our organs determine the fruitfulness of our minds the man who does not feel his body will never be in a position to conceive a living thought he will wait to no purpose for the advantageous surprise of some disadvantage    In affective indifference ideas assume a profile yet none can take shape it is up to melancholy to afford a climate to their blossoming They require a certain tonality a certain color in order to vibrate to shine To be sterile a long time is to lie in wait for them to yearn for them without being able to compromise them in a formula The mind s seasons are conditioned by an organic rhythm it is not up to me to be naive or cynical my truths are the sophisms of my enthusiasm or of my dejection I exist I feel and I think according to the moment and in spite of myself Time constitutes me in vain I oppose myself and am My undesired present unfolds unfolds me unable to command it I comment upon it slave of my thoughts I play with them fatality s buffoon    Advantages of Debility The individual who fails to transcend his quality as a splendid example a finished model and whose existence is identified with his vital destiny locates himself outside the mind Ideal masculinity obstacle to the perception of nuance involves an insensitivity to the aspect of the everyday supernatural from which art draws its substance The more one is a nature the less one is an artist Homogeneous undifferentiated opaque vigor was idolized by the world of legends by the fantasies of mythology When the Greeks turned to speculation the cult of the anemic ephebe replaced that of the giants and the heroes themselves sublime dolts in Homer s time became thanks to tragedy bearers of torments and doubts incompatible with their rough nature Internal wealth results from conflicts sustained within oneself now the vitality which is entirely selfpossessed knows only external struggle the attack upon the object In the male weakened by a dose of femininity two tendencies are at grips by what is passive in himself he apprehends a whole world of relinquishment by what is imperious he converts his will into law As long as his instincts remain unslaked he concerns only the species once a secret dissatisfaction creeps in he becomes a conqueror The mind justifies explains and excuses him and classifying him among the superior simpletons abandons him to History s curiosity the investigation of stupidity in action    The man whose existence does not constitute a disease both vigorous and vague can never establish himself among problems nor know their dangers The condition favorable to the search for truth or for expression is to be found halfway between man and woman the gaps in virility are the seat of the mind    If the pure female whom we can accuse of no sexual or psychic anomaly is internally emptier than an animal the intact male fits the definition of cretin Consider any human being who has caught your attention or roused your fervor something in his mechanism has been unhinged to his advantage We rightly scorn those who have not made use of their defects who have not exploited their deficiencies and have not been enriched by their losses as we despise any man who does not suffer at being a man or simply at being Hence no graver insult can be inflicted than to call someone happy no greater flattery than to grant him a vein of melancholy     This is because gaiety is linked to no important action and because except for the mad no one laughs when he is alone Inner life is the prerogative of the delicate those tremulous wretches subject to an epilepsy with neither froth nor falling the biologically sound being scorns depth is incapable of it sees in it a suspect dimension which jeopardizes the spontaneity of his actions Nor is he mistaken with the retreat into the self begins the individual s drama his glory and his decline isolated from the anonymous flux from the utilitarian trickle of life he frees himself from objective goals A civilization is affected when its delicate members set the tone for it but thanks to them it has definitively triumphed over nature and collapses An extreme example of refinement unites in himself the exalte and the sophist he no longer adheres to his impulses cultivates without crediting them this is the omniscient debility of twilight ages prefiguration of man s eclipse The delicate allow us to glimpse the moment when janitors will be tormented by aesthetes scruples when farmers bent double by doubts will no longer have the vigor to guide the plow when every human being gnawed by lucidity and drained of instincts will be wiped out without the strength to regret the flourishing darkness of their illusions    The Parasite of Poets I There can be no issue in a poet s life It is from everything he has not undertaken from all the moments fed on the inaccessible that his power comes to him If he finds existence a disadvantage his expressive faculties are thereby reinforced his inspiration dilated A biography is legitimate only if it focuses the elasticity of a fate the sum of variables it contains But the poet follows a line of fatality whose rigor nothing inflects Life belongs to dolts and it is in order to fill out the life they have not had that we have invented the lives of the poets    Poetry expresses the essence of what cannot be possessed its ultimate meaning the impossibility of all actuality Joy is not a poetic sentiment though it proceeds from a sector of the lyric universe in which chance unites in one and the same bundle flames and fatuities  Who has ever read a song of hope which failed to inspire a sensation of discomfort even of disgust And how sing a presence when the possible itself is shadowed with vulgarity Between poetry and hope complete incompatibility hence the poet is a prey to an ardent decomposition Who would dare to wonder how he has experienced life when it is by death that he has been alive at all When he succumbs to the temptation of happiness he belongs to comedy    But if on the other hand flames spring up from his wounds and he sings felicity that voluptuous incandescence of woe he rescues himself from the nuance of vulgarity inherent in any positive accent Thus a Holderlin withdrawing to a dream Greece and transfiguring love by purer intoxications by those of unreality    The poet would be an odious deserter of reality if in his flight he failed to take his suffering alone Unlike the mystic or the sage he cannot escape himself nor leave the stage of his own obsession even his ecstasies are incurable and harbingers of disasters Unable to run away for him everything is possible except life    II This is how I recognize an authentic poet by frequenting him living a long time in the intimacy of his work something changes in myself not so much my inclinations or my tastes as my very blood as if a subtle disease had been injected to alter its course its density and nature Valery and Stefan George leave us where we picked them up or else make us more demanding on the formal level of the mind they are geniuses we have no need of they are merely artists But a Shelley but a Baudelaire but a Rilke intervene in the deepest part of our organism which annexes them as it would a vice In their vicinity a body is fortified then weakens and disintegrates For the poet is an agent of destruction a virus a disguised disease and the gravest danger though a wonderfully vague one for our red corpuscles To live around him is to feel your blood run thin to dream a paradise of anemia and to hear in your veins the rustle of tears    III Whereas verse permits everything you can pour into it tears shames ecstasies complaints above all prose forbids you to give vent to lament its conventional abstraction is opposed to overflowing Prose requires other truths verifiable deduced measured But what if you were to steal those of poetry if you pillaged its substance and dared as much as the poets Why not insinuate into discourse their indecencies their humiliations their grimaces and their sighs Why not be decomposed rotten corpse angel or Satan in the language of the vulgar and pathetically betray so many aerial and sinister moods Much more than in the school of the philosophers it is in the academy of poets that we learn the courage of intelligence and the audacity to be ourselves Their affirmations outdo the most strangely impertinent sayings of the ancient sophists No one adopts them has there ever been a single thinker who went as far as Baudelaire or who steeled himself to systematize a Lear s howl Hamlet s soliloquy Nietzsche perhaps before his end but unfortunately he kept harping on his prophet s string    And if we looked among the saints Certain frenzies of Teresa of Avila or Angela of Foligno    But here we meet God too frequently God that consoling blank who reinforcing their courage diminishes its quality To advance without convictions and alone among the truths is not given to a man nor even to a saint sometimes though to a poet    I can imagine a thinker exclaiming in an impulse of pride I d like a poet to make his fate out of my thoughts But for such an aspiration to be legitimate he himself would have to have frequented the poets a long time he would have to have borrowed from them the joys of malediction and given back abstract and completed the image of their own defections or their own deliriums above all he would have to have succumbed on the threshold of song and a living anthem this side of inspiration to have known the regret of not being a poet of not being initiated into the science of tears the scourges of the heart the formal orgies the immortalities of the moment    Many times I have dreamed of a melancholy and erudite monster versed in all idioms familiar with numbers and souls alike who would wander the world feeding on poisons fervors ecstasies crossing Persias Chinas defunct Indies and dying Europes many times I have dreamed of a friend of the poets who would have known them all out of his despair at not being one of them Tribulations of an Alien Offspring of some wretched tribe he prowls the boulevards of the West Cherishing one country after the next he no longer hopes for any stuck in a timeless twilight citizen of the world and of no world he is ineffectual nameless powerless    Peoples without a destiny cannot give one to their sons who thirsting for other horizons attach themselves to a fate and ultimately exhaust it to finish their days as ghosts of their admirations and their exhaustions Having nothing to love at home they locate their love elsewhere in other lands where their fervor astonishes the natives Overworked the feelings erode and disintegrate admiration first of all    And the Alien who dispersed himself on so many highways of the world exclaims I have set up countless idols for myself have raised too many altars everywhere and I have knelt before a host of gods Now weary of worship I have squandered my share of delirium One has resources only for the absolutes of one s breed a soul like a country flourishes only within its frontiers I am paying for having crossed them for having made the Indefinite into a fatherland and foreign divinities into a cult for having prostrated myself before ages which excluded my ancestors Where I come from I can no longer say in the temples I am without belief in the cities without ardor among my kind without curiosity on the earth without certitudes Give me a specific desire and I could shake the world to its foundations Release me from this shame of actions which makes me perform every morning the farce of resurrection and every night that of entombment in the interval nothing but this torment in the shroud of ennui   I dream of wanting and all I want seems to me worthless Like a vandal corroded by melancholy I proceed without a goal self without a self toward some unknown corner    in order to discover an abandoned god a god who is his own atheist and to fall asleep in the shadow of his last doubts and his last miracles Ennui of Conquerors Paris weighed on Napoleon by his own admission like a leaden garment for which ten million men were to die This is the balance sheet of the mal du siede when a Rene on horseback becomes its agent Born of the idleness of the eighteenthcentury salons this disease in the indolence of an overlucid aristocracy extended its ravages deep into the countryside peasants were to pay with their blood for a mode of sensibility alien to their nature and with them a whole continent The exceptional natures in which Ennui insinuated itself horrified by any one place and obsessed by a perpetual elsewhere exploited the enthusiasm of the nations only to multiply their graveyards This condottiere who wept over Werther and Ossian this Obermann who projected his void into space and who according to Josephine was capable of no more than a few moments of abandon had as his unavowed mission to depopulate the earth The dreaming conqueror is the greatest calamity for men they are no less eager to idolize him fascinated as they are by distorted projects ruinous ideals unhealthy ambitions No reasonable being was ever the object of worship left a name or marked a single event with his individual stamp Imperturbable before a precise conception or a transparent idol the mob is roused by the unverifiable by false mysteries Who ever died in the name of rigor Each generation raises monuments to the executioners of the one which preceded it It is nonetheless true that the victims were willing enough to be immolated once they believed in glory in that victory of one man alone that defeat of all    Humanity adores only those who cause it to perish Reigns in which citizens died in their sleep do not figure in history nor the wise prince inveterately scorned by his subjects the crowd loves the fictive even at its expense the scandal of behavior constituting the web of human curiosity and the underground current of every event The unfaithful woman and the cuckold provide comedy and tragedy even the epic the quasitotality of their motifs Since virtue has neither biography nor charm from the Iliad to vaudeville only the luster of dishonor has entertained and intrigued Hence it is quite natural that humanity should have offered itself up to the conquerors that it should seek to be trampled underfoot that a nation without tyrants should never be talked about that the sum of iniquities a people commits should be the sole index of its presence and of its vitality A nation which no longer rapes is in its decadence the number of rapes reveals its instincts and its future Find out in which war it has stopped practicing on a large scale this variety of crime you will have found the first symbol of its decline find out at what moment love has become for a nation a ceremonial and the bed a condition of orgasm and you will identify the beginning of its deficiencies and the end of its barbaric inheritance Universal history history of Evil Take away the disasters from human evolution and you might as well conceive of nature without seasons If you have not contributed to a catastrophe you will vanish without a trace We interest others by the misfortune we spread around us I never made anyone suffer an exclamation forever alien to a creature of flesh and blood When we feel enthusiasm for a character of the past or the present we unconsciously ask ourselves For how many people was he the cause of disaster Who knows if each of us doesn t aspire to the privilege of killing all his kind But this privilege is assigned to very few and never integrally this restriction alone explains why the earth is still inhabited Indirect murderers we constitute an inert mass a multitude of objects confronting Time s true subjects the great criminals who came to something But we can take comfort our descendants remote or immediate will avenge us For it is not difficult to imagine the moment when men will cut each other s throats out of disgust with themselves when Ennui will get the best of their prejudices and their diffidences when they will run out into the street to slake their thirst for blood and when the destructive dream prolonged for so many generations will become the universal reality    Music and Skepticism I have searched for Doubt in all the arts have found it there only disguised furtive breaking out during the entractes of inspiration rising from slackened impulse but I have given up searching for it even in this form in music it cannot bloom there ignorant of irony music proceeds not from the pranks of the intellect but from the tender or vehement nuances of Naivete stupidity of the sublime heedlessness of the infinite    Wit having no equivalent in sound we denigrate a musician by calling him intelligent This attribute diminishes him and is not suitable in that languorous cosmogony where like a blind god he improvises one universe after another If he were conscious of his gift of his genius he would succumb to pride but he is not responsible for it born in the oracle he cannot understand himself Let the sterile interpret him he is not a critic as God is not a theologian Limitcase of unreality and the absolute infinitely real fiction a lie more authentic than the world music loses its prestige as soon as dry or morose we dissociate ourselves from the Creation and Bach himself seems no more than insipid rumors this is the extreme point of our nonparticipation in things of our coldness and our collapse To jeer amid the sublime sardonic victory of the subjective principle and one which makes us members of the Devil s brood Lost is the man who has no more tears for music who Eves now only by the memory of those he has shed sterile lucidity will have vanquished ecstasy which once created worlds    The Automaton I breathe out of prejudice And I contemplate the spasm of ideas while the Void smiles at itself    No more sweat in space no more life the least vulgarity will make it reappear a second s waiting will suffice When we perceive ourselves existing we have the sensation of a stupefied madman who surprises his own lunacy and vainly seeks to give it a name Habituacion blunts our amazement at being we are and move on we go back to our place in the asylum of the existing A conformist I live I try to live by imitation by respect for the rules of the game by horror of originality An automaton s resignation to affect a pretense of fervor and secretly to laugh at it to bow to conventions only to repudiate them on the sly to be numbered in every ledger but to have no residence in time to save face whereas it would be only duty to lose it    The man who scorns everything must assume an air of perfect dignity deceive the others and even himself thereby he will the more easily accomplish his task of counterfeit living What use displaying your failure when you can feign prosperity Hell lacks manners it is the exasperated image of a frank and uncouth man it is the earth conceived without one superstition of elegance and civility I accept life out of politeness perpetual rebellion is in bad taste as is the sublimity of suicide At twenty we rage against the heavens and the filth they hide then we grow tired of it The tragic attitude suits only an extended and ridiculous puberty but it takes a thousand ordeals to achieve the histrionics of detachment The man who liberated from all the principles of custom lacks any gift as an actor is the archetype of wretchedness the ideally unhappy being No use constructing this model of ingenuousness life is tolerable only by the degree of mystification we endow it with Such a model would be the immediate rain of society the pleasure of communal life residing in the impossibility of giving free rein to the infinity of our ulterior motives It is because we are all impostors that we endure each other The man who does not consent to lie will see the earth shrink under his feet we are biologically obliged to the false No moral hero who is not childish ineffectual or inauthentic for true authenticity is the flaw in fraud in the proprieties of public flattery and secret defamation If our fellow men could be aware of our opinions about them love friendship and devotion would be forever erased from the dictionaries and if we had the courage to confront the doubts we timidly conceive about ourselves none of us would utter an I without shame Masquerade rules all the living from the troglodyte to the skeptic Since only the respect for appearances separates us from carrion it is death to consider the basis of things of beings let us abide by a more agreeable nothingness our constitution tolerates only a certain dosage of truth    Let us keep deep down inside a certitude superior to all the others life has no meaning it cannot have any such thing We should kill ourselves on the spot if an unlooked for revelation persuaded us of the contrary The air gone we should still breathe but we should immediately smother if the joy of inanity were taken from us    On Melancholy When we cannot be delivered from ourselves we delight in devouring ourselves In vain we call upon the Lord of Shades the bestower of a precise curse we are invalids without disease and reprobates without vices Melancholy is the dream state of egoism no longer any object outside oneself no reason for hate or love but that same fall into a languid mud that same circling of the damned without a hell those same reiterations of a zeal to perish    Whereas sadness is content with a circumstantial context melancholy requires a debauch of space an infinite landscape in order to spread out its sullen and vaporous grace its shapeless evil which fearing to recover dreads any limit to its dissolution and its undulation It expands strangest flower of selflove among the poisons from which it extracts its vital juices and the vigor of all its failures Feeding on what corrupts it melancholy hides under its melodious name SelfCommiseration and the Pride of Defeat  The Thirst for Power A Caesar is closer to a village mayor than to a mind sovereignly lucid but lacking the instinct of domination The important fact is to command almost all men aspire to this Whether you have in your hands an empire a tribe a family or a servant you deploy your talent as a tyrant glorious or absurd a whole world or a single person obeys your orders Thus is established the series of calamities which rise from the need the thirst to excel    We jostle none but satraps each of us according to his means seeks out a host of slaves or is content with just one No one is selfsufficient the most modest of men will always find a friend or a companion to authenticate his dream of authority The man who obeys will be obeyed in his turn the victim will become the executioner this is the supreme desire universally Only beggars and sages do not experience it unless theirs is an even subtler game   The thirst for power permits History to renew itself and yet to remain basically the same religions try to oppose this appetite but manage only to exasperate it Christianity would have found an issue whether the earth was a desert or a paradise Under the variable forms man can assume is concealed one constant an identical basis which explains why against all the appearances of change we move in a circle and why if we lost following some supernatural intervention our quality as monsters and clowns history would immediately vanish Try to be free you will die of hunger Society tolerates you only if you are successively servile and despotic it is a prison without guards but from which you do not escape without dying Where to go when you can live only in the city and you lack the instincts for doing so and when you are not enterprising enough to beg your bread nor balanced enough to give yourself up to wisdom In the end you stay there like everyone else pretending to busy yourself you convince yourself of this extremity by the resources of artifice since it is less absurd to simulate life than to live it As long as men have the passion of the city a disguised cannibalism will rule there The political instinct is the direct consequence of Sin the immediate materialization of the Fall Each man should be assigned to his solitude but each man keeps an eye on that of everyone else Angels and bandits have their leaders how could the intermediary creatures the very texture of humanity lack theirs Take away their desire to be slaves or tyrants and you demolish the city in the wink of an eye The monkeypact is sealed forever and history follows its course the horde gasping between crimes and dreams Nothing can arrest it even those who execrate it participate in its progress    Position of the Poor Owners and beggars two categories which oppose any change any renewing disorder Placed at the two extremities of the social ladder they fear any modification in good and evil they are equally settled the former in opulence the latter in destitution Between diem are located anonymous sweat the basis of society those who strive labor persevere and cultivate the absurdity of hope The State feeds on their anemia the notion of citizen would have neither content nor reality without them any more than luxury and alms the rich man and the beggar are parasites of the poor the Pauper s dependents If misery has a thousand remedies poverty has none How succor those who persist in not dying of hunger God himself could not correct their lot Between fortune s darlings and the tatterdemalion circulate these honorable starvelings exploited by splendor and by rags pillaged by those who loathing labor settle according to their luck or their vocation in the salon or the gutter And so humanity advances with a few rich men with a few beggars and with all its poor     FACES OF DECADENCE The weariness of longforgotten peoples Hangs heavy on my eyelids Hugo von Hofmannsthal A civilization begins to decline the moment Life becomes its sole obsession Epochs of apogee cultivate values for their own sake life is only a means of realizing them the individual is not aware of living he lives happy slave of the forms he engenders tends and idolizes Affectivity dominates and fills him No creation without the resources of feeling which are limited yet for the man who experiences only their wealth they seem inexhaustible this illusion produces history In decadence affective dryingup permits only two modalities of feeling and understanding sensation and idea Now it is by affectivity that we participate in the world of values that we project a vitality into categories and norms The activity of a productive civilization consists in drawing ideas out of their abstract nothingness in transforming concepts into myths The transition from the anonymous individual to the conscious individual has not yet been made yet it is inevitable Measure it in Greece from Homer to the sophists in Rome from the austere old Republic to the wisdoms of the Empire in the modern world from the cathedrals to eighteenthcentury lace A nation cannot create indefinitely It is oiled upon to give expression and meaning to a sum of values which are exhausted with the soul which has begotten them The citizen wakens from a productive hypnosis the reign of lucidity begins the masses wield no more than empty categories Myths turn back into concepts that is decadence And the consequences make themselves felt the individual wants to live he converts life into finality he elevates himself to the rank of a minor exception The ledger of these exceptions constituting the deficit of a civilization prefigures its effacement Everyone achieves delicacy but is it not the radiant stupidity of the dolts which accomplishes the work of the great periods According to Montesquieu at the end of the Empire the Roman army consisted entirely of cavalry But he neglects to supply us with the reason for this Imagine the legionary saturated with glory wealth and debauchery after having traversed countless lands and having lost his faith and his force on contact with so many temples and vices imagine such a man on foot He has conquered the world as an infantryman he will lose it on horseback Indolence invariably reveals a physiological incapacity to adhere any longer to the myths of the City The emancipated soldier and the lucid citizen succumb to the barbarian The discovery of Life annihilates life When an entire nation at various levels is in search of rare sensations when by the subtleties of taste it complicates its reflexes it has acceded to a fatal pitch of superiority Decadence is merely instinct gone impure under the action of consciousness Hence we cannot overestimate the importance of gastronomy in the existence of a collectivity The conscious act of eating is an Alexandrian phenomenon barbarism feeds Intellectual and religious eclecticism sensual ingenuity aestheticism and the learned obsession of good living are the various signs of one and the same form of mind When Gabius Apicius explored the African coast for lobsters without settling anywhere because he found none to his taste he was a contemporary of the uneasy souls who worshipped the host of alien gods without finding satisfaction or rest among them Rare sensations diverse deities parallel fruits of the same dryness of the same curiosity without inner resources Christianity appeared a single God and fasting And an age of triviality and the Sublime began    A nation dies when it no longer has the strength to invent new gods new myths new absurdities its idols blur and vanish it seeks them elsewhere and feels alone before unknown monsters This too is decadence But if one of these monsters prevails another world sets itself in motion crude dim intolerant until it exhausts its god and emancipates itself from him for man is free and sterile only in the interval when the gods die slave and creative only in the interval when as tyrants they flourish To meditate upon one s sensations to know one is eating is an accession of consciousness by which an elementary action transcends its immediate goal Alongside intellectual disgust develops another deeper and more dangerous emanating from the viscera it ends at the severest form of nihilism the nihilism of repletion The bitterest considerations cannot compare in their effects with the vision following an opulent banquet Every meal which exceeds in time a few minutes and in dishes the necessities disintegrates our certitudes Culinary abuse and satiety destroyed the Empire more pitilessly than the Oriental sects and the illassimilated Greek doctrines We experience an authentic shudder of skepticism only around a copious table The Kingdom of Heaven must have represented a temptation after such excesses or a deliciously perverse surprise in the monotony of digestion Hunger seeks a way to salvation in religion satiety a poison To be saved by viruses and in the indiscrimination of prayers and vices to flee the world and wallow in it by the same action    that is indeed the apex of acrimony and of Alexandrianism There is a plenitude of decline in every overripe civilization Instincts slacken pleasures dilate and no longer correspond to their biological function the voluptuous becomes an end in itself its prolongation an art the avoidance of orgasm a technique sexuality a science Methods and literary inspirations to multiply the channels of desire the imagination tormented in order to diversify the preliminaries of release the mind itself involved in a realm alien to its nature and over which it should have no purchase all so many symptoms of the impoverishment of the blood and the morbid intellectualization of the flesh Love conceived as a ritual makes the intelligence sovereign in the empire of stupidity Our automatisms suffer for it shackled they lose that impatience to let loose an inadmissible contortion the nerves become the theater of lucid discomforts and shudders sensation in short extends beyond its crude duration thanks to the skill of two torturers of studied voluptuousness They are the individual who deceives the species and the blood too tepid to stun the mind the blood chilled and thinned by ideas the rational blood    Instincts eroded by conversation    Nothing monumental has ever emerged from dialogue nothing explosive nothing great If humanity had not indulged in discussing its own strength it would never have exceeded Homer s vision and his models But dialectics ravaging the spontaneity of reflexes and the spirit of myths has reduced the hero to a tottering example Today s Achilles has more than a heel to worry about    Vulnerability once partial and of no consequence has become the accursed privilege the essence of each being Consciousness has made its way everywhere residing in the very marrow of our bones hence man no longer lives in existence but in the theory of existence    The clearsighted person who understands himself explains himself justifies himself and dominates his actions will never make a memorable gesture Psychology is the hero s grave The millennia of religion and reasoning have weakened muscles decisions and the impulse of risk How keep from scorning the enterprises of glory Every act over which the mind s luminous malediction fails to preside represents a vestige of ancestral stupidity Ideologies were invented only to give a luster to the leftover barbarism which has survived down through the ages to cover up the murderous tendencies common to all men Today we kill in the name of something we no longer dare do so spontaneously so that the very executioners must invoke motives and heroism being obsolete the man who is tempted by it solves a problem more than he performs a sacrifice Abstraction has insinuated itself into life and into death the complexes seize great and small alike From the Iliad to psychopathobgy there you have all of human history In civilizations on the wane twilight is the sign of a noble punishment What ecstasy of irony they must experience upon seeing themselves excluded from Becoming after having established for centuries the norms of power and the criteria of taste With each of them a whole world goes out Sensations of the last Greek the last Roman Who can keep from falling in love with the great sunsets The charm of agony surrounding a civilization after it has confronted every problem and marvelously warped them offers more seductions than the inviolate ignorance by which that civilization began Each civilization represents an answer to the questions the universe proposes but the mystery remains intact new civilizations with new curiosities will come to try their luck quite as vainly each of them being merely a system of mistakes    At the apogee we beget values at twilight worn and defeated we abolish them Fascination of decadence of the ages when the truths have no further life    when they pile up like skeletons in the desiccated pensive soul in the boneyard of dreams    How dear to me that Alexandrian philosopher named Olimpius who hearing a voice singing the Hallelujah in the Serapion went into exile forever This was toward the end of the fourth century already the lugubrious stupidity of the Cross was casting its shadows across the Mind Around the same period Palladas the grammarian could write We Greeks are no more than ashes today Our hopes are buried like those of the dead And this is true for all intellects of that time Vainly a Celsus a Porphyry a Julian the Apostate strives to halt the invasion of that nebulous Sublime which overflows the catacombs the apostles have left their stigmata in men s souls and multiplied their ravages in the cities The age of the great Ugliness begins hysteria without quality spreads over the world Saint Paul the most considerable votecanvasser of all time has made his tours infesting the clarity of the ancient twilight with his epistles An epileptic triumphs over five centuries of philosophy Reason is confiscated by the fathers of the Church And if I were to look for the most mortifying date for the mind s pride if I were to scan the inventory of intolerances I would find nothing comparable to the year  when following Justinian s decree the School of Athens was closed The right to decadence being officially suppressed to believe became an obligation    This is the most painful moment in the history of Doubt When a nation no longer has any prejudice in its blood its sole resource remains its will to disintegrate Imitating music that discipline of dissolution it makes its farewells to the passions to lyric waste to sentimentality to blindness Henceforth it can no longer worship without irony the sense of distances will be its lot forever Prejudice is an organic truth false in itself but accumulated by generations and transmitted we cannot rid ourselves of it with impunity The nation that renounces it heedlessly will then renounce itself until it has nothing left to give up The duration of a collectivity and its consistency coincide with the duration and consistency of its prejudices The Oriental nations owe their everlastingness to their loyalty to themselves having failed to develop they have not betrayed themselves and they have not lived in the sense in which life is conceived by civilizations on the run the only ones history is concerned with for history discipline of dawns and of gasping deathbeds history is a novel laying claim to rigor and which draws its substance from the archives of the blood    Alexandrianism is a period of skilful negations a style of inutility and refusal a display of erudition and sarcasm above the confusion of values and beliefs Its ideal space would be at the intersection of Hellas and bygone Paris the meeting place of the agora and the salon A civilization evolves from agriculture to paradox Between these two extremes unfolds the combat of barbarism and neurosis from it results the unstable equilibrium of creative epochs This combat is approaching its close all horizons are opening without any being able to excite an exhausted and disabused curiosity It is then up to the enlightened individual to flourish in the void up to the intellectual vampire to slake his thirst on the vitiated blood of civilizations Must we take history seriously or stand on the sidelines as a spectator Are we to see it as a struggle toward a goal or the celebration of a light which intensifies and fades with neither necessity nor reason The answer depends on our degree of illusion about man on our curiosity to divine the way in which will be resolved that mixture of waltz and slaughterhouse which composes and stimulates his becoming There is a Weltschmerz a mal du sieck which is merely the illness of a generation there is another which follows upon all historical experience and which becomes the unavoidable conclusion for the time to come This is what the French call vague a lame a melancholy yearning for the end of the world Everything changes its aspect even the sun everything ages even disaster    Incapable of rhetoric we are romantics of lucid disappointment Today Werther Manfred Rene know their disease and display it without ceremony Biology physiology psychology grotesque names which suppressing the naivete of our despair and introducing analysis into our songs bring us to scorn all declamation Disciplined by the various Treatises our scholarly acerbities explain our shames and classify our frenzies When consciousness succeeds in sounding all our secrets when our misery has been drained of its last vestige of mystery will we still have any fever and exaltation left to contemplate the wreck of existence and of poetry To bear the weight of history the burden of becoming and that load under which consciousness sags when it considers the sum and the inanity of past or possible events   In vain nostalgia invokes an impulse ignorant of the lessons taught by all that has ever been there is a weariness for which the future itself is a cemetery a potential cemetery as is everything which awaits being The centuries have grown heavy and weigh upon the moment We are more corrupt than all the ages more decomposed than all the empires Our exhaustion interprets history our breathlessness makes us hear the death rattle of nations Chlorotic comedians we prepare ourselves for the standin parts in the hackneyed stories the wellworn periods the curtain of the universe is motheaten and through its holes we see nothing now but masks and ghosts    The mistake of those who apprehend decadence is to try to oppose it whereas it must be encouraged by developing it exhausts itself and permits the advent of other forms The true harbinger is not the man who offers a system when no one wants it but rather the man who precipitates Chaos its agent and incensebearer It is vulgar to trumpet dogmas in extenuated ages when any dream of the future seems a dream or an imposture To make for the end of time with a flower in one s buttonhole the sole comportment worthy of us in time s passage A pity there is no such thing as a Last Judgment no occasion for a great defiance Believers hamfatters of eternity faith craving for a timeless stage    But we unbelievers we die with our decors and too tired out to deceive ourselves with blazonry promised to our corpses    According to Meister Eckhart divinity precedes God being His essence his unfathomable depth What should we find at man s inmost core which defines his substance in opposition to the divine essence Neurasthenia which is to man what divinity is to God We live in a climate of exhaustion the act of creation of making and producing is less significant in and of itself than in relation to the void to the fall which follows    For our invariably compromised efforts the divine and inexhaustible depths are situated outside the field of our concepts and our sensations Man was born with the vocation of fatigue when he adopted the vertical posture and thereby diminished his possibilities of support he was doomed to weaknesses unknown to the animal he was To carry on two legs so much substance and all the disgusts related to it The generations accumulate weariness and transmit it our fathers bequeath to us a patrimony of anemia reserves of discouragement resources of decomposition and an energy in dying which becomes more powerful than our instincts to live And it is in this fashion that the habitude of disappearing propped on our capital of fatigue will permit us to realize in the prolix flesh neurasthenia our essence    No need to believe in a truth to sustain it nor to love a period to justify it every principle being demonstrable and every event legitimate The sum of phenomena whether fruits of the mind or of time can be embraced or denied according to our mood of the moment arguments proceeding from our rigor or from our whims are of equal weight on each point Nothing is indefensible from the absurdest proposition to the most monstrous crime The history of ideas like that of deeds unfolds in a meaningless climate who could in good faith find an arbiter who would settle the litigations of these anemic or bloodthirsty gorillas This earth a place where we can confirm anything with an equal likelihood here axioms and frenzies are interchangeable impulses and collapses are identified exaltations and depravities participate in the same movement Show me a single case in support of which nothing can be found    The advocates of hell have no fewer claims on the truth than those of heaven and I should plead the cause of madman and sage with the same fervor Time deals corruption to all that manifests itself all that acts an idea or an event becoming real assumes a countenance and    disintegrates Hence when the mob of beings was stirred History was the result and with it the one pure desire it has inspired that it come to an end one way or another Too mature for new dawns and having included too many centuries to crave more all that remains for us is to wallow in the slag of civilizations The march of time now seduces only the callow and the fanatic    We are the great invalids overwhelmed by old dreams forever incapable of utopia technicians of lassitude gravediggers of the future horrified by the avatars of the Old Adam The Tree of Life will no longer have spring as one of its seasons so much dry wood out of it will be made coffins for our bones our dreams and our griefs Our flesh inherited the smell of lovely carrion scattered in the millennia Their glory fascinated us we exhausted it In the Mind s graveyard lie the principles and the formulas the Beautiful is defined and interred there And like it the True the Good Knowledge and the Gods they are all rotting there History a context in which the capital letters decompose and with them the men who imagine and cherish them   I stroll there Under this cross Truth sleeps its last sleep beside it Charm further on Rigor and over a host of slabs covered with deliriums and hypotheses rises the mausoleum of the Absolute in it lie the false consolations and the deceptive zeniths of the soul But still higher crowning this silence soars Error and halts the steps of the funereal sophist Since man s existence is the most considerable and the strangest venture nature has known it is inevitable that it should also be the shortest its end is foreseeable and desirable to extend it indefinitely would be indecent Having entered upon the risks of his exception the paradoxical animal will still play for centuries and even for millennia his last card Must we complain of that No question that he will never equal his past glories nothing suggests that his possibilities will some day provoke a rival for Bach or for Shakespeare Decadence is first manifest in the arts civilization survives their decomposition a certain time Such will be man s case he will continue his exploits but his spiritual resources will have dried up as will his freshness of inspiration The thirst for power and domination has taken over too much of his soul when he is master of all he will be none the more so of his owe end Not yet being the possessor of all the means to destroy and to destroy himself he will not perish forthwith but it is indubitable that he will create for himself an instrument of total annihilation before discovering a panacea which moreover does not appear to be one of nature s possibilities He will annihilate himself as a creator are we to conclude that all men will vanish from the earth We must not look at the situation through rosecolored glasses A good proportion the survivors will linger on a race of subhumans gatecrashers of the apocalypse   The imagination readily conceives a future in which men will exclaim in chorus We are the last weary of the future and even wearier of ourselves we have squeezed out the juice from the earth and stripped bare the heavens Neither spirit nor matter can still nourish our dreams this universe is as desiccated as our hearts No substance remains anywhere our ancestors bequeathed us their tattered soul and their wormeaten marrow The venture is at an end consciousness is expiring our songs have fallen still there gleams the sun of the dying If by accident or miracle words were to disappear we should be plunged into an intolerable anguish and stupor Such sudden dumbness would expose us to the crudest torment It is the use of concepts which makes us masters of our fears We say Death and this abstraction releases us from experiencing its infinity its horror By baptizing events and things we elude the Inexplicable the mind s activity is a salutary deception a conjuring trick it allows us to circulate in a tempered reality comfortable and inexact To learn to wield concepts unlearn to look at things    Reflection was born on a day of evasion the consequence was verbal splendor But when we return to ourselves and we are alone without the company of words we rediscover the unqualified universe the pure object the naked event where find the boldness to face them We no longer speculate about death we are death instead of embellishing life and assigning it goals we strip it of its finery and reduce it to its true meaning a euphemism for Evil The grand expressions fate misfortune disgrace lose their luster and it is then that we see the creature at grips with failing organs vanquished under a prostrate and dumbfounded substance Take the lie of Misery away from man give him the power to look under this word he cannot for one moment endure his misery It is abstraction sonorities without content swollen and dilapidated which have kept him from foundering and not his religions and instincts When Adam was expelled from paradise instead of vituperating his persecutor he busied himself baptizing things this was his sole way of accommodating himself to them and forgetting them the basis of idealism was established And what was only a gesture a defense reaction in the first stammerer became theory in Plato Kant and Hegel In order not to be overwhelmed by our accident we convert even our name into an entity how can we die when we are called Peter or Paul Each of us more attentive to the immutable appearance of his name than to the fragility of his being gives himself up to an illusion of immortality once the articulation blurs we are quite alone the mystic who weds silence has renounced his creature condition Imagine him further without faith a nihilist mystic and we have the disastrous consummation of the earthly venture   It is only too natural to think that man weary of words impatient with the iterations of time will debaptize things and cast their names and his own into a great autodafe that will engulf his hopes We all race toward this final model toward man mute and naked    I feel Life s age its old age its decrepitude For incalculable epochs Life has circled the surface of the globe by the miracle of that false immortality which is inertia it has lingered in the rheumatisms of Time in that time older than itself exhausted by a senile delirium by the endless sifting of its moments of its doting duration And I feel all the weight of the race and I have assumed all its solitude If only it would vanish but its agony extends toward an eternity of corruption I leave each moment the latitude to destroy me not to blush at breathing is the act of a cad No more pacts with life no more pacts with death having unlearned being I consent to be effaced Becoming what a crime Having passed through so many lungs the air no longer renews itself Every day vomits up its tomorrow and I vainly try to imagine the image of a single desire Everything is an ordeal broken down like a beast of burden harnessed to Matter I drag the planets Give me another universe or I succumb All I like is the explosion and the collapse of things the fire which provokes them and the fire which devours them The world s duration exasperates me its birth and its disappearance delight   To live under the fascination of the virginal sun and the decrepit one to skip the pulsations of time in order to grasp the original one and the ultimate   to dream of the improvisation of the stars and of their extinction to disdain the routine of being and to rush toward the two abysses which threaten it to exhaust oneself at the beginning and at the conclusion of the moments   Thus one discovers the Savage and the Decadent in oneself a predestined and contradictory cohabitation two characters suffering the same attraction for passage the one of nothingness toward the world the other of the world toward nothingness it is the need for a double convulsion on the metaphysical scale This need is expressed on the historical scale in the obsession of Adam whom paradise expelled and in the obsession of the man whom earth will expel two extremities of man s impossibility By what is profound in us we are victims of every evil no salvation so long as we still conform to our being Something must disappear from our composition some deadly spring dry up hence there is only one way out to abolish the soul its aspirations and abysses our dreams were poisoned by it we must extirpate it along with its craving for depth its inner fruitfulness and its other aberrations The mind and sensation will suffice their concourse will beget a discipline of sterility which will preserve us from enthusiasm from anguish Let no feeling disturb us ever again and let the soul become the silliest of desuetudes     SANCTITY AND THE GRIMACES OF THE ABSOLUTE The Refusal to

surviving in someone else to whom moreover he has nothing more to transmit the species appalls him he is a monster and monsters do not beget Love still holds him prisoner an aberration among his thoughts In love he seeks an excuse to return to the common condition but the child seems as inconceivable to him as the family as heredity as the laws of nature With neither profession nor lineage he achieves final hypostasis his own conclusion But far as he may be from fecundity a more audacious monster outstrips him the saint an example at once fascinating and repellent with whom we are always in a false position his own is clear no room for doubt no possible dilettantism Having reached the gilded peaks of his disgusts at the antipodes of Creation he has made his nothingness into a halo Nature has never known such a calamity from the viewpoint of perpetuation the saint marks an absolute end a radical denouement To regret like Leon Bloy that we are not all saints is to crave humanity s disappearance    in the name of faith How positive on the other hand the devil appears striving to seal us to our imperfections and laboring despite himself betraying his essence to preserve us Root out sins and life withers at once The follies of procreation will one day vanish out of weariness rather than sanctity Man will be exhausted less for having tended to perfection than for having squandered himself then he will resemble a void saint and he will be just as far from nature s fruitfulness as is this model of fulfillment and sterility Man engenders only by remaining faithful to the general fate Once he approaches the essence of the devil or of the angel he becomes sterile or begets abortions For Easkoleikov for Ivan Karamazov or Stavrogin love is no longer anything but an excuse to accelerate their destruction and this very excuse vanishes for Kirilov he no longer measures himself against men but against God As for the Idiot or Alyosha the fact that the one apes Jesus and the other the angels places them from the start among the impotent    But to wrest ourselves from the chain of beings and to reject the notion of ancestry or posterity is nonetheless not to compete with the saint whose pride exceeds any earthly dimension Indeed under the decision by which he renounces everything under the incommensurable exploit of such humility is concealed a demonic effervescence the initial point the start of sanctity assumes the style of a challenge hurled at the human race subsequently the saint climbs the ladder of perfection begins talking about love about God turns toward the humble intrigues the mob and annoys us The fact nonetheless remains that he has thrown down his gauntlet    The hatred of the race and of its genius relates you to murderers to madmen to divinities and to all the great forms of the sterile Starting from a certain degree of solitude you must leave off loving and committing the fascinating pollution of intercourse The man who wants to perpetuate himself at any price is scarcely to be distinguished from the dog he is still nature he will never understand that we can endure the empire of the instincts and rebel against them enjoy the advantages of the species and scorn them end of the line with appetites    That is the conflict of the man who worships and abominates woman supremely torn between the attraction and disgust she inspires Hence unable to renounce the race altogether he resolves this conflict by dreaming on her breast of the desert and by mingling the scent of the cloisters with the stench of overexplicit sweat The insincerities of the flesh bring him closer to the saints    Solitude of hatred    sensation of a god turned toward destruction treading the spheres Underfoot slobbering on the blue of heaven and its constellations    of a frenzied filthy unhealthy god the demiurge ejecting through space paradise and latrines cosmogony of delirium tremens convulsive apotheosis in which gall consummates the elements    The creatures hurl themselves toward an archetype of ugliness and sigh for an ideal of deformity    Universe of grimaces jubilation of the mole the hyena and the louse    No horizon left except for monsters and vermin Everything makes for disgust and gangrene this globe suppurating while the living display their wounds under the beams of that luminous chancre    The Aesthete Hagiographer It is no sign of benediction to have been haunted by the existence of the saints This obsession is tainted by a thirst for diseases and a greed for depravities You are disturbed about sanctity only if you have been disappointed by the earthly paradoxes so then you search for others of a stranger purport imbued with unknown perfumes and truths you put your hopes in follies not to be found in everyday sensations follies heavy with a celestial exoticism and so you come up against the saints their gestures their temerity their universe Astounding spectacle You vow to remain here all your life to examine it with a voluptuous devotion to wrest yourself from other temptations because at last you have met with the true and the unheard of Behold the aesthete turned hagiographer making his scholarly pilgrimage    He makes it without suspecting that it is no more than a promenade and that everything in this world disappoints even sanctity    The Disciple of Certain Saints There was a time when to pronounce merely the name of a saint a saint who happened to be a woman filled me with pleasure when I envied the chroniclers of the convents the intimates of so many ineffable hysterias so many illuminations and pallors I considered that to be the secretary of such a woman such a saint would constitute the highest career a mortal man could enjoy And I would covet the confessor s role among these blessed enthusiasts and all the details all the secrets a Peter of Alvastra kept from us about Saint Bridget of Sweden Henry of Nordlingen about Mechthild of Magdeburg Raymond of Capua about Catherine of Siena Brother Arnold about Angela of Foligno Johann of Marienwerder about Dorothea of Montau Clemens Brentano about Catherine Emmerich    It seemed to me that a Diodata degli Ademari or a Diana of Andolo rose up to heaven by the simple glamor of their names they gave me the sensual taste for another world When I mused on the ordeals of Rose of Lima of Lydwina of Schiedam of Catherine dei Ricci and of so many others when I thought of their refinement of cruelty toward themselves of the deliberate mortification of their charms and graces  detested the parasite of their pangs the unscrupulous Bridegroom insatiable and celestial Don Juan who had the right of first tenant in their hearts Exasperated by the sighs and sweats of earthly love I turned to these women if only for their pursuit of another mode of loving If but one drop of what I feel said Catherine of Genoa were to fall into Hell it would forthwith transform Hell into Paradise I waited for that drop which had it fallen would have found me at the end of its trajectory    Murmuring over the exclamations of Teresa of Avila I heard her crying at the age of six eternity eternity then followed the development of her deliriums of her devotions of her desiccations Nothing more captivating than the private revelations which disconcert the dogmas and embarrass the Church    I should have liked to keep a journal of those equivocal avowals to browse on all those suspect nostalgias   It is not in a bed that the peaks of voluptuous pleasure are to be scaled how find in mere sublunary ecstasy what the saints let you suspect in their ravishment in their transports Bernini has shown us the quality of their secrets in his statue of the Spanish saint in Rome where Teresa incites us to so many considerations as to the ambiguity of her swoons    When I think again about my debts for an awareness of these extremities of passion these darkest yet purest raptures and that kind of absence when the nights catch fire when the merest blade of grass like the stars themselves dissolves into a voice of tonic intensity instantaneous infinity incandescent and sonorous as a radiant and demented god might conceive it when I think again about all this a single name haunts me Teresa of Avila and the words of one of her revelations I used to repeat to myself daily You must no longer speak with men but with angels I lived for years in the shadow of these women these saints believing that no poet sage or madman would ever equal them I expended in my fervor for them all my powers of worship my vitality in desire my ardor in dreams And then    I stopped loving them Wisdom and Sanctity Of all the great sufferers the saints are best at profiting from their sickness Willful unbridled natures they exploit their own disequilibrium with violence and skill The Savior their model was an example of ambition and audacity a matchless conqueror his insinuating force his power to identify himself with the soul s flaws and insufficiencies allowed him to establish a kingdom beyond the reach of any mere sword Ardent with method it is this ability which was imitated by those who took him for their ideal But the sage scornful of drama and display feels quite as remote from the saint as from the reveler knows nothing of the histrionic and forges for himself an equilibrium of disillusion and unconcern Pascal is a saint without temperament sickness has made him a little more than a sage a little less than a saint Which accounts for his oscillations and the skeptical shadow that follows his fervors A bel esprit in the Incurable    From the sage s viewpoint there can be no one more impure than the saint from the saint s no one emptier than the sage Here we have the whole difference between the man who understands and the man who aspires Woman and the Absolute While Our Lord spoke to me and I contemplated his marvelous beauty I noticed the sweetness and at times the severity with which his lovely and divine lips uttered the words I desired ardently to know the color of his eyes and the proportions of his stature that I might be able to speak of them but never have I deserved to have such knowledge All effort to that end is of no avail Saint Teresa The color of his eyes    Impurities of female sanctity To carry the indiscretion of her sex up to Heaven itself that is of a nature to console and compensate any man and better still any woman who has remained outside the divine adventure The first man the first woman that is the essence of the Fall which nothing genius nor sanctity will ever redeem Who has ever seen a new man totally superior to the one he was For Jesus himself the Transfiguration may have meant only a fugitive event a development without consequences    Between Saint Teresa and other women then there is no more than a difference in capacity for delirium a question of the intensity and direction of caprice Love human or divine levels human beings to love a girl or to love God presupposes the same movement in both cases you follow a creaturely impulse Only the object changes but what interest does it offer once it is merely a pretext for the need to worship once God is merely one outlet among so many others Spain Each nation translates the divine attributes into process in its own way yet Spain s ardor remains unique had the rest of the world shared it God would be exhausted drained and deprived of Himself It is in order not to vanish that he makes atheism prosper in His countries out of selfdefense Fearing the flames He has inspired He reacts against His sons against their frenzy which diminishes Him their love undermines His power and His authority only unbelief leaves Him intact it is not doubts which erode God but faith For centuries the Church has trivialized His prestige and by making Him accessible is preparing for Him thanks to theology a death without enigmas a glossed enlightened agony overwhelmed by the weight of prayers how could He help being still more so by that of explanations He dreads Spain as He dreads Russia and multiplies atheists in both Their attacks at least let Him retain the illusion of omnipotence still an attribute preserved But the believers Dostoyevsky El Greco has He ever had more feverish enemies And how could He keep from preferring Baudelaire to John of the Cross He fears those who see Him and those through whom He sees All sanctity is more or less Spanish if God were a cyclops Spain would be His eye Hysteria of Eternity I can concede a certain relish for the Cross but to reproduce and daily the stale event of Calvary that partakes of the wondrous the inane and the stupid For after all the Savior if we abuse his prestige is as tiresome as anyone else The saints were great perverts the women among them magnificent voluptuaries All of them frenzied by a single idea transformed the Cross into a vice Depth is the dimension of those who cannot vary their thoughts and their appetites and who explore a single region of pleasure and of pain Attentive to the fluctuation of the moments we cannot admit an absolute event Jesus cannot cut history in two nor the raising of the Cross break the impartial course of time Religious thought a form of obsessive thought subtracts a temporal portion from the sum of events and invests it with all the attributes of the unconditioned This is how the gods and their sons were possible    Life is the site of my infatuations everything I wrest from indifference I give back almost at once This is not the saints method they choose once and for all I live in order to leave off whatever I love they in order to commit themselves to a single object I savor eternity they sink themselves into it The wonders of the earth and a fortiori those of heaven result from a durable hysteria Sanctity earthquake of the heart annihilation by dint of belief culminating expression of fanatic sensibility transcendent deformity    Between the saved and the simpleminded there is more correspondence than between the saved and the skeptic That is the entire distance which divides faith from knowledge without hope from existence without results Stages of Pride Frequenting the saints madness you happen to forget your limits your chains your burdens and you exclaim I am the soul of the world I color the universe with my flames There will be no night from now on I have prepared the eternal banquet of the stars the sun is superfluous everything shines and the stones are lighter than angels wings Then between frenzy and contemplation If I am not this Soul at least I aspire to be it Have I not given my name to all things Every object proclaims me from the dungheaps to the vaults of heaven am I not the silence and the din of things    and at the lowest the intoxication past I am the grave of sparks the worms mockery a carrion importuning heaven a carnival parody of the Beyond a cidevant Nothing without even the privilege of ever having rotted What perfection of the abyss have I come to that there is no space left for me to fall in Heaven and Hygiene Sanctity supreme product of disease when we are well it seems monstrous unintelligible and morbid to the highest degree But let that automatic Hamletism we call Neurosis claim its dues and the heavens take shape and constitute the context of anxiety We protect ourselves against sanctity by taking care of ourselves it proceeds from a special filth of the body and of the soul If Christianity had proposed hygiene instead of the Unverifiable we should seek in vain for a single saint in all its history but it has championed our wounds and our squalor an intrinsic phosphorescent squalor    Health decisive weapon against religion Invent the universal elixir the heavens will vanish and never return No use seducing man by other ideals they will be weaker than diseases God is our rust the gradual decay of our substance when He penetrates us we think we are elevated but we descend lower and lower having reached our end He crowns our collapse and so we are saved forever Sinister superstition haloed cancer which has eaten away the earth for ages    I hate all gods I am not healthy enough to scorn them That is the Indifferent Man s great humiliation On Certain Solitudes There are hearts God cannot look into without losing His innocence Sadness began after the Creation had the Creator ventured further into the world He would have compromised His equilibrium The man who believes he can still die has not known certain solitudes nor the inevitability of immortality perceived in certain pangs    It is our modern specialty to have localized hell in ourselves had we preserved its old countenance fear sustained by two thousand years of threats would have petrified us There are no longer any dreads which are not transposed subjectively psychology is our salvation our subterfuge In the old days this world was supposed to emerge from one of the devil s yawns today it is only a mistake of the senses a prejudice of the mind a vice of the emotions We know what we can do with Saint Hildegarde s vision of the Last Judgment or Saint Teresa s of Hell the sublime the Sublime of horror like that of holiness is classified by any treatise on mental diseases And if our ills are known to us we are not thereby exempt from visions but we no longer believe in them Expert in the chemistry of mysteries we explain everything even our tears This however remains inexplicable if the soul is of such little account where does the feeling of our solitude come from what space does it occupy And how does it suddenly replace the huge vanished reality Oscillation In vain you search for your model among human beings from those who have gone farther than you you have borrowed only the compromising and harmful aspect from the sage sloth from the saint incoherence from the aesthete rancor from the poet profligacy and from all disagreement with yourself ambiguity in everyday things and hatred for what lives simply to live Pure you regret filth sordid seemliness vague vigor You will never be anything but what you are not and the despair of being what you are With what contrasts was your substance imbued and what mingled genius presided over your relegation in the world Determination to diminish yourself has made you espouse in others their appetite for collapse in this musician this disease in this prophet this defect and in women poets libertines or saints their melancholy their vitiated spirits their corruption of flesh and blood and dreams Bitterness principle of your determination your mode of action and understanding is the one fixed point in your oscillation between disgust for the world and selfpity Threat of Sanctity Able to live only beyond or short of life man is a prey to two temptations imbecility and sanctity subman and superman never himself But whereas he does not suffer from the fear of being less than what he is the prospect of being more terrifies him Committed to pain he dreads its conclusion how could he consent to founder in that abyss of perfection which is sanctity and there lose his own control To slide toward imbecility or toward sanctity is to let yourself be lured outside yourself Yet we are not alarmed by the loss of consciousness implied by the approach of idiocy while the prospect of perfection is inseparable from vertigo It is by imperfection that we are superior to God and it is the fear of losing it which makes us flee sanctity The terror of a future in which we shall no longer be in despair   in which at the term of our disasters another unlonged for would appear die terror of salvation the terror of becoming saints    The man who adores his imperfections is frightened of a transfiguration which his sufferings might prepare for him To vanish in a transcendent light    Better then to make for the absolute of darkness toward the comforts of imbecility    The Tilting Cross Sublime hodgepodge Christianity is too profound and above all too impure to last any longer its centuries are numbered Jesus fades from day to day his precepts like his mildness vex his miracles and his divinity make us smile The Cross tilts the symbol is turning back into substance    back into the order of that decomposition in which without exception honorable and unworthy things die Two thousand years of success A fabulous resignation on the part of the most fretful animal of all    but our patience is exhausted The notion that I could like everyone else be sincerely Christian if only a second casts me into perplexity The Savior bores me I dream of a universe exempt from celestial intoxications of a universe with neither Cross nor faith Who can fail to see the moment coming when there will be no more religion when man lucid and empty will have no word on hand to designate his abyss The Unknown will be as dull as the known everything will lack interest and flavor On the ruins of Knowledge a sepulchral lethargy will make us all into specters lunar heroes of Incuriosity    Theology I am in a good mood God is good I am sullen God is wicked I am indifferent He is neutral My states confer upon Him corresponding attributes when I love knowledge He is omniscient and when I worship power omnipotent When things seem to me to exist He exists when they seem illusory He evaporates A thousand arguments sustain Him and a thousand destroy if my enthusiasms animate Him my sulks smother Him We cannot form a more variable image we fear Him as a monster and crush him like a worm we idolize Him He is Being repel Him He is Nothingness Were Prayer to supplant Gravity it would scarcely assure His universal duration He would still remain at the mercy of our moments His fate has decided that He be unchangeable only in the eyes of the naive or the retarded Scrutiny reveals Him useless cause meaningless absolute patron of dolts pastime of solitaries straw or specter according to whether he amuses our mind or haunts our fevers I am generous He swells with attributes sour He is heavy with absence I have experienced Him in all His forms He resists neither curiosity nor inspection His mystery His infinity declines his luster dims his prestige diminishes He is a worn costume we must strip off how still drape ourselves in a tattered God His degradation His agony drag on through the ages but He will not outlive us He is aging His last gasps will precede ours Once His attributes are exhausted no one will have the energy to forge Him new ones and the creature having assumed then rejected them will go and rejoin in nothingness Ms loftiest invention his Creator The Metaphysical Animal If we could eliminate everything Neurosis has inscribed in the mind and the heart all the morbid marks it has left there all the impure shadows accompanying it What is not superficial is unclean God fruit of the anxiety of our guts and the gurgle of our ideas    Only aspiration to the Void saves us from that exercise of corruption which is the act of belief What limpidity in the Art of appearance in the indifference to our ends and our disasters To think of God to seek Him to invoke or to endure Him movements of a disordered body and a defeated mind The nobly superficial ages the Renaissance the eighteenth century scorned religion dismissed its rudimentary frolics But alas There is a plebeian melancholy in us which darkens our fervors and our concepts Vainly we dream of a lace universe God product of our depths our gangrene profanes this dream of beauty We are metaphysical animals by the corruption we harbor in ourselves History of thought procession of our lapses life of the Mind parade of our vertigo When our health declines the universe suffers for it and must follow the descending curve of our vitality Endlessly harping on the why and the how tracing the Cause and all causes on the slightest pretext denotes a disorder of the functions and faculties which ends in a metaphysical delirium senility of the abyss downfall of anguish ultimate ugliness of the mysteries   Genesis of Melancholy Every profound dissatisfaction is of a religious nature our failures derive from our incapacity to conceive of paradise and to aspire to it as our discomforts from the fragility of our relations with the absolute I am an incomplete religious animal I suffer all ills doubly an adage of the Fall which man keeps repeating to comfort himself Failing to do so he appeals to ethics decides to follow at the risk of ridicule edifying advice Resolve to be melancholy no longer ethics replies And man strives to enter the universe of Good of WellBeing of Hope    But his efforts are ineffectual and against nature melancholy harks back to the root of our ruin    melancholy is the poetry of original sin    Divagations in a Monastery For the unbeliever infatuated with waste and dispersion there is no spectacle more disturbing than these ruminants of the absolute    Where do they find such pertinacity in the unverifiable so much attention in the vague and so much ardor to apprehend it as well I share neither their certitudes nor their serenity They are happy and I blame them for being so If at least they hated themselves but they prize their soul more than the universe this false evaluation is the source of sacrifices and renunciations of an imposing absurdity Whereas our experiences have neither sequence nor system being at the mercy of chance and our moods they have but one experience always the same of a monotony and a profundity which are profoundly disheartening It is true that God is its object but what interest can they still take in Him Always equal to Himself infinitely of the same nature He never renews Himself I could reflect upon Him in passing but to fill the hours with Him    It is not yet daylight From my cell I hear voices and the ageold refrains offerings to a banal Latin heaven Earlier in the night steps hastened toward the chapel Matins Even if God Himself were to attend His own celebration I would not get out of bed on a night this cold But in any case He has to exist otherwise these sacrifices of creatures of flesh shaking off their sloth to worship Him would be of such insanity that reason could not endure the thought The proofs of theology are futile compared to this exertion which perplexes the unbeliever and obliges him to attribute a meaning and a use to such efforts Unless he resigns himself to an aesthetic perspective of these deliberate insomnias and in the vanity of these vigils sees merely the most gigantic adventure the quest of a Beauty of nonmeaning and dread    The splendor of a prayer addressed to No One But something has to be when this Probable changes into certitude felicity is no longer a mere word so true is it that the only answer to nothingness lies in illusion How have they acquired this illusion labeled on the absolute level grace By what privilege were they led to hope what no hope in this world lets us glimpse By what right do they install themselves in an eternity which everything denies us By what subterfuge do these possessors the only true possessors I have ever encountered arrogate the mystery to themselves in order to delight in it thereby God belongs to them to attempt to sneak Him away would be futile they themselves know nothing of the method by which they have taken possession One fine day    they believed This one was converted by a simple appeal he believed without being conscious of it when he was he assumed the habit That one suffered every torment they ceased before a sudden light One cannot will faith like a disease it insinuates itself in you or strikes you down no one can command it and it is absurd to long for it if you are not predestined to it You are a believer or you are not the way you are crazy or normal I can neither believe nor want to believe faith a form of madness to which I am not at all subject    The unbeliever s position is quite as impenetrable as the believer s I devote myself to the pleasure of being disappointed this is the very essence of the world above Doubt I rank only the delight which derives from it    And I answer all these pink or chlorotic monks You insist to no purpose I too have gazed upon the heavens but I have seen nothing there Give up trying to convince me if I have sometimes been able to find God by deduction I have never found Him in my heart if I found him there I could not follow you on your path or in your grimaces still less in those ballets which are your masses and complines Nothing surpasses the pleasures of idleness if the end of the world were to come I would not leave my bed at an ungodly hour so how would I go running in the middle of the night to immolate my sleep on the altar of the Uncertain Even if grace beclouded me and ecstasies made me quiver unceasingly a few sarcasms would be enough to distract me Oh no you see I would be afraid to snear in my prayers and thereby to damn myself much more by faith than by incredulity Spare me any further effort in any case my shoulders are too weary to prop heaven    Exercise of Insubmission How I detest Lord the turpitude of Your works and these syrupy ghosts who burn incense to You and resemble You Hating You I have escaped the sugar mills of Your Kingdom the twaddle of Your puppets You are the damper of our flames and our rebellions the fire hose of our fevers the superintendent of our senilities Even before relegating You to a formula I trampled Your arcana scorned Your tricks and all those artifices which produce Your toilette of the Inexplicable You have generously endowed me with the gall Your pity spared Your slaves Since there is no rest but in the shadow of Your nullity the brute finds salvation by just handing himself over to You or Your counterfeits I don t know which is more pitiable Your acolytes or myself we all derive straight from Your incompetence pitch patch hodgepodge syllables of the Creation of Your blundering    Of all that was attempted this side of nothingness is anything more pathetic than this world except for the idea which conceived it Wherever something breathes there is one more infirmity no palpitation which fails to confirm the disadvantage of being the flesh horrifies me these men these women offal that moans by the grace of certain spasms no more relationship with the planet each moment is merely a vote in the urn of my despair What does it matter whether Your works leave off or continue Your subalterns cannot complete what You ventured without genius From the blindness into which You plunged them they will emerge nonetheless but will they have the strength to take revenge and will You to defend yourself This race is rusty and You even rustier Turning toward Your Enemy I await the day when he will pilfer Your sun to hang it in another universe  THE DECOR OF KNOWLEDGE Our truths are worth no more than those of our ancestors Having substituted concepts for their myths and symbols we consider ourselves advanced but these myths and symbols expressed no less than our concepts The Tree of Life the Serpent Eve and Paradise signify as much as Life Knowledge Temptation Unconsciousness The concrete figurations of good and evil in mythology go as far as the Good and Evil of ethics Knowledge if it is profound never changes only its decor varies Love continues without Venus war without Mars and if the gods no longer intervene in events those events are neither more explicable nor less disconcerting the paraphernalia of formulas merely replaces the pomp of the old legends without the constants of human life being thereby modified science apprehending them no more intimately than poetic narratives Modern complacency is limitless we suppose ourselves more enlightened more profound than all the centuries behind us forgetting that the teaching of a Buddha confronted thousands of beings with the problem of nothingness a problem we imagine we have discovered because we have changed its terms and introduced a touch of erudition into it But what Western thinker would survive a comparison with a Buddhist monk We lose ourselves in texts and terminologies meditation is a datum unknown to modern philosophy If we want to keep some intellectual decency enthusiasm for civilization must be banished from our mind as well as the superstition of History As for the great problems we have no advantage over our ancestors or our more recent predecessors men have always known everything at least in what concerns the Essential modern philosophy adds nothing to Chinese Hindu or Greek philosophy Moreover there cannot be a new problem despite our naivete or our infatuation which would like to persuade us to the contrary In the play of ideas who ever equaled a Chinese or a Greek sophist who was ever bolder in abstraction All the extremities of thought were reached from the first and in all civilizations Seduced by the demon of the Unpublished we forget too quickly that we are the epigones of the first pithecanthropus who bothered to reflect Hegel is chiefly responsible for modern optimism How could he have failed to see that consciousness changes only its forms and modalities but never progresses Becoming excludes an absolute fulfillment a goal the temporal adventure unfolds without an aim external to itself and will end when its possibilities of movement are exhausted The degree of consciousness varies with the ages such consciousness not being aggrandized by their succession We are not more conscious than the GrecoRoman world the Renaissance or the eighteenth century each period is perfect in itself and perishable There are privileged moments when consciousness is exasperated but there was never an eclipse of lucidity such that man was incapable of confronting the essential problems history being no more than a perpetual crisis even a breakdown of naivete Negative states precisely those which exasperate consciousness are variously distributed nonetheless they are present in every historical period balanced and happy they know Ennui the natural name for happiness unbalanced and tumultuous they suffer Despair and the religious crises which derive from it The idea of an Earthly Paradise was composed of all the elements incompatible with History with the space in which the negative states flourish All means and methods of knowing are valid reasoning intuition disgust enthusiasm lamentation A vision of the world propped on concepts is no more legitimate than another which proceeds from tears arguments or sighs modalities equally probing and equally vain I construct a form of universe I believe in it and it is the universe which collapses nonetheless under the assault of another certitude or another doubt The merest illiterate and Aristotle are equally irrefutable and fragile The absolute and decrepitude characterize the work ripened for years and the poem dashed off in a moment Is there more truth in The Phenomenology of Mind than in Epipsychidion Lightninglike inspiration as well as laborious investigation offers us definitive results and ridiculous ones Today I prefer this writer to that one tomorrow will come the turn of a work I detested quite recently The creations of the mind and the principles which preside over them follow the fate of our moods of our age of our fevers and our disappointments We call into question everything we once loved and are always right and always wrong for everything is valid and nothing has any importance I smile a world is born I frown it vanishes and another appears No opinion no system no belief fails to be correct and at the same time absurd depending on whether we adhere to it or detach ourselves from it We do not find more rigor in philosophy than in poetry nor in the mind than in the heart rigor exists only so long as we identify ourself with the principle or thing which we confront or endure from outside everything is arbitrary reasons and sentiments What we call truth is an error insufficiently experienced not yet drained but which will soon age a new error and which waits to compromise its novelty Knowledge blooms and withers along with our feelings And if we are in a position to scrutinize all truths it is because we have been exhausted together and because there is no more sap in us than in them History is inconceivable outside of what disappoints Which accounts for the desire to submit ourselves to melancholy and to die of it    True knowledge comes down to vigils in the darkness the sum of our insomnias alone distinguishes us from the animals and from our kind What rich or strange idea was ever the work of a sleeper Is your sleep sound Are your dreams sweet You swell the anonymous crowd Daylight is hostile to thoughts the sun blocks them out they flourish only in the middle of the night    Conclusion of nocturnal knowledge every man who arrives at a reassuring conclusion about anything at all gives evidence of imbecility or false charity Who ever found a single joyous truth which was valid Who saved the honor of the intellect with daylight utterances Happy the man who can say to himself Knowledge turned sour on me History is irony on the move the Mind s jeer down through men and events Today this belief triumphs tomorrow vanquished it will be dismissed and replaced those who accepted it will follow it in its defeat Then comes another generation the old belief is revived its demolished monuments are reconstructed    until they perish yet again No immutable principle rules the favors and severities of fate their succession participates in the huge farce of the Mind which identifies in its play impostors and enthusiasts ardors and devices Consider the polemics of each age they seem neither motivated nor necessary Yet they were the very life of that age Calvinism Quietism PortRoyal the Encyclopedia the Revolution Positivism etc    what a series of absurdities    which tai to be what a futile and yet fatal expense From the ecumenical councils to the controversies of contemporary politics orthodoxies and heresies have assailed the curiosity of mankind with their irresistible nonmeaning Under various disguises there will always be pro and con whether apropos of Heaven or the Bordello Thousands of men will suffer for subtleties relating to the Virgin and the Son thousands of others will torment themselves for dogmas less gratuitous but quite as improbable All truths constitute sects which end by enduring the destiny of a PortRoyal by being persecuted and destroyed then their ruins beloved now and embellished with the halo of the iniquity inflicted upon them will be transformed into a pilgrimagesite    It is no less unreasonable to grant more interest to the arguments around democracy and its forms than to those which took place in the Middle Ages around nominalism and realism each period is intoxicated by an absolute minor and tiresome but in appearance unique we cannot avoid being contemporaries of a faith of a system of an ideology cannot avoid being in short of our time In order to be emancipated from that we would require the coldness of a god of scorn    That History has no meaning is what should delight our hearts Should we be tormenting ourselves for a happy solution to process for a final festival paid for by nothing but our sweat our disasters for future idiots exulting over our labors frolicking on our ashes The vision of a paradisiac conclusion transcends in its absurdity the worst divagations of hope All we can offer in excuse for Time is that in it we find some moments more profitable than others accidents without consequence in an intolerable monotony of perplexities The universe begins and ends with each individual whether he be Shakespeare or Hodge for each individual experiences his merit or his nullity in the absolute    By what artifice did what seems to be escape the control of what is not A moment of inattention of weakness at the heart of Nothingness the grabs took advantage of it a gap in its vigilance and here we are And just as life supplanted nothingness life in its turn was supplanted by history existence thereby committed itself to a cycle of heresies which sapped

confidence Possessing not property projects or even memories I have given over future and philosophy alike owning merely a cot on which to unlearn the sun and sighs I remain stretched out there and spin out the hours around me utensils objects which suggest suicide every one The nail whispers stick me through your heart the trickle of blood need not alarm you The knife insinuates my blade is infallible one second s decision and you have triumphed over misery and shame The window opens of its own accord creaking in the silence you share the city s heights with the poor fling yourself out my overture is a generous one in the wink of an eye you will land on the pavement with the meaning or the meaninglessness of life in your grasp And a rope coils as though around some ideal neck borrowing the tone of a suppliant power I have been waiting for you forever I have watched your terrors your struggles and your rages I have seen your rumpled sheets the pillow where your fury gnawed as I have heard the swearwords with which you gratified the gods Charitable I sympathize and offer my services For you were born to hang yourself like all those who disdain an answer to their doubts or an escape to their despair Underside of an Obsession The notion of nothingness is not characteristic of laboring humanity those who toil have neither time nor inclination to weigh their dust they resign themselves to the difficulties or the doltishness of fate they hope hope is a slave s virtue It is the vain the fatuous and the coquettish who dreading gray hair wrinkles and the death rattle fill their daily vacancy with the image of their own carrion they cherish and despair of themselves their thoughts flutter between the mirror and the graveyard and discover in the jeopardized features of their faces truths as serious as those of religion Every metaphysic begins with an anguish of the body which then becomes universal so that those obsessed by frivolity prefigure authentically tormented minds The superficial idler haunted by the specter of age is closer to Pascal Bossuet or Chateaubriand than a savant quite unconcerned with himself A touch of genius in vanity you have the great proud man who finds death hard to deal with who takes it as a personal offense Buddha himself superior to all the sages was merely fatuous on a divine scale He discovered death his death and wounded renounced everything and imposed his renunciation on others Thus the most terrible and the most futile sufferings are begotten by that crushed pride which in order to face up to Nothingness transforms it out of revenge into Law Epitaph He had the pride never to command or to prescribe anything anyone Without subalterns without masters he neither gave nor received orders Excluded from the empire of laws and somehow anterior to good and evil he never made a living soul suffer The names of things faded from his memory he looked without seeing listened without hearing scents and savors vanished at the approach of his nostrils his palate His senses and his desires were his only slaves hence they felt desired nothing He forgot happiness and misery thirst and fear and if he happened to recall them he scorned to name them and thereby to sink to hope or regret The merest gesture cost him more efforts than it would cost others to establish or overthrow a kingdom Born weary of being born he chose to be a shade when then did he live and by the transgression of what birth And if living he wore his shroud by what miracle did he manage to die Secularization of Tears Only since Beethoven has music addressed itself to men before him it was concerned only with God Bach and the great Italians knew nothing of this descent toward the human this false titanism which has diluted since the Deaf Man the purest art The torsion of the will replaced the suavities the contradiction of the feelings the naive flight frenzy the disciplined sigh heaven having vanished from music man was installed there Where sin had once spread in gentle tears it now displayed itself so that declamation overtook prayer and the romanticism of the Fall triumphed over the harmonious dream of deposition    Bach languor of cosmogony a scale of tears upon which our desires for God ascend architecture of our fragilities positive dissolution the highest of all of our will celestial ruin in Hope the one mode of destroying ourselves without disaster and of disappearing without dying    Is it too late to relearn such dying out Or must we go on faltering without benefit of the organ s chords Fluctuations of the Will Do you know that furnace of the will in which nothing resists your desires where fatality and gravitation lose their empire and vanish before the magic of your power Certain that your gaze would revive the dead that your hand laid upon matter would bring it to life that stones would shudder at your touch that every graveyard would blossom in a smile of immortality you tell yourself From now on there will be nothing but an eternal spring a dance of wonders and the end of all sleep I have brought another fire the gods pale and the creatures rejoice consternation has seized upon the vaults and the din has descended into the very tombs    and the amateur of paroxysms winded falls silent only to resume with the accent of quietism words of abandon Have you ever experienced that somnolence which is transmitted to things that slackness which weakens the sap and suggests a triumphant and eternal autumn Even as I pass all hopes drowse flowers fade the instincts wither everything stops willing everything repents of having willed And each being whispers to me Let someone else have lived my life God or garter snake I sigh for a will to inaction an unreleased infinity an ecstatic atony of the elements a hibernation in broad daylight which would benumb everything from hog to dragonfly    Theory of Goodness Since for you there is no ultimate criterion nor irrevocable principle and no god what keeps you from committing any and every crime I find in myself as much evil as in anyone but detesting action mother of all the vices  am the cause of no one s suffering Harmless without greed and without enough energy or indecency to affront others I leave the world as  found it To take revenge presupposes a constant vigilance and a systematic mind a costly continuity whereas the indifference of forgiveness and contempt renders the hours pleasantly empty All ethics represent a danger for goodness only negligence rescues it Having chosen the phlegm of the imbecile and the apathy of the angel I have excluded myself from actions and since goodness is incompatible with life I have decomposed myself in order to be good Making Allowances It requires a considerable amount of unconsciousness to devote oneself unreservedly to anything Believers lovers disciples perceive only one face of their deities their idols their masters The worshipper remains ineluctably naive Is there a pure feeling which fails to betray the mixture of grace and imbecility a blissful admiration without an eclipse of the intelligence The man who glimpses simultaneously all the aspects of a being or a thing remains forever undecided between impulse and stupor Dissect any belief what pomp of the heart and how much turpitude underneath Infinity dreamed of in the gutter retains ineffaceable its imprint its stench There is a notary in every saint a grocer in every hero a concierge inside the martyr The depth of sighs conceals a grimace sacrifices and devotions are mingled with the vapors of the earthly bordello Consider love is there a nobler outpouring a rapture less suspect Its shudders rival music compete with the tears of solitude and of ecstasy sublime but a sublimity inseparable from the urinary tract transports bordering upon excretion a heaven of the glands sudden sanctity of the orifices    It takes no more than a moment of attention for this intoxication shaken to cast you back into the ordures of physiology or a moment of fatigue to recognize that so much ardor produces only a variety of mucous The waking state in our ravishments alters their flavor and transforms their victim into a visionary trampling ineffable pretexts We cannot love and know at the same time without love suffering and expiring under the mind s gaze Search your admirations scrutinize the beneficiaries of your worship and the profiteers of your abandons under their most disinterested thoughts you will discover selflove the spur of fame the thirst for domination and power All thinkers are action s eunuchs who take revenge for their failure by the intermediary of concepts Born this side of the deed they exalt or decry it depending on whether they aspire to humanity s gratitude or that other form of fame its hatred they unduly erect their own deficiencies their own miseries to the rank of laws their futility to the level of a principle Thought is as much of a lie as love or faith For the truths are frauds and the passions odors and ultimately there is no choice except the one between what lies and what stinks Wonders of Vice Whereas a thinker requires to dissociate himself from the world an enormous labor of interrogations the privilege of a flaw confers from the start a singular destiny Vice bestower of solitude offers the man marked out by it the excellence of a separate condition Consider the invert he inspires two contradictory sentiments disgust and admiration his failure makes him at once inferior and superior to the others he does not accept himself constantly justifies himself invents reasons torn between shame and pride yet enthusiasts of the fatuities of procreation we go with the herd Woe to those who have no sexual secrets How could we divine the fetid advantages of the aberrations Shall we remain forever the progeniture of nature victims of her laws nothing but human trees The individual s deficiencies determine a civilization s flexibility and subtlety Rare sensations are conducive to the mind and its vitality the distracted instinct is located at the antipodes of barbarism Consequently an impotent man is more complex than a brute with undisturbed reflexes and realizes better than anyone the essence of mankind that deserter from zoology and is enriched by all its inadequacies all its impossibilities Suppress vices and flaws take away carnal disorders and you will meet no more souls for what we call by that name is merely a product of inner scandals a designation of mysterious shames an idealization of abjection    In the depths of his naivete the thinker envies the possibilities of knowledge open to whatever is contra naturam he believes not without repulsion in the privileges of monsters     Vice being a suffering and the sole form of celebrity worth the trouble the vicious man has to be deeper than the common run since unspeakably separated from the rest he begins where the others leave off    A natural pleasure taken in what is obvious cancels itself out destroys itself in its own means expires in its actuality whereas an unwonted sensation is a thought out sensation a reflection in the reflexes Vice attains the highest degree of consciousness without the intermediary of philosophy but the thinker requires a whole lifetime to arrive at this affective lucidity by which the pervert begins Yet they resemble one another in their propensity to wrest themselves from the others though the one strives to do so by meditation while the other merely follows the wonders of his inclination The Corrupter Where have the hours gone The memory of a gesture the mark of a passion the luster of a risk a lovely fugitive madness nothing of all that in your past no delirium bears your name no vice honors you You have slipped through without a trace but what was your dream then I should have liked to sow Doubt into the entrails of the globe to imbue its substance with Doubt to enthrone Doubt where the mind never penetrated and before reaching the marrow of mankind to shake the calm of stones to introduce there the insecurity and the anguish of the heart Architect I would have built a temple to Ruin preacher revealed the farce of prayer king hoisted the flag of rebellion As men cherish a secret craving to repudiate themselves I should have provoked selfbetrayal everywhere plunged innocence into stupor multiplied disloyalties kept the multitude from wallowing in the compost heap of certitudes The Architect of the Caves Theology ethics history and everyday experience teach us that to achieve equilibrium there is not an infinity of secrets there is only one submit Accept a yoke these disciplines all repeat and you will be happy be something and you shall be released from your labors Indeed all is task here on earth professionals of time functionaries of respiration dignitaries of hope a job is waiting for us before we are born our careers are prepared in the wombs of our mothers Members of an official universe we have to occupy a place there by the mechanism of a rigid fate which is left vacant only in favor of the mad they at least are not constrained to have a belief to adhere to an institution to sustain an idea to pursue an undertaking Since society was constituted those who sought to withdraw from it were persecuted or mocked You are forgiven everything provided you have a trade a subtitle to your name a seal on your nothingness No one has the audacity to exclaim I don t want to do anything we are more indulgent with a murderer than with a mind emancipated from actions To multiply the possibilities of submission to abdicate his freedom to kill the vagabond in himself thus has man refined his slavery and enfeoffed himself to phantoms Even his scorns and his rebellions have been cultivated only so he can be dominated by them serf that he is of his attitudes his gestures and his moods Having left the caves he has kept their superstition he was their prisoner and has become their architect He perpetuates Ms primal condition with more invention and more subtlety but at bottom dilating or diminishing his caricature he plagiarizes himself brazenly enough A charlatan short of tricks his contortions his grimaces still deceive    Discipline of Atony Like wax in the sun I dissolve by day and solidify at night an alternation which decomposes me and restores me to myself a metamorphosis in inertia and sloth    Was it here that all I have read and learned was to end was this the goal of my vigils Idleness has blunted my enthusiasms slackened my appetites enervated my fury The man who fails to let himself go seems to me a monster I use up my strength in the apprenticeship to abandon and train myself in leisure confronting my whims with the paragraphs of an Art of Putrescence Everywhere people who will    masquerade of steps hurrying toward mean or mysterious goals conflicting wills everyone wills the mob wills thousands bent on something anything    I cannot follow still less defy them I stop stupefied what marvel inspired them with such energy Hallucinating mobility in so little flesh so much vigor and hysteria These bacteria that no scruple can calm that no wisdom can soothe that no gall can disconcert    They brave dangers with more aplomb than any hero unconscious apostles of the effective these saints of the Immediate    gods in the carnivals of time    I turn away and step off the sidewalks of the world    Yet there was a time when I admired the conquerors and the bees when I very nearly hoped but now movement maddens me and energy merely grieves There is more wisdom in letting yourself be carried by the waves than in struggling against them Posthumous to myself I remember Time as a kind of child s play or a lapse of taste Without desires without the hours in which to make them bloom I have only the assurance of having always outlived myself a fetus devoured by an omniscient idiocy even before his eyelids opened and stillborn of lucidity    Supreme Erosion There is something which rivals the most sordid troll something dirty worn defeated and which provokes and at the same time disconcerts fury a peak of exasperation and an article of every moment the word any word and more precisely the one we make use of I say tree house me magnificent stupid I could say anything and I dream of a murderer of all nouns and all adjectives of all these honorable eructations Sometimes it seems to me they are dead and no one wants to bury them Out of cowardice we still consider them to be alive and go on enduring their smell without holding our noses Yet they are not no longer express anything When we think of all the mouths they pass through all the breaths they corrupt all the occasions on which they were offered can we still employ a single one without being polluted They are tossed to us prechewed yet we would not dream of swallowing food already masticated by others the material action which corresponds to the use of words turns our stomach yet all it takes is a moment s irritation to realize under any word an aftertaste of someone else s saliva To refresh language humanity would have to stop talking it would resort profitably to signs or more effectively to silence Prostitution of the word is the most visible symptom of its degradation there is no utterance intact no pure articulation and down to the very things signified everything is corrupted by repetitions Why would each generation not learn a new idiom if only to give a new vigor to objects How love and hate struggle and suffer with these anemic symbols Life death metaphysical stereotypes exhausted enigmas    Man should create another illusion of reality and invent to this end other words since his own lack blood and at their stage of agony there is no transfusion possible At the Obsequies of Desire A tiny cave yawns in each cell    We know where diseases set in their site the specific weakness of the organs but this unspecifiable ill    this oppression under the weight of a thousand oceans this desire for an ideally baleful poison    The vulgarities of renewal the provocations of the sun of foliage of sap    My blood disintegrates when the buds open when the bird and the beast frolic    I envy the mad the sleeping dormouse the bear s winters the sage s dryness I would exchange for their torpor my agitation the frenzy of a vague murderer who dreams of crimes this side of blood And more than them all how much I envy those emperors of the decadence sullen and cruel who were stabbed at the height of their criminal course I give myself up to space like a blind man s tears Whose will am  who wills in me I wish some demon would conceive a conspiracy against man I would join it Tired of participating in the obsequies of my desires I should at last have an ideal excuse for Ennui is the martyrdom of those who live and die for no belief Irrefutable Disappointment Everything confirms it feeds it it crowns knowing unimpeachable events feelings thoughts no moment which fails to consecrate it no impulse which fails to empower it no reflection which fails to reinforce it Divinity whose kingdom is limitless more powerful than the fatality which serves and illustrates it hyphen between life and death it unites identifies and feeds on them both Beside its arguments and verifications the sciences themselves seem a jumble of whims Nothing can diminish the fervor of its distastes what truths flourishing in a spring of axioms could defy its visionary dogmatism its proud insanity No heat of youth nor even the mind s derangement resists its certitudes and its victories are proclaimed with one and the same voice by wisdom and by madness Before its seamless empire before its limitless sovereignty our knees bend everything begins in ignorance of it everything ends by yielding to it no action evades it none fails to be led back to it The last word here on earth it alone does not disappoint   In the Secret of Moralists When we have stuffed the universe with melancholy all we have left to light up the mind with is joy impossible rare flashing joy and it is when we no longer hope that we suffer the fascination of hope Life a gift given to the living by those obsessed with death    Since the direction of our thoughts is not that of our hearts we sustain a secret inclination for all that we trample down Say a man registers the creaking of the world s machinery it is because he has dreamed too much of the resonance of the Spheres failing to hear them he abases himself to hear only the din around him Bitter words emanate from a wounded sensibility from an offended delicacy The venom of a La Rochefoucauld a Chamfort was the revenge they took on a world designed for brutes All gall conceals a revenge and is translated into a system pessimism that cruelty of the conquered who cannot forgive life for having deceived their expectations The gaiety which strikes mortal blows   the pleasantry which conceals the dagger under a smile   I think of certain ironies of Voltaire certain retorts of Rivarol the stinging words of Mme du Deffand the jeers which show through so much elegance the aggressive frivolity of the salons the sallies which entertain and slaughter the bitterness contained in an excess of civility    And I think of an ideal moralist a combination of cynicism and lyric ardor exalted and icy vague and incisive as close to Rousseau s Reveries as to Lacios Liaisons or uniting in himself Vauvenargues and Sade tact and torment    Observer of mores in himself having no need to seek elsewhere the least attention on home grounds would show him the contradictions of life all of whose aspects he would reflect so well that ashamed of duplication it would disappear    No attention whose exercise fails to lead to an act of annihilation this is the fatality of observation with all the disadvantages which derive from it for the observer from the classical moralist down to Proust Everything dissolves under the searching eye passions long attachments ardors are the characteristic of simple minds faithful to others and to themselves A touch of lucidity in the heart makes it the seat of feigned feelings and turns the lover into Adolphe and the discontent into Rene Loving we do not examine love acting we do not meditate upon action if I study my neighbor it is because he has ceased to be my neighbor and I am no longer myself if I analyze myself I become an object along with all the rest The believer who weighs his faith ends by putting God in the scales and safeguards his fervor only out of fear of losing it Placed at the antipodes of naivete of integral and authentic existence the moralist exhausts himself in a visavis with himself and with others comedian microcosm of second thoughts he does not endure the artifice which men in order to live spontaneously accept and incorporate in their nature Everything seems convention he divulges the motives of feelings and actions he unmasks the simulacra of civilization because he suffers at having glimpsed and gone beyond them for these simulacra give life they are life whereas his existence in contemplating them strays into the search for a nature which does not exist and which if it did would be as alien to him as the artifices which have been added to it All psychological complexity reduced to its elements explained and dissected involves an operation much deadlier to the operator than to the victim We liquidate our feelings by pursuing their detours and our impulses if we ambush their trajectory and when we detail the movements of others it is not they who lose their way    Everything we do not participate in seems unreasonable but those who move cannot fail to advance whereas the observer whichever way he turns registers their futile triumph only to excuse his own defeat This is because there is life only in the inattention to life Monastic Fantasy Those days when women took the veil to conceal from the world and as if from themselves the advances of age the diminution of their beauty the fading of their charms    when men weary of fame and ceremony left the Court to take refuge in devotion    The fashion of conversion for discretion s sake vanished with the seventeenth century Pascal s shadow and Jacqueline s shade fell like invisible glamors over the merest courtesan over the most frivolous beauty But PortRoyal has been destroyed forever and with it the places favorable to discreet and solitary agonies No more coquetry of the convent where now to look in order to soften our degradations for a context at once dim and sumptuous An Epicurean like SaintEvremond imagined one to his liking and as comforting and lax as his own savoirvivre In those days one still had to take God into account adjust Him to disbelief include Him in solitude A transaction crammed with charm irremediably vanished We lack cloisters as dispossessed as vacant as our souls in order to lose ourselves there without the attendance of the heavens and in a purity of absent ideals cloisters befitting the disabused angels who in their fall by dint of vanquished illusions would remain still immaculate We long for a vogue of retreats in an eternity without faith an assumption of the habit in nothingness an Order released from mysteries and from which no brother would claim anything disdaining his salvation even as that of others an Order of Impossible Salvation    In Honor of Madness    Better I were distract So should my thoughts he severd front my griefs King Lear The exclamation is wrung from Gloucester by Lear s madness    In order to separate ourselves from our griefs our last resort is delirium subject to its distractions we no longer meet our afflictions parallel to our pains and adjacent to our melancholies we divagate in a salutary darkness When we curse that itch called life and when we are weary of the scabs of duration the lunatic s assurance amid his tribulations becomes a temptation and a model let some kind fate rid us of our reason No escape so long as the intellect remains attentive to the heart s impulses so long as it does not break the habit I aspire to the idiot s nights to his mineral sufferings to the bliss of groaning with indifference as if they were someone else s groans to the calvary in which we are strangers to ourselves in which our own cries come from elsewhere to an anonymous hell where we dance and jeer as we destroy ourselves To live and die in the third person   to be exiled in myself to dissociate myself from my name forever distracted from the man I was   to attain at last since life is endurable only at this price the wisdom of dementia    My Heroes When we are young we look for heroes I have had mine Kleist Karoline von Gunderode Nerval Otto Weininger    Intoxicated by their suicides I was certain that they alone had gone to the end that they drew in death the right conclusion from their thwarted or fulfilled loves from their broken minds or philosophic pain That a man should survive his passion was enough to make him contemptible or abject in my eyes which is to say that humanity was superfluous I discovered in it an infinitesimal number of lofty resolutions and so much compromise with life that I turned away from it determined to put an end to it all before I was thirty But as the years went by I lost the pride of youth each day like a lesson in humility I reminded myself that I was still alive that I was betraying my dreams among men rotten with    life Exasperated by the expectation of no longer existing I considered it a duty to cleave my flesh when dawn broke after a night of love and that it was a nameless degradation to sully by memory an excess of sighs Or at other moments how was one to insult duration further when one had grasped everything in a dilation which enthrones pride in the very heavens I thought that the only action a man could perform without shame was to take his life that he had no right to diminish himself in the succession of days and the inertia of misery No elect I kept telling myself but those who committed suicide Even now I have more esteem for a concierge who hangs himself than for a living poet Man is provisionally exempt from suicide that is his one glory his one excuse But he is not aware of it and calls cowardice the courage of those who dared to raise themselves by death above themselves We are bound together by a tacit pact to go on to the last breath this pact which cements our solidarity dooms us nonetheless our entire race is stricken by its infamy Without suicide no salvation Strange that death though eternal has not become part of our behavior sole reality it cannot become a vogue Thus as living men we are all retarded    The SimpleMinded Consider the accent with which a man utters the word truth the inflection of assurance or reserve he uses the expression of believing or doubting it and you will be edified as to the nature of his opinions and the quality of his mind No word is emptier yet men make an idol of it and convert its nonmeaning at once into a criterion and a goal of thought This superstition which excuses the vulgarian and disqualifies the philosopher results from the encroachment of hope upon logic You are told over and over truth is inaccessible yet it must be searched for aspired to fought over Behold a restriction which fails to separate you from those who declare they have found it the main thing is to believe it is possible to possess truth or to aspire to it are two actions which proceed from one and the same attitude We make an exception of one word as of another terrible usurpation of language I call simpleminded any man who speaks of Truth with conviction it is because he has capital letters in reserve and employs them naively without deception without disdain As for the philosopher his slightest indulgence in this idolatry exposes him the citizen in him has won out over the solitary Hope emerging from a thought that saddens us or makes us smile    There is an indecency about putting too much soul in such words the childishness of any enthusiasm for knowledge    And it is time that philosophy casting discredit upon Truth freed itself from all capital letters Poverty Mental Stimulant To keep the mind vigilant there is only coffee disease insomnia or the obsession of death poverty contributes to this condition in equal measure if not more effectively terror of tomorrow as much as that of eternity money troubles as much as metaphysical fears exclude repose and oblivion All our humiliations come from the fact that we cannot bring ourselves to die of hunger We pay dearly for this cowardice To be dependent on men without the vocation of beggars To abase ourselves before these dressedup lucky infatuated marmosets To be at the mercy of these caricatures unworthy of contempt It is the shame of seeking anything which excites the desire to annihilate this planet with its hierarchies and the degradations they involve Society is not a disease it is a disaster what a stupid miracle that one can live in it When we contemplate it between rage and indifference it becomes inexplicable that no one has been able to demolish its structure that hitherto there have not been minds desperate and decent enough to raze it to the ground without a trace There is more than one resemblance between begging for a coin in the city and waiting for an answer from the silence of the universe Avarice presides over men s hearts and over matter Away with this stingy existence It hoards money and mysteries purses are as inaccessible as the depths of the Unknown But maybe someday that Unknown will reveal itself and open its treasuries never so long as there is blood in his veins will the Rich Man unearth his wealth    He will confess his shames his vices his crimes he will lie about his fortune he will make you every confidence hand you his life you will not share his last secret his pecuniary secret    Poverty is not a transitory state it coincides with the certainty that whatever happens you will never have anything that you are born on the wrong side of the circuit of goods that you must struggle for even a breath and conquer air itself and hope and sleep and that even when society disappears nature will be no less inclement no less perverted No paternal principle watched over the Creation everywhere buried treasures behold the Miser as demiurge the God on high a sly skinflint It is He who implanted in you the terror of tomorrow it is scarcely surprising that religion itself should be a form of this terror For the paupers of eternity poverty is a kind of stimulant they have taken once and for all without the possibility of an antidote or a kind of innate awareness which before any knowledge of life could describe its inferno    Invocation to Insomnia I was seventeen and I believed in philosophy What did not relate to philosophy seemed to me either a sin or slops poets jugglers good for the amusement of trivial women action imbecility in delirium love death low excuses rejecting the honor of concepts Foul odors of a universe unworthy of the mind s perfume    The concrete what an abomination Delight or suffering what shames Only abstraction seemed to palpitate with life I gave myself up to ancillary exploits lest some nobler object might make me infringe my principles and submit to the degradations of the heart I told myself over and over only the brothel is compatible with metaphysics and I coveted to escape poetry the eyes of housemaids the sighs of whores    when you came Insomnia to shake my flesh and my pride you who transform the childish brute give nuance to the instincts focus to dreams you who in a single night grant more knowledge than days spent in repose and to reddened eyelids reveal yourself a more important event than the nameless diseases or the disasters of time You made me hear the snore of health human beings plunged into sonorous oblivion while my solitude engrossed the surrounding dark and became huger than the night Everything slept slept forever There was no dawn I shall lie awake this way until the end of time they will wait for me then to ask me to account for the blank space of my dreams    Each night was like the others each night was eternal And I felt one with all those who cannot sleep with all those unknown brothers Like the corrupt and the fanatical I had a secret like them I belonged to a clan to which everything could be excused given sacrificed the clan of the sleepless I granted genius to the firstcomer whose eyelids were heavy with fatigue and admired no mind that could sleep were it the glory of the State of Art or of Letters I would have worshipped a tyrant who to take revenge on his nights would have forbidden rest punished oblivion prescribed disaster and fevers And it was then that I appealed to philosophy but there is no idea which comforts in the dark no system which resists those vigils The analyses of insomnia undo all certainties Weary of such destruction I came to the point of telling myself no more vacillation sleep or die    reconquer sleep or disappear    But this reconquest is no easy matter when you come close to it you realize how deeply you have been marked by the nights You love    your impulses will be forever corrupted you will emerge from each ecstasy like a scarecrow of pleasure you will confront the glances of your too immediate companion with a criminal countenance you will answer her sincere gestures with the irritations of an envenomed pleasure her innocence with a guilty poetry for everything for you will become poetry but a poetry of transgression    Crystalline ideas happy sequence of thoughts You will not think any more it will be an explosion a lava of concepts without consequence and without order a vomit of aggressive concepts spewed from your guts punishments the flesh inflicts upon itself the mind being a victim of the humors and out of the question    You will suffer from everything and to excess the winds will seem gales every touch a dagger smiles slaps trifles cataclysms Waking may come to an end but its light survives within you one does not see in the dark with impunity one does not gather its lessons without danger there are eyes which can no longer learn anything from the sun and souls afflicted by nights from which they will never recover    Profile of the Wicked Man What is responsible for his not having done more evil than he might or must for his not committing murder wreaking subtler vengeances for not having obeyed the injunctions of the blood rushing to his head His moods his education Certainly not and still less a native goodness but merely the presence of the idea of death Inclined to forgive no one anything he pardons all the slightest insult arouses his instincts he forgets it the next moment Enough for him to imagine his own corpse and to apply this method to others in order to be suddenly soothed the figure of what decomposes makes him good and cowardly no wisdom nor charity without macabre obsessions The healthy man proud of existing takes his revenge listens to his blood and his nerves heeds his prejudices answers blow for blow and kills But the mind undermined by the fear of death no longer reacts to external solicitations it sketches out actions and leaves them unfinished reflects upon honor and loses it    tries out passions and dissects them    This dread which accompanies its gestures enervates their vigor its desires expire before the vision of universal insignificance Filled with hatred by necessity unable to be so by conviction the plots and crimes of such a man are halted in midcourse like all men he conceals a murderer inside himself but a murderer imbued with resignation and too weary to crush his enemies or to create new ones He dreams forehead on his dagger and as though disappointed before they happen by every crime considered a good man by everyone he would be wicked if he did not find it futile to be so Views on Tolerance Signs of life cruelty fanaticism intolerance sighs of decadence amenity understanding indulgence   So long as an institution is based on strong instincts it admits neither enemies nor heretics it massacres burns or imprisons them Stakes scaffolds prisons it is not wickedness which invented them but conviction any utter conviction Once a belief is established the police will guarantee its truth sooner or later Jesus once he wanted to triumph among men should have been able to foresee Torquemada ineluctable consequence of Christianity translated into history And if the Lamb failed to anticipate the torturer of the Cross his future defender then he deserves his nickname By the Inquisition the Church proved that it still possessed enormous vitality similarly the kings by their royal will All authorities have their Bastille the more powerful an institution the less humane The energy of a period is measured by the beings that suffer in it and it is by the victims it provokes that a religious or political belief is affirmed bestiality being the primal characteristic of any success in time Heads fall where an idea prevails it can prevail only at the expense of other ideas and of the heads which conceived or defended them History confirms skepticism yet it is and lives only by trampling over it no event rises out of doubt but all considerations of events lead to it and justify it Which is to say that tolerance supreme good on earth is at the same time the supreme evil To admit all points of view the most disparate beliefs the most contradictory opinions presupposes a general state of lassitude and sterility Whence we arrive at this miracle the adversaries coexist but precisely because they can no longer be adversaries opposing doctrines recognize each other s merits because none has the vigor to assert itself A religion dies when it tolerates truths which exclude it and the god in whose name one no longer kills is dead indeed An absolute perishes a vague glow of earthly paradise appears a fugitive gleam for intolerance constitutes the law of human affairs Collectivities are reinforced only under tyrannies and disintegrate in a regime of clemency then in a burst of energy they begin to strangle their liberties and to worship their jailers crowned or commoners The periods of fear predominate over those of calm man is much more vexed by the absence than by the profusion of events thus History is the bloody product of his rejection of boredom Sartorial Philosophy With what tenderness and what jealousy my thoughts turn toward the desert fathers and toward the cynics The abjection of owning the merest object this table this bed these rags    Clothes get between us and nothingness Look at your body in a mirror you will realize that you are mortal run your fingers over your ribs as though across a guitar and you will see how close you are to the grave It is because we are dressed that we entertain immortality how can we die when we wear a necktie The corpse that decks itself out fails to recognize itself and imagining eternity appropriates that illusion Flesh covers the skeleton clothes cover the flesh subterfuge of nature and of man instinctive and conventional deceptions a gentleman cannot be kneaded of clay and dust    Dignity decency so many escapes in the face of the irremediable And when you put on a hat who would say that you have sojourned among entrails or that the worms will gorge on your fat    This is why I shall abandon these rags and casting away the mask of my days flee the time when in collusion with the others I strive to betray myself There was a time when solitaries stripped themselves of everything in order to identify with themselves in the desert or in the street delighting in their nakedness they attained to the supreme fortune they were the equals of the dead    Among the Dregs To console myself for the remorse of sloth I take the path to the lower depths impatient to degrade myself and identify with the gutter I know these grandiloquent stinking sneering bums engulfed in their filth I take my pleasure in their fetid breath no less than in their verve Pitiless for those who succeed their genius for doing nothing compels admiration though the spectacle they afford is the saddest in the world poets without talent whores without clients businessmen without a penny lovers without glands inferno of women no one wants    Behold then I tell myself man s negative fulfillment behold laid bare this being who pretends to a divine lineage pathetic counterfeiter of the absolute    Here is where he was to end in this spitting image of himself mud God never laid a hand on beast no angel has a part in infinity begotten in moans soul risen out of a spasm   I contemplate that dim despair of spermatozoa that have reached their end these funeral countenances of the race I am reassured I have a way to go still    Then I am frightened shall I too fall so low And I hate that toothless crone this rhymer without verses these impotents of love and affairs these models of the dishonor of the mind and the flesh    The man s eyes overwhelm me I wanted to reap on contact with these wrecks a harvest of pride I take away a shudder like the one a living man would experience who to delight in not being dead pilfered a coffin    On an Entrepreneur of Ideas He tries everything and for him everything succeeds nothing of which he is not the contemporary So much vigor in the artifices of the intellect so much readiness to confront all the realms of the mind and of fashion from metaphysics to movies dazzles must dazzle No problem resists him no phenomenon is foreign to him no temptation leaves him indifferent He is a conqueror and has but one secret his lack of emotion nothing keeps him from dealing with anything since he does so with no accent of his own His constructions are magnificent but without salt categories swell with intimate experiences classified as in a file of disasters or a catalogue of anxieties Here are ranged the tribulations of man as well as the poetry of his laceration The Irremediable has turned into a system even a side show displayed like an article of common commerce a true mass product of anguish The public delights in it the nihilism of the boulevard and the bitterness of the cafe feed on it Thinker without fate infinitely empty and marvelously ample he exploits his thought wants it to be on every mouth No destiny pursues him born in the age of materialism he would have followed its facility and given it an unimaginable extension out of romanticism he would have constituted a Summa of reveries appearing in the world of theology he would have wielded God like any other concept His skill in confronting the great problems is disconcerting everything is remarkable except authenticity Basically nonpoet if he speaks of nothingness he lacks its shudder his disgusts are pondered his exasperations controlled and invented after the fact but his will supernaturally effective is at the same time so lucid that he could be a poet if he wanted to and I should add a saint if he insisted    Having neither preferences nor oppositions his opinions are accidents one regrets that he believes in them only the movement the method of his thought is of interest Were I to hear Mm preach from the pulpit I would not be surprised so true is it that he locates himself beyond all truths masters them so that none is necessary or organic to him    Advancing like an explorer he conquers realm after realm his steps no less than his thoughts are enterprises his brain is not the enemy of his instincts he rises above the rest having suffered neither fatigue nor that vehement mortification which paralyzes desire Son of a period he expresses its contradictions its futile dilation and when he flung himself forward in its conquest he employed so much pertinacity and stubbornness that his success and his renown equal those of the sword and rehabilitate the mind by means which hitherto were hateful or unknown to it Truths of Temperament Confronting thinkers without pathos character and intensity who model themselves on the forms of their time appear others of whom we feel that appearing whenever they would have been the same themselves unconcerned by their age drawing their thoughts from their own depths from the specific eternity of their flaws They take from their environment only the surface a few peculiarities of style a few characteristic turns of a given development In love with their fate they suggest explosions tragic and solitary figurations something between apocalypse and psychiatry A Kierkegaard a Nietzsche had they appeared in the most anodyne age would have had no less tremulous no less incendiary an inspiration They perished in their flames a few centuries earlier they would have perished in those of the stake visavis general truths they were predestined to heresy It matters little that one be engulfed in one s own fire or in that kindled for you the truths of temperament must be paid for in one way or another The viscera the blood the miseries and the vices converge to beget them Impregnated with subjectivity we perceive a self behind each of them everything becomes confession a shriek of the flesh is at the source of the most banal utterance even a theory of impersonal appearance serves only to betray its author his secrets his sufferings no universality which is not his mask even logic everything is an excuse for his autobiography his self has infested ideas his anguish has been converted into a criterion into the sole reality Flayed Alive What life is left him robs him of what reason is left him Trifles or scourges the passing of a fly or the cramps of the planet horrify him equally With his nerves on fire he would like the earth to be made of glass to shatter it to smithereens and with what thirst he would fling himself toward the stars to reduce them to powder one by one    Crime glistens in his eyeballs his hands tighten in vain to strangle Life is transmitted like a leprosy too many creatures for a single murderer It is in the nature of the man who cannot kill himself to seek revenge against whatever enjoys existing And failing he mopes like a damned soul infuriated by impossible destructions A discarded Satan he weeps pounds his breast bows his head the blood he wanted to shed fails to redden his own cheeks whose pallor reflects his disgust with that secretion of hopes produced by the advancing species His great dream was to destroy the days of Creation   he renounces his dream collapses into himself and yields to the elegy of his own failure another order of excess is the result His skin burns fever fills the universe his brain is on fire the air is inflammable His ills fill sidereal space his griefs make the poles tremble And whatever is allusion to existence the most imperceptible breath of life wrings from him a cry which compromises the music of the spheres and the movement of the stars Incompatibilities A mind compels us only by its incompatibilities by the tension of its movements by the divorce of its opinions from its inclinations Marcus Aurelius engaged on remote expeditions tends more toward the idea of death than toward that of the Empire Julian made emperor regrets his contemplative life envies the sages and wastes his nights polemicizing against the Christians Luther with a vandal s vitality sinks and mopes in the obsession of sin and without finding an equilibrium between his delicacies and his crudities Rousseau who mistakes his instincts lives only in the idea of his sincerity Nietzsche whose entire oeuvre is nothing but a hymn to power drags out a sickly existence of a poignant monotony    For a mind matters only to the degree that it deceives itself as to what it wants what it loves or what it hates being several it cannot choose itself A pessimism without raptures an agitator of hopes without bitterness deserves only scorn Only the man who has no regard for his past for propriety logic or consideration is worthy of our attachment how can we love a conqueror if he fails to plunge into events with a suspicion of failure or a thinker if he has not conquered his instinct for selfpreservation Man fallen back on his futility is no longer concerned with the desire to have a life   If he were to have one or were not would concern the others    Apostle of his fluctuations he no longer encumbers himself with an ideal identity his temperament constitutes his sole doctrine and the whim of the moment his sole knowledge Restoration of a Cult Having eroded my quality as a man nothing is any longer of any value Everywhere all I see are animals with an ideal that herd together to bleat their hopes    Even those who did not live together are constrained to do so like ghosts or else to what end have we conceived the communion of saints In pursuit of a true solitary I scrutinize the ages and I find there and envy there only the Devil    Reason banishes him the heart craves him    Spirit of lies Prince of darkness the Evil One the Enemy how sweet it is to murmur the names that flayed his solitude And how I cherish him since his daily relegation If only I could reestablish him in his primal state I believe in him with all my incapacity to believe His company is necessary to me a lonely being tends toward the loneliest being toward the One    I owe it to myself to tend toward him my power to admire fearing to remain unemployed compels me to it Behold me confronting my model attaching myself to him I punish my solitude for not being total I forge out of it another which transcends it it is my way of being humble    We replace God as best we can for every god is good provided he perpetuates in eternity our desire for a crucial solitude    We Troglodytes Values do not accumulate a generation contributes something new only by trampling on what was unique in the preceding generation This is even more the case in the succession of centuries the Renaissance could not save the depth the phantoms the genre of savagery of the Middle Ages the Enlightenment in its turn preserved only the sense of the universal from the Renaissance without the pathos which marked its physiognomy The modern illusion has plunged man into the swoons of becoming he has lost his footing in eternity his substance Every conquest spiritual or political implies a loss every conquest is an affirmation    but a murderous one In the realm of art the only one in which we can speak of the life of the mind an ideal is established only on the ruins of its predecessor each true artist is a traitor to his forebears    There is no superiority in history republicmonarchy romanticismclassicism liberalismautocracy naturalismabstraction irrationalismintellectualism institutions like currents of thought and feeling are of equal worth No form of mind can assume another we are something only by exclusion no one can reconcile order and disorder abstraction and immediacy impulse and fatality The periods of synthesis are not creative they summarize the fervor of the others a confused chaotic resume every eclecticism being an indication of an ending Every step forward is followed by a step back this is the unfruitful oscillation of history a stationary    becoming That man should have let himself be duped by the mirage of Progress is what renders his claims to subtlety absurd Progress Perhaps we can find it in hygiene    But anywhere else In scientific discoveries After all no more than deadly glories    Who in good faith could choose between the stone age and the age of modern weapons As close to the ape in one as in the other we scale the clouds for the same reasons we shinnied up trees the means of our curiosity pure or criminal are all that have changed and with disguised reflexes we are more diversely rapacious A mere whim to accept or reject a period we must accept or reject history en bloc The notion of progress makes us all dolts on the pinnacles of time but these pinnacles do not exist the troglodyte who trembled with fear in the caves still trembles in the skyscrapers Our capital of misery remains intact down through the ages yet we have one advantage over our ancestors that of having invested our capital better since our disaster is better organized Physiognomy of a Failure Monstrous dreams inhabit groceries and churches I have come across no one who did not live in delirium Since the merest desire conceals a source of insanity it is enough to conform to the instinct of selfpreservation to deserve the asylum Life a fit of lunacy throttling matter   I breathe enough to be put away    Incapable of attaining to the lucidities of death I crawl in the shadow of the days and I yet am only by the will no longer to be    Once I thought I could crush space with a blow of my fist play with the stars halt time or wield it according to my whim The great captains seemed to me the great cowards the poets wretched stammerers not knowing the resistance things men and words offer us and supposing I felt more than the universe allowed I gave myself up to a suspect infinity to a cosmogony resulting from a puberty unfit to end itself    How easy it is to believe yourself a god by the heart and how hard it is to be one by the mind And with how many illusions must I have been born in order to be able to lose one every day Life is a miracle bitterness destroys The interval separating me from my corpse is a wound yet I aspire in vain to the seductions of the grave unable to rid myself of anything to cease breathing either everything in me suggests that the worms will be out of work when they get to my instincts As incompetent in life as in death I loathe myself and in this loathing I dream of another life another death And for having sought to be a sage such as never was I am only a madman among the mad    Procession of SubMen Committed beyond his means beyond his instincts man has ended up in an impasse He has burned his bridges    to catch up with his conclusion animal without a future he has foundered in his ideal he has worsted himself at his own game Having ceaselessly sought to transcend himself he is paralyzed and his only remaining resource is to recapitulate his follies to expiate them and to commit a few more    Yet there are some to whom even this resource remains forbidden Unaccustomed to being men they murmur do we still belong to a tribe a race a breed So long as we had the prejudice of life we espoused an error which kept us on a footing with the others    But we have escaped the race    Our lucidity crumbling our skeleton has reduced us to a limp existence invertebrate rabble stretching out on matter to corrupt it with slobber Behold us among the slime behold us at that laughable end where we pay for having misused our faculties and our dreams    Life was not our lot at the very moments when we were drunk with life all our joys came from our transports above it taking revenge life lugs us toward its lower depths procession of submen toward a sublife   Quousque Eadem Forever be accursed the star under which I was born may no sky protect it let it crumble in space like a dust without honor And let the traitorous moment that cast me among the creatures be forever erased from the lists of Time My desires can no longer deal with this mixture of life and death in which eternity daily rots Weary of the future I have traversed its days and yet I am tormented by the intemperance of unknown thirsts Like a frenzied sage dead to the world and frantic against it I invalidate my illusions only to irritate them the more This exasperation in an unforeseeable universe where nonetheless everything repeats itself will it never come to an end How long must I keep telling myself I loathe this life I idolize The nullity of our deliriums makes us all so many gods subject to an insipid fatality Why rebel any longer against the symmetry of this world when Chaos itself can only be a system of disorders Our fate being to rot with the continents and the stars we drag on like resigned sick men and to the end of time the curiosity of a denouement that is foreseen frightful and vain Three in the morning I realize this second then this one then the next I draw up the balance sheet for each minute And why all this Because I was born It is a special type of sleeplessness that produces the indictment of birth Ever since I was born that since has a resonance so dreadful to my ears it becomes unendurable There is a kind of knowledge that strips whatever you do of weight and scope for such knowledge everything is without basis except itself Pure to the point of abhorring even the notion of an object it translates that extreme science according to which doing or not doing something comes down to the same thing and is accompanied by an equally extreme satisfaction that of being able to rehearse each time the discovery that any gesture performed is not worth defending that nothing is enhanced by the merest vestige of substance that reality falls within the province of lunacy Such knowledge deserves to be called posthumous it functions as if the knower were alive and not alive a being and the memory of a being It s already in the past he says about all he achieves even as he achieves it thereby forever destitute of the present Unmaking decreating is the only task man may take upon himself if he aspires as everything suggests to distinguish himself from the Creator I know that my birth is fortuitous a laughable accident and yet as soon as I forget myself I behave as if it were a capital event indispensable to the progress and equilibrium of the world To have committed every crime but that of being a father As a general rule men expect disappointment they know they must not be impatient that it will come sooner or later that it will hold off long enough for them to proceed with their undertakings of the moment The disabused man is different for him disappointment occurs at the same time as the deed he has no need to await it it is present By freeing himself from succession he has devoured the possible and rendered the future superfluous I cannot meet you in your future he says to the others We do not have a single moment in common Because for him the whole of the future is already here When we perceive the end in the beginning we move faster than time Illumination that lightning disappointment affords a certitude which transforms disillusion into deliverance I disentangle myself from appearances yet I am snarled in them nonetheless or rather I am halfway between these appearances and that which invalidates them that which has neither name nor content that which is nothing and everything I shall never take the decisive step outside them my nature forces me to drift to remain forever in the equivocal and if I were to attempt a clean break in one direction or the other I should perish by my salvation My faculty for disappointment surpasses understanding It is what lets me comprehend Buddha but also what keeps me from following him What we can no longer commiserate with counts for nothing no longer exists We realize why our past so quickly stops being ours and turns into history something which no longer concerns anyone In the deepest part of yourself aspire to be as dispossessed as lamentable as God True contact between beings is established only by mute presence by apparent noncommunication by that mysterious and wordless exchange which resembles inward prayer What I know at sixty I knew as well at twenty Forty years of a long a superfluous labor of verification I am for the most part so convinced that everything is lacking in basis consequence justification that if someone dared to contradict me even the man I most admire he would seem to me a charlatan or a fool Even in childhood I watched the hours flow independent of any reference any action any event the disjunction of time from what was not itself its autonomous existence its special status its empire its tyranny I remember quite clearly that afternoon when for the first time confronting the empty universe I was no more than a passage of moments reluctant to go on playing their proper parts Time was coming unstuck from being at my expense Unlike Job I have not cursed the day I was born all the other days on the contrary I have covered with my anathemas  If death had only negative aspects dying would be an unmanageable action Everything exists nothing exists Either formula affords a like serenity The man of anxiety to his misfortune remains between them trembling and perplexed forever at the mercy of a nuance incapable of gaining a foothold in the security of being or in the absence of being Here on the coast of Normandy at this hour of the morning I needed no one The very gulls presence bothered me I drove them off with stones And hearing their supernatural shrieks I realized that that was just what I wanted that only the Sinister could soothe me and that it was for such a confrontation that I had got up before dawn In this our life to be in life suddenly I am struck by the strangeness of such an expression as if it applied to no one Whenever I flag and feel sorry for my brain I am carried away by an irresistible desire to proclaim That is the moment I realize the paltry depths out of which rise reformers prophets and saviors I long to be free desperately free Free as the stillborn are free If there is so much discomfort and ambiguity in lucidity it is because lucidity is the result of the poor use to which we have put our sleepless nights Our obsession with birth by shifting us to a point before our past robs us of our pleasure in the future in the present and even in the past Rare are the days when projected into posthistory I fail to witness the gods hilarity at leaving behind the human episode What we need is an alternate vision when that of the Last Judgment no longer satisfies anyone An idea a being anything which becomes incarnate loses identity turns grotesque Frustration of all achievement Never quit the possible wallow in eternal trifling forget to be born The real the unique misfortune to see the light of day A disaster which dates back to aggressiveness to the seed of expansion and rage within origins to the tendency to the worst which first shook them up When we see someone again after many years we should sit down facing each other and say nothing for hours so that by means of silence our consternation can relish itself Days of miraculous sterility Instead of rejoicing over them proclaiming victory transforming this drought into a celebration seeing it as an illustration of my fulfillment my maturity in short my detachment I let myself be invaded by spite and resentment so tenacious is the old Adam in us the bustling canaille unfit for selfeffacement I am enraptured by Hindu philosophy whose essential endeavor is to surmount the self and everything I do everything I think is only myself and the selfs humiliations While we are performing an action we have a goal performed the action has no more reality for us than the goal we were seeking Nothing of much consequence here no more than a game But some of us are conscious of this game in the course of the action we experience the conclusion in the premises the achieved in the virtual we undermine seriousness by the very fact that we exist The vision of nonreality of universal default is the product of an everyday sensation and a sudden frisson Everything is a game without such a revelation the sensation we haul through our usual lives would not have that characteristic stamp our metaphysical experiences require to be distinguished from their imitations our discomforts For every discomfort is only an abortive metaphysical experience When we have worn out the interest we once took in death when we realize we have nothing more to gain from it we fall back on birth we turn to a much more inexhaustible abyss At this very moment I am suffering as we say in French j ai mal This event crucial for me is nonexistent even inconceivable for anyone else for everyone else Except for God if that word can have a meaning would grow develop gather force Hence we see why by taking a contrary trajectory they lack spirit and are so weary when at last they come up against their initial frontier that they no longer have the energy to look beyond toward the neverborn It is not my beginnings it is the beginning that matters to me If I bump into my birth into a minor obsession it is because I cannot grapple with the first moment of time Every individual discomfort leads back ultimately to a cosmogonie discomfort each of our sensations expiating that crime of the primordial sensation by which Being crept out of somewhere  Though we may prefer ourselves to the universe we nonetheless loathe ourselves much more than we suspect If the wise man is so rare a phenomenon it is because he seems unshaken by the aversion which like all beings he must feel for himself No difference between being and nonbeing if we apprehend them with the same intensity Nescience is the basis of everything it creates everything by an action repeated every moment it produces this and any world since it continually takes for real what in fact is not Nescience is the tremendous mistake that serves as the basis of all our truths it is older and more powerful than all the gods combined This is how we recognize the man who has tendencies toward an inner quest he will set failure above any success he will even seek it out unconsciously of course This is because failure always essential reveals us to ourselves permits us to see ourselves as God sees us whereas success distances us from what is most inward in ourselves and indeed in everything There was a time when time did not yet exist  The rejection of birth is nothing but the nostalgia for this time before time I think of so many friends who are no more and I pity them Yet they are not so much to be pitied for they have solved every problem beginning with the problem of death In the fact of being born there is such an absence of necessity that when you think about it a little more than usual you are left ignorant how to react with a foolish grin Two kinds of mind daylight and nocturnal They have neither the same method nor the same morality In broad daylight you watch yourself in the dark you speak out The salutary or awkward consequences of what he thinks matter little to the man who questions himself at hours when others are the prey of sleep Hence he meditates upon the bad luck of being born without concern for the harm he can cause others or himself After midnight begins the intoxication of pernicious truths As the years accumulate we form an increasingly somber image of the future Is this only to console ourselves for being excluded from it Yes in appearance no in fact for the future has always been hideous man being able to remedy his evils only by aggravating them so that in each epoch existence is much more tolerable before the solution is found to the difficulties of the moment In major perplexities try to live as if history were done with and to react like a monster riddled by serenity If I used to ask myself over a coffin What good did it do the occupant to be born I now put the same question about anyone alive The emphasis on birth is no more than the craving for the insoluble carried to the point of insanity Regarding death I ceaselessly waver between mystery and inconsequentiality between the Pyramids and the Morgue It is impossible to feel that there was a time when we did not exist Hence our attachment to the personage we were before being born Meditate but one hour upon the selfs nonexistence and you will feel yourself to be another man said a priest of the Japanese Kusha sea to a Western visitor Without having frequented the Buddhist monasteries how many times have I not lingered over the world s unreality and hence my own I have not become another man for that no but there certainly has remained with me the feeling that my identity is entirely illusory and that by losing it I have lost nothing except something except everything Instead of clinging to the fact of being born as good sense bids I take the risk I turn back I retrogress increasingly toward some unknown beginning I move from origin to origin Some day perhaps I shall manage to reach origin itself in order to rest there or be wrecked X insults me I am about to hit him Thinking it over I refrain Who am I which is my real self the self of the retort or that of the refraining My first reaction is always energetic the second one flabby What is known as wisdom is ultimately only a perpetual thinking it over ie nonaction as first impulse If attachment is an evil we must look for its cause in the scandal of birth for to be born is to be attached Detachment then should apply itself to getting rid of the traces of this scandal the most serious and intolerable of all Amid anxiety and distress sudden calm at the thought of the foetus one has been At this precise moment no reproach proceeding from men or gods can affect me I have as good a conscience as if I had never existed It is a mistake to believe in a direct relation between suffering reverses and being dead set against birth Such opposition has deeper more distant roots and would occur even if one had only the shadow of a grievance against existence In fact it is never more virulent than in cases of extreme good fortune Thracians and Bogomils I cannot forget that I have haunted the same whereabouts as they nor that the former wept over the newborn and the latter in order to justify God held Satan responsible for the infamy of Creation During the long nights in the caves how many Hamlets must have murmured their endless monologues for it is likely that the apogee of metaphysical torment is to be located well before that universal insipidity which followed the advent of Philosophy The obsession with birth proceeds from an exacerbation of memory from an omnipresence of the past as well as from a craving for the impasse for the first impasse No openness hence no joy from the past but solely from the present and from a future emancipated from time For years in fact for life to have meditated only on your last moments only to discover when at last you approach them that it was of no use that the thought of death helps in everything save in dying It is our discomforts which provoke which create consciousness their task accomplished they weaken and disappear one after the other Consciousness however remains and survives them without recalling what it owes to them without even ever having known Hence it continually proclaims its autonomy its sovereignty even when it loathes itself and would do away with itself According to the Rule of Saint Benedict if a monk became proud of or merely satisfied with the task he was performing he was to forsake it then and there One danger not dreaded by the man who has lived in the thirst for unsatisfaction in an orgy of remorse and disgust If it is true that God dislikes taking sides I should feel no awkwardness in His presence so pleased would I be to imitate Him to be like Him in everything without opinion To get up in the morning wash and then wait for some unforeseen variety of dread or depression I would give the whole universe and all of Shakespeare for a grain of ataraxy Nietzsche s great luck to have ended as he did in euphoria Endlessly to refer to a world where nothing yet stooped to occurrence where you anticipated consciousness without desiring it where wallowing in the virtual you rejoiced in the null plenitude of a self anterior to selfhood  Not to have been born merely musing on that what happiness what freedom what space  If disgust for the world conferred sanctity of itself I fail to see how I could avoid canonization No one has lived so close to his skeleton as I have lived to mine from which results an endless dialogue and certain truths which I manage neither to accept nor to reject It is easier to get on with vices than with virtues The vices accommodating by nature help each other are full of mutual indulgence whereas the jealous virtues combat and annihilate each other showing in everything their incompatibility and their intolerance It is trifling to believe in what you do or in what others do You should avoid simulacra and even realities you should take up a position external to everything and everyone drive off or grind down your appetites live according to a Hindu adage with as few desires as a solitary elephant I forgive X everything because of his obsolete smile Not one moment when I have not been conscious of being outside Paradise Only what you hide is profound is true Whence the power of base feelings Ama nesari says the Imitation of Christ Love to be unknown We are happy with ourselves and with the world only when we conform to this precept The intrinsic value of a book does not depend on the importance of its subject else the theologians would prevail and mightily  but on the manner of approaching the accidental and the insignificant of mastering the infinitesimal The essential has never required the least talent The feeling of being ten thousand years behind or ahead of the others of belonging to the beginnings or to the end of humanity Negation never proceeds from reasoning but from something much more obscure and old Arguments come afterward to justify and sustain it Every no rises out of the blood With the help of the erosion of memory to recall the first initiatives of matter and the risk of life which followed from them Each time I fail to think about death I have the impression of cheating of deceiving someone in me There are nights that the most ingenious torturers could not have invented We emerge from them in pieces stupid dazed with neither memories nor anticipations and without even knowing who we are And it is then that the day seems useless light pernicious even more oppressive than the darkness A conscious fruit fly would have to confront exactly the same difficulties the same kind of insoluble problems as man Better to be an animal than a man an insect than an animal a plant than an insect and so on Salvation Whatever diminishes the kingdom of consciousness and compromises its supremacy I have all the defects of other people and yet everything they do seems to me inconceivable Considering things according to nature man was made to live facing outward If he would see into himself he must close his eyes renounce his endeavors quit the immediate What is called inner life is a belated phenomenon possible only by a slowing down of our vital activities the soul being able to emerge and elaborate itself only at the expense of the good behavior of our organs The merest atmospheric variation jeopardizes my plans not to speak of my convictions This kind of dependency the most humiliating kind unfailingly lays me low even as it dissipates what few illusions remain as to my possibilities of being free and as to freedom itself What is the use of swaggering if you are at the mercy of Wet and Dry One craves a less lamentable bondage and gods of another kidney It s not worth the bother of killing yourself since you always kill yourself too late When you know quite absolutely that everything is unreal you then cannot see why you should take the trouble to prove it As it leaves dawn behind and advances into the day light prostitutes itself and is redeemed ethics of twilight only at the moment it vanishes In Buddhist writings mention is often made of the abyss of birth An abyss indeed a gulf into which we do not fall but from which instead we emerge to our universal chagrin At increasingly wider intervals impulses of gratitude toward Job and Chamfort toward vociferation and vitriol Each opinion each view is necessarily partial truncated inadequate In philosophy and in anything originality comes down to incomplete definitions If we consider closely our socalled generous actions there is none which from some aspect is not blameworthy and even harmful so that we come to regret having performed it so that we must choose finally between abstention and remorse Explosive force of any mortification Every vanquished desire affords us power We have the more hold over this world the further we withdraw from it the less we adhere to it Renunciation confers an infinite power My disappointments instead of converging toward a center and constituting if not a system at least an ensemble are scattered each supposing itself unique and thereby wasted lacking organization The only successful philosophies and religions are the ones that flatter us whether in the name of progress or of hell Damned or not man experiences an absolute need to be at the heart of everything It is in fact solely for this reason that he is man that he has become man And if some day he no longer feels this need he must give way to some other animal prouder madder than himself He detested objective truths the burden of argument sustained reasoning He disliked demonstrating he wanted to convince no one Others are a dialectician s invention The more injured you are by time the more you seek to escape it To write a faultless page or only a sentence raises you above becoming and its corruptions You transcend death by the pursuit of the indestructible in speech in the very symbol of nullity At the climax of a failure at the moment when shame is about to do us in suddenly we are swept away by a frenzy of pride which lasts only long enough to drain us to leave us without energy to lower with our powers the intensity of our shame If death is as horrible as is claimed how is it that after the passage of a certain period of time we consider happy any being friend or enemy who has ceased to live More than once I have managed to leave my room for if I had stayed there I could not be sure of being able to resist some sudden resolution The street is more reassuring you think less about yourself there there everything weakens and wilts beginning with your own confusion Characteristic of sickness to stay awake when everything sleeps when everything is at rest even the sick man When we are young we take a certain pleasure in our infirmities They seem so new so rich With age they no longer surprise us we know them too well Now without anything unexpected in them they do not deserve to be endured Once we appeal to our most intimate selves once we begin to labor and to produce we lay claim to gifts we become unconscious of our own gaps No one is in a position to admit that what comes out of his own depths might be worthless Selfknowledge  A contradiction in terms All these poems where it is merely the Poem that is in question a whole poetry with no other substance than itself What would we say of a prayer whose object was religion The mind that puts everything in question reaches after a thousand interrogations an almost total inertia a situation which the inert in fact knows from the start by instinct For what is inertia but a congenital perplexity What a disappointment that Epicurus the sage I most need should have written over three hundred treatises And what a relief that they are lost What do you do from morning to night I endure myself A remark of my brother s apropos of the troubles and pains our mother endured Old age is nature s selfcriticism One must be mad or drunk the Abbe Sieyes said to speak well in the known languages One must be drunk or mad I should add to dare still to use words any word  The fanatic of elliptical gloom is sure to excel in any career save that of being a writer Having always lived in fear of being surprised by the worst I have tried in every circumstance to get a head start flinging myself into misfortune long before it occurred We do not envy those who have the capacity to pray whereas we are filled with envy of the possessors of goods of those who know wealth and fame Strange that we resign ourselves to someone s salvation and not to what fugitive advantages he may enjoy I never met one Interesting mind that was not richly endowed with inadmissible deficiencies No true art without a strong dose of banality The constant employment of the unaccustomed readily wearies us nothing being more unendurable than the uniformity of the exceptional The trouble with using a borrowed language is that you have no right to make too many mistakes in it Now it is by seeking a certain incorrectness without however abusing it it is by continually approaching solecism that writing may be given the appearance of life Each of us believes quite unconsciously of course that he alone pursues the truth which the rest are incapable of seeking out and unworthy of attaining This madness is so deeprooted and so useful that it is impossible to realize what would become of each of us if it were someday to disappear The first thinker was without a doubt the first man obsessed by why An unaccustomed mania not at all contagious rare indeed are those who suffer from it who are a prey to questioning and who can accept no given because they were born in consternation To be objective is to treat others as you treat an object a corpse to behave with them like an undertaker This very second has vanished forever lost in the anonymous mass of the irrevocable It will never return I suffer from this and I do not Everything is unique and insignificant Emily Bronte everything that comes from her has the capacity to overwhelm me Haworth is my Mecca To walk along a stream to pass to flow with the water without effort without haste while death continues in us its ruminations its uninterrupted soliloquy Only God has the privilege of abandoning us Men can only drop us Without the faculty of forgetting our past would weigh so heavily on our present that we should not have the strength to confront another moment still less to live through it Life would be bearable only to frivolous natures those in fact who do not remember Plotinus Porphyry tells us had the gift of reading men s souls One day without any warning he told his astounded disciple not to try killing himself but rather to take a journey Porphyry left for Sicily there he was cured of his melancholy but he adds regretfully he thereby missed being present at his master s death which occurred during his absence It has been a long time since philosophers have read men s souls It is not their task we are told Perhaps But we must not be surprised if they no longer matter much to us A work exists only if it is elaborated in the darkness with attention with all the care of the murderer plotting his crime In both cases what counts is the will to strike Selfknowledge the bitterest knowledge of all and also the kind we cultivate least what is the use of catching ourselves out morning to night in the act of illusion pitilessly tracing each act back to its root and losing case after case before our own tribunal Each time I have a lapse of memory I think of the anguish which must afflict those who know they no longer remember anything But something tells me that after a certain time a secret joy possesses them a joy they would not agree to trade for any of their memories even the most stirring  To claim you are more detached more alien to everything than anyone and to be merely a fanatic of indifference The more you are a victim of contradictory impulses the less you know which to yield to To lack character precisely that and nothing but Pure time time decanted freed of events beings and things appears only at certain moments of the night when you feel it coming on with the one intention of sweeping you off toward an exemplary catastrophe  Suddenly feeling that you know as much as God about anything and everything and quite as suddenly seeing this sensation vanish Firsthand thinkers meditate upon things the others upon problems We must live face to face with being and not with the mind What are you waiting for in order to give up Each sickness sends us a summons disguised as a question We play deaf even as we realize that the game is played out and that next time we must have the courage at last to capitulate The older I grow the less I react to frenzy delirium My taste among thinkers now goes only to extinct volcanoes As a young man I bored myself to death but I believed in myself If I had no suspicion of the dreary creature I was to become I knew nonetheless that whatever happened Perplexity would not desert me that it would keep watch over my years with all the zeal and exactitude of Providence If we could see ourselves as others see us we would vanish on the spot I once remarked to an Italian friend that the Latin peoples are without secrecy too open too garrulous and that I preferred nations ravaged by timidity adding that a writer who has failed to know it in his life is worthless in his writings You re right he answered When we describe our experiences in our books there is a lack of intensity and of extension for we have already told them a hundred times before Whereupon we talked about the literature of femininity of its absence of mystery in countries where the salon and the confessional prevail We should never deprive ourselves I forget who once remarked of the pleasures of piety Has religion ever been justified more delicately This craving to revise our enthusiasms to change idols to pray elsewhere To stretch out in a field to smell the earth and tell yourself it is the end as well as the hope of our dejections that it would be futile to search for anything better to fest on to dissolve into When I happen to be busy I never give a moment s thought to the meaning of anything particularly of whatever it is I am doing A proof that the secret of everything is in action and not in abstention that fatal cause of consciousness What will be the physiognomy of painting of poetry of music in a hundred years No one can tell As after the fall of Athens of Rome a long pause will intervene caused by the exhaustion of the means of expression as well as by the exhaustion of consciousness itself Humanity to rejoin the past must invent a second naivete without which the arts can never begin again In one of the chapels of this ideally ugly church we find the Virgin standing with her Son above the globe an aggressive sect which has undermined and conquered an empire and inherited its flaws beginning with gigantism It is written in the Zohar When man appeared thereupon appeared the flowers I suspect they were there long before him and that his advent plunged them all into a stupefaction from which they have not yet recovered Impossible to read a line by Kleist without thinking that he committed suicide as if his suicide had preceded his works In the Orient the oddest the most idiosyncratic Western thinkers would never have been taken seriously on account of their contradictions This is precisely why we are interested in them We prefer not a mind but the reversals the biography of a mind the incompatibilities and aberrations to be found there in short those thinkers who unable to conform to the rest of humanity and still less to themselves cheat as much by whim as by fatality Their distinctive sign A touch of fakery in the tragic a hint of dalliance even in the irremediable If in her Foundations Teresa of Avila lingers over the subject of melancholia it is because she recognizes it as incurable Physicians she says cannot deal with it and the mother superior of a convent faced with such sufferers has but one recourse to inspire them with the dread of authority to threaten them to frighten them The saint s method remains the best only kicks slaps and a good beating will be effective in the case of a depressive Moreover such treatment is precisely what the depressive himself resorts to when he decides to end it all he merely employs more thorough means In relation to any act of life the mind acts as a killjoy Easy to imagine the elements bored with their exhausted theme disgusted by their invariable and utterly predictable combinations seeking some diversion life would be merely a digression merely an anecdote  Anything that can be done seems to me pernicious and at best futile If need be I can rouse myself but not act I understand all too well Wordsworth s description of Coleridge eternal activity without action Whenever something still seems possible I have the sense I have been bewitched The one sincere confession is the one we make indirectly when we talk about other people We do not adopt a belief because it is true they are all true  but because some obscure power impels us to do so When this power leaves us we suffer prostration and collapse a teteatete with what is left of ourselves The quality of every perfect form is to release the mind immediately whereas the corrupt form holds the mind prisoner like a bad mirror which tells us of nothing but itself In Kleist s praise and how unGerman it sounds of limpidity his target was not philosophy in particular Yet his is the best possible critique of philosophical jargon a pseudolanguage which attempting to reflect ideas merely assumes a contour at their expense merely denatures and darkens them merely calls attention to itself By one of the most troublesome of all usurpations the word has taken the leading role in a realm where it should be imperceptible O Satan my Master I give myself unto thee forever How I regret not remembering the name of the nun who having written these words with a nail dipped in her own blood deserves to figure in an anthology of prayer and concision Consciousness is much more than the thorn it is the dagger in the flesh Ferocity occurs in all conditions save in joy Schadenfreude malicious joy is a misrepresentation To do evil is a pleasure not a joy Joy the one true victory over the world is pure in its essence hence irreducible to pleasure which is always suspect both in itself and in its manifestations An existence constantly transfigured by failure The wise man consents to everything for he identifies himself with nothing An opportunist without desires Nature s great mistake was to have been unable to confine herself to one kingdom juxtaposed with the vegetable everything else seems inopportune out of place The sun should have sulked at the appearance of the first insect and gone out altogether with the advent of the chimpanzee If as we grow older we scrutinize our own past at the expense of problems it is simply because we handle memories more readily than ideas The last whose disloyalty wre forgive are those we have disappointed What other people do we always feel we could do better Unfortunately we do not have the same feeling about what we ourselves do I was the Prophet Mohammed informs us when Adam was still between the water and the clay When we have not had the pride to found a religion or at least to destroy one how do we dare show ourselves in the light of day Detachment cannot be learned it is inscribed in a civilization We do not tend toward it we discover it in ourselves I was thinking this when I read that a missionary after eighteen years in Japan had made only sixty converts and old ones at that Moreover they escaped him at the last moment dying in Japanese fashion without remorse without torments worthy descendants of their ancestors who to inure themselves In the days of the Mongol wars let themselves be impregnated by the nothingness of all things and by their own nothingness We can meditate upon eternity only in a prone position For a considerable period eternity was the Orientals principal concern did they not prefer the horizontal position Once we lie down time ceases to pass to count History is the product of a race that stands As a vertical animal man was to get into the habit of looking ahead not only in space but in time as well To which wretched origins we may trace the Future Every misanthrope however sincere at times reminds me of that old poet bedridden and utterly forgotten who in a rage with his contemporaries declared he would receive none of them His wife out of charity would ring at the door from time to time  A work is finished when we can no longer improve it though we know it to be inadequate and incomplete We are so overtaxed by it that we no longer have the power to add a single comma however indispensable What determines the degree to which a work is done is not a requirement of art or of truth it is exhaustion and even more disgust Whereas any sentence one has to write requires a pretense of invention it takes little enough attention to enter into a text even a difficult one To scribble a postcard comes closer to creative activity than to read The Phenomenology of Mind Buddhism calls anger corruption of the mind manicheism root of the tree of death I know this but what good does it do me to know She meant absolutely nothing to me Realizing suddenly after so many years that whatever happens i shall never see her again I nearly collapsed We understand what death is only by suddenly remembering the face of someone who has been a matter of indifference to us As art sinks into paralysis artists multiply This anomaly ceases to be one if we realize that art on its way to exhaustion has become both impossible and easy No one is responsible for what he is nor even for what he does This is obvious and everyone more or less agrees that it is so Then why celebrate or denigrate Because to exist is to evaluate to emit judgments and because abstention when it is not the effect of apathy or cowardice requires an effort no one manages to make Every form of haste even toward the good betrays some mental disorder The least impure thoughts are those which appear between our anxieties in the intervals of our annoyance in those deluxe moments our misery grants itself Imaginary pains are by far the most real we suffer since we feel a constant need for them and invent them because there is no way of doing without them If it is characteristic of the wise man to do nothing useless no one will surpass me in wisdom I do not even lower myself to useful things Impossible to imagine a degraded animal a subanimal O to have been born before man Try as I will I cannot manage to scorn all those centuries during which men busied themselves with nothing more than perfecting a definition of God The most effective way to avoid dejection motivated or gratuitous is to take a dictionary preferably of a language you scarcely know and to look up word after word in it making sure that they are the kind you will never use  As long as you live on this side of the terrible you will find words to express it once you know it from inside you will no longer find a single one There is no limitdisappointment Grievances of every kind pass but their source abides and nothing has any effect on it unassailable and unvarying it is our fatum To realize in rage and desolation alike that nature as Bossuet says will not long grant us this morsel of matter she lends This morsel of matter  by dint of pondering it we reach peace though a peace it would be better never to have known Paradox is not suited to burials nor to weddings or births in fact Sinister or grotesque events require commonplaces the terrible like the painful accommodates only the cliche However disabused one may be it is impossible to live without any hope at all We always keep one unwittingly and this unconscious hope makes up for all the explicit others we have rejected exhausted The more laden he is with years the more readily he speaks of his death as a distant quite unlikely event Life is now such a habit that he has become unfit for death A blind man authentically blind for once held out his hand in his posture his rigidity there was something that caught you that made you hold your breath He was handing you his blindness We forgive only madmen and children for being frank with us others if they have the audacity to imitate them will regret it sooner or later To be happy you must constantly bear in mind the miseries you have escaped This would be a way for memory to redeem itself since ordinarily it preserves only disasters eager and with what success to sabotage happiness After a sleepless night the people in the street seem automatons No one seems to breathe to walk Each looks as if he is worked by clockwork nothing spontaneous mechanical smiles spectral gesticulations Yourself a specter how would you see others as alive To be sterile with so many sensations Perpetual poetry without words Pure fatigue fatigue without cause the kind that comes like a gift or a scourge that is what helps me pull myself together that is what affords me knowledge of my self Once it leaves me I am no more than an inanimate object Anything in folklore that remains alive comes from before Christianity The same is true of whatever is alive in each of us A man who fears ridicule will never go far for good or ill he remains on this side of his talents and even if he has genius he is doomed to mediocrity Amid your most intense activities pause a moment to consider your mind this advice is surely not offered to those who consider their minds night and day and who thereby have no need to suspend their activities for the good reason that they engage in none Only what has been conceived in solitude face to face with God endures whether one is a believer or not A passion for musk is in itself an avowal We know more about a stranger who yields himself up to it than about someone who Is deaf to musk and whom we see every day No meditation without a tendency to repetitiveness As long as God had him in tow man advanced slowly so slowly he did not even realize it Now that he no longer lives in anyone s shadow he is in a rush and deplores it he would give anything to regain the old cadence We have lost being born as much as we shall lose dying Everything Satiety I have just now uttered this word and already I no longer know apropos of what so readily does it apply to everything I feel and think to everything I love and loathe to satiety itself I have killed no one I have done better I have killed the Possible and like Macbeth what I need most is to pray but like him too I cannot say Amen  To deliver Mows none of which land to attack everyone without anyone s noticing to shoot arrows whose poison you alone receive X whom I have always treated as badly as I could does not resent me because he resents no one He forgives every insult he even forgets them How I envy him To be like him I should have to live through several existences and exhaust all my possibilities of transmigration In the days when I set off on monthlong bicycle trips across France my greatest pleasure was to stop in country cemeteries to stretch out between two graves and to smoke for hours on end I think of those days as the most active period of my life How can you control yourself master your behavior when you come from a country where people howl at funerals On certain mornings no sooner have I stepped out the door than I hear voices calling my name Am I really me Is it really my take another step I stood there nailed to the spot petrified IMPOSSIBILITY this ordinary word came more apropos than usual to enlighten me as to myself no less than as to the word as well it had so often come to my aid yet never as now At last I understood definitively what it meant  An ancient cleaning woman in answer to my How s everything going answers without looking up Taking its course This ultrabanal answer nearly brings me to tears The more such turns of speech which deal with becoming with the passage of time with the course of things are worn down the more likely they are to acquire the quality of a revelation But the truth is not that they create an exceptional state only that you yourself were in that state without realizing it and that it required only a sign or a pretext for the extraordinary to occur We lived in the country I went to school and an important detail I slept in my parents room At night it was my father s habit to read aloud to my mother Though he was a Greek Orthodox priest he would read anything doubtless assuming that at my age I wouldn t understand Usually I didn t even listen and fell asleep unless the text was some gripping story One night I pricked up my ears He was reading the scene from a biography of Rasputin where the father on his deathbed calls his son to him and says Go to Saint Petersburg and make yourself master of the city fear nothing and no one for God is an old hog Such an enormity in my father s mouth for whom the priesthood was not a joke impressed me as much as a conflagration or an earthquake But I also distinctly recall this was over fifty years ago that my emotion was followed by a strange dare I say a perverse pleasure Having penetrated in the course of years quite deeply into two or three religions I have always retreated on the threshold of conversion lest I lie to myself None of them was in my eyes free enough to admit that vengeance is a need the most intense and profound of all and that each man must satisfy it if only in words If we stifle that need we expose ourselves to serious disturbances More than one disorder perhaps all disorders derive from a vengeance too long postponed We must learn how to explode Any disease is healthier than the one provoked by a hoarded rage Philosophy in the Morgue My nephew was obviously a failure If he had succeeded in making something of himself he would have had a different ending than this You know Madame I replied to the monumental matron who had addressed me whether one succeeds or not comes down to the same thing You re right she said after a few seconds thought This unexpected acquiescence on the part of such a woman moved me almost as much as the death of my friend Misfits It seems to me that their adventure more than any other sheds a light on the future that they alone allow us to glimpse and to decipher it and that if we set their exploits aside we utterly disqualify ourselves from describing the days to come A pity you were saying that N has never produced anything So what He exists If he had given birth to books if he had had the misfortune to realize himself we wouldn t have been talking about him the last hour The advantage of being someone is rarer than that of creating To produce is easy what is difficult is to scorn the use of one s gifts Filming a scene there are countless takes of the same incident Someone watching in the street obviously a provincial can t get over it After this I ll never go to the movies again One might react similarly with regard to anything whose underside one has seen whose secret one has seized Yet by an obnubilation which has something of the miraculous about it there are gynecologists who are attracted to their patients gravediggers who father children incurables who lay plans skeptics who write  T a rabbi s son complains that this age of unprecedented persecutions has seen the birth of no original prayer capable of being adopted by the community and uttered in the synagogues I assure him that he is mistaken to be distressed or alarmed by the fact the great disasters yield nothing on the literary or religious level Only the semimisfortunes are fruitful because they can be because they are a point of departure whereas too perfect a hell is almost as sterile as paradise I was twenty Everything was a burden One day I collapsed on a couch with an I can t take it any longer My mother already driven distracted by my sleepless nights told me she had just had a mass said for my rest Not one but thirty thousand I would have liked to shout at her thinking of the figure Charles V inscribed in his will for a much longer rest true enough I ran across him again quite by chance after twentyfive years Unchanged intact fresher than ever he actually seems to have retreated toward adolescence Where has he been hiding and what has he done to escape the action of the years to avoid our wrinkles and grimaces And how has he lived if in fact he has lived at all Actually a ghost He must have cheated he has not performed his duty as a living man not played the game A ghost yes and a gatecrasher I discern no sign of destruction on his countenance none of those marks which testify that one is a real being an individual and not an apparition What can I say to him I feel awkward embarrassed even afraid So greatly are we upset by anyone who escapes time or merely deceives it DC who was writing his recollections of childhood in his Rumanian village having told his neighbor a peasant named Coman that he wouldn t be left out received a visit from the latter early the next day I know I m a worthless man but all the same I didn t think I had fallen so low as to be talked about in a book How superior the oral world was to ours Beings I should say peoples live in the truth only as long as they have a horror of the written Once they catch the virus they enter the inauthentic they lose their old superstitions to acquire a new one worse than all the others combined Incapable of getting up nailed to my bed I drift with the whims of my memory and I see myself wandering as a child in the Carpathians One day I stumbled on a dog whose master doubtless to be rid of it had tied it to a tree the animal was little more than a skeleton so drained of life that it barely had the strength to look at me without being able to move Yet it was standing that dog  A stranger comes and tells me he has killed someone He is not wanted by the police because no one suspects him I am the only one who knows he is the killer What am I to do I lack the courage as well as the treachery for he has entrusted me with a secret and what a secret to tum him in I feel I am his accomplice and resign myself to being arrested and punished as such At the same time I tell myself this would be too ridiculous Perhaps I shall go and denounce him all the same And so on until I wake up The interminable is the specialty of the indecisive They cannot mark life out for their own and still less their dreams in which they perpetuate their hesitations pusillanimities scruples They are ideally qualified for nightmare A film about wild animals endless cruelty in every latitude Nature a torturer of genius steeped in herself and her work exults with good reason there is not a moment when what is alive fails to tremble to make others tremble Pity is a strange luxury only the most perfidious and the fiercest creature could invent out of a need to punish and torture itself out of ferocity still On a poster which at a church door announces The Art of the Fugue someone has scrawled in huge letters God is dead This apropos of the composer who testifies that God in the event of his decease can revive precisely while we are listening to certain cantatas certain fugues We have spent a little over an hour together He has used the time to show off and by dint of trying to say interesting things about himself has succeeded If he had merely swaggered in moderation I should have found him a bore and left in a few minutes By exaggerating by playing the peacock to perfection he has come close enough to wit to show some The desire to appear subtle does not destroy subtlety A mental defective if he could feel the longing to astonish would manage to deceive us would even catch up with intelligence X who is older than the patriarchs after inveighing during a long teteatete against this one and that tells me The great weakness of my life is that I ve never hated anyone Our hatred does not diminish with the years in fact it mounts That of an old man like X attains incredible proportions now insensitive to his former affections he puts all his faculties at the service of his rancors which miraculously reinvigorated will survive the crumbling of his memory and even of his reason The danger of frequenting the old is that when we find them so far from detachment and so incapable of espousing it we arrogate to ourselves all the advantages they are supposed to have and do not And it is inevitable that our real or imaginary advance upon them in matters of weariness or disgust should incite to presumption Every family has its own philosophy One of my cousins who died young once wrote me It s all the way it s always been and probably always will be until there s nothing left any more Whereas my mother ended the last note she ever sent me with this testamentary sentence Whatever people try to do they ll regret it sooner or later Nor can I even boast of having acquired this vice of regret by my own setbacks It precedes me it participates in the patrimony of my tribe What a legacy such unfitness for illusion A few kilometers from the village where I was born there was a hamlet perched on a hill and inhabited solely by gypsies In  an amateur ethnologist visited the place accompanied by a photographer He managed to collect the inhabitants who agreed to let their picture be taken without knowing what that meant At the instant they were asked to hold still an old woman shrieked Watch out they re stealing our souls Whereupon they all flung themselves upon the two visitors who had the greatest difficulty making their escape These halfsavage gypsies what were they but India their land of origin which under these circumstances was speaking through them In continual rebellion against my ancestry I have spent my whole life wanting to be something else Spanish Russian cannibal anything except what I was It is an aberration to want to be different from what you are to espouse in theory any and every condition except your own The day I read the list of nearly all the Sanskrit words that designate the absolute I realized that I had taken the wrong path the wrong country the wrong idiom A friend after I don t know how many years of silence writes that she hasn t much longer to live and that she is preparing to enter the Unknown  The cliche gives me a start I find it hard to see what one might enter by death Any affirmation in this realm seems to me a delusion Death is not a state perhaps not even a transition Then what is it And by what cliche in my turn will I answer my friend I may change my opinion on the same subject the same event ten twenty thirty times in the course of a single day And to think that each time like the worst impostor I dare utter the word truth  Hale and hearty still the woman dragged her husband after her a tall hunched man eyes staring she dragged him as if he had been the survivor of another age an apoplectic and suppliant diplodocus An hour later a second encounter a neatly dressed old woman extremely stooped advanced toward me her body forming a perfect half circle she necessarily kept her eyes on the ground doubtless counting her unimaginable slow tiny footsteps It was as if she were learning how to walk as if she were afraid of not knowing how and where to place her feet in order to move Everything is good which brings me closer to Buddha Despite her white hair she still paraded up and down her part of the sidewalk looking for customers I would run into her often at three in the morning and never felt like going home until I had heard her tell a few anecdotes or exploits I have forgotten anecdotes and exploits alike but not the readiness with which one night when I had begun storming against all the sleeping Vermin of Paris she broke in with her forefinger pointing to heaven and What about the vermin up there Everything is without basis without substance and I never repeat it to myself without feeling something like happiness Unfortunately there are so many moments when I fail to repeat it to myself  I read him for the shipwrecked feeling I get from anything he writes At first you follow then you start going in circles then you are caught up in a kind of mild unmenacing whirlpool and you tell yourself you re sinking and then you do sink But you don t really drown that would be too easy You come back up to the surface you follow all over again amazed to see he seems to be saying something and to understand what it is and then you start going round and round again and you sink once more  All of which is meant to be profound and seems so But once you come to your senses you realize it s only abstruse obscure and that the distance between real profundity and the willed kind is as great as between a revelation and a whim Anyone who gives himself up to writing believes without realizing the fact that his work will survive the years the ages time itself If he felt while he was at work on it that it was perishable he would leave off where he was he could never finish Activity and credulity are correlative terms Laughter ceased and after laughter smiles This apparently naive remark by a biographer of Alexsandr Blok defines to perfection the program of any and every downfall No easy matter to speak of God when one is neither a believer nor an atheist and it is undoubtedly the drama we all share theologians included no longer capable of being either one or the other For a writer progress toward detachment and deliverance is an unprecedented disaster He more than anyone else needs his defects if he triumphs over them he is lost He must be careful then not to improve for if he succeeds he will regret it bitterly We must beware of whatever insights we have into ourselves Our selfknowledge annoys and paralyzes our daimon this is where we should look for the reason Socrates wrote nothing What makes bad poets worse is that they read only poets just as bad philosophers read only philosophers  whereas they would benefit much more from a book of botany or geology We are enriched only by frequenting disciplines remote from our own This is true of course only for realms where the ego is rampant Tertullian tells us that in order to be cured epileptics would go and greedily suck the blood of criminals slaughtered in the arena If I were to heed my instinct this would be the one type of medication no matter what the disease which I would adopt What right have we to be annoyed by someone who calls us a monster The monster Is unique by definition and solitude even the solitude of infamy supposes something positive a peculiar election but undeniably an election Two enemies the same man divided Never judge a man without putting yourself in his place This old proverb makes all judgment impossible for we judge someone only because in fact we cannot put ourselves in his place If you love your independence you must lend yourself in order to protect it to every turpitude you must risk ignominy itself Nothing more abominable than the critic and a fortiori the philosopher in each of us if I were a poet I should behave like Dylan Thomas who when people would discuss his poems in his presence would drop to the floor in a fit of convulsions Anyone who bestirs himself commits one injustice after the next without a trace of remorse Just bad humor Remorse is for those who do nothing who cannot act It replaces action for them consoles them for their inefiectuality Most of our troubles come from our first impulses The slightest enthusiasm costs more than a crime Since we remember clearly only our ordeals it is ultimately the sick the persecuted the victims in every realm who will have lived to the best advantage The others the lucky ones have a life of course but not the memory of a life What a bore someone who doesn t deign to make an impression Vain people are almost always annoying but they make an effort they take the trouble they are bores who don t want to be bores and we are grateful to them for that we end by enduring them even by seeking them out On the other hand we turn livid with fury in the presence of someone who pays no attention whatever to the effect he makes What are we to say to him and what are we to expect from him Either keep some vestiges of the monkey or else stay home Not the fear of effort but the fear of success explains more than one failure I d like to pray with daggerwords Unfortunately if you pray at all you have to pray like everyone else Wherein abides one of the greatest difficulties of faith We dread the future only when we are not sure we can kill ourselves when we want to Neither Bossuet nor Malebranche nor Fenelon deigned to mention the Pensees apparently Pascal didn t strike them as sufficiently serious Fear is the antidote to boredom the remedy must be stronger than the disease If only I could reach the level of the man I would have liked to be But some power increasing year by year draws me down Even to get back up to my surface I have to employ stratagems I cannot think of without blushing There was a time when in order to dispel any impulse of vengeance once I had endured some affront I would imagine myself quite still in my grave And I calmed down at once We must not despise our corpse too much it can be useful on occasion Every thought derives from a thwarted sensation The only way to reach another person at any depth is to move toward what is deepest in yourself In other words to take the opposite path from the one followed by socalled generous minds If only I could say with that Hasidic rabbi The blessing of my life is that I have never needed a thing before I possessed it In permitting man Nature has committed much more than a mistake in her calculations a crime against herself Fear creates consciousness not natural fear but morbid fear Otherwise animals would have achieved a level of consciousness higher than ours As orangutang in the strict sense of the word man is old as historical orangutang he is comparatively recent a parvenu who has not had time to learn how to behave in life After certain experiences we should change names since we ourselves are no longer the same Everything assumes another aspect starting with death Which seems close and desirable we are reconciled to it and we reach the point of calling it man s best friend as Mozart does in a letter to his dying father We must suffer to the end to the moment when we stop believing in suffering Truth remains hidden to the man filled with desire and hatred Buddha  Which is to say to every man alive Won over by solitude yet he remains in the world a stylite without a pillar You were wrong to count on me Who can speak in such terms God and the Failure Everything we achieve everything that comes out of us aspires to forget its origins and succeeds only by opposing us Hence the negative sign that marks all our successes There is nothing to say about anything So there can be no limit to the number of books Failure even repeated always seems fresh whereas success multiplied loses all interest all attraction It is not misfortune but happiness insolent happiness it is true which leads to rancor and sarcasm An enemy is as useful as a Buddha Exactly for our enemy watches over us keeps us from letting ourselves go By indicating by divulging our least weakness he leads us straight to our salvation moves heaven and earth to keep us from being unworthy of his image of us Hence our gratitude to him should be boundless We get a better hold of ourselves and of being when we have reacted against negating dissolving books against their noxious power Fortifying books actually since they provoke the very energy which denies them The more poison they contain the more salutary their effect provided we read them against the grain as we should read any book starting with the catechism The greatest favor we can do an author is to forbid him to work during a certain period Shortterm tyrannies are necessary prohibitions which would suspend all intellectual activity Uninterrupted freedom of expression exposes talent to a deadly danger forces it beyond its means and keeps it from stockpiling sensations and experiences Unlimited freedom is a crime against the mind Selfpity is not so sterile as we suppose Once we feel its mere onset we assume a thinker s attitude and come to think of it we come to think The stoic s maxim according to which we should submit uncomplainingly to things which do not depend on ourselves takes into account only external misfortunes which escape our will But how to accommodate ourselves to those which come from ourselves If we are the source of our ills whom are we to confront Ourselves We manage luckily to forget that we are the guilty parties and moreover existence is tolerable only if we daily renew this lie this act of oblivion All my life I have lived with the feeling that I have been kept from my true place If the expression metaphysical exile had no meaning my existence alone would afford it one The more gifted a man is the less progress he makes on the spiritual level Talent is an obstacle to the inner life To save the word grandeur from officialdom we should use it only apropos of insomnia or heresy In classical India the sage and the saint were combined in one and the same person To have any notion of such a success we must imagine if we can a fusion between resignation and ecstasy between a cold stoic and a disheveled mystic Being is suspect Then what is to be said of life which is its deviation and stigma When someone tells us of an unfavorable opinion about ourselves instead of being distressed we should think of all the evil we have spoken of others and realize that it is only justice that as much should be said of ourselves Ironically no one is more vulnerable more susceptible and less likely to acknowledge his own defects than the backbiter Merely tell him about the slightest reservation someone has made in his regard and he will lose countenance lose his temper and drown in his own bile Seen from the outside harmony reigns in every sect clan and party seen from the inside discord Conflicts in a monastery are as frequent and as envenomed as in any society Even when they desert hell men do so only to reconstruct it elsewhere The least conversion is experienced as an advance Fortunately there exist exceptions One of my favorites is that eighteenthcentury Jewish sect in which men went over to Christianity in order to debase themselves and another is that South American Indian who upon conversion lamented that he must now become the prey of worms instead of being eaten by his children an honor he would have enjoyed had he not abjured his tribe s beliefs Only normal that man should no longer be interested in religion but in religions for only through them will he be in a position to understand the many versions of his spiritual collapse When we recapitulate the stages of our career it is humiliating to realize that we have not had the disasters we deserved the ones we were entitled to expect In some men the prospect of a more or less imminent end excites energy good or bad and plunges them into a frenzy of activity Artless enough to try to perpetuate themselves by their endeavor by their work they move heaven and earth to finish to conclude it not a moment to lose The same perspective invites others to founder in what stheuse in a stagnant clearsightedness in the unimpeachable truths of despond My curse on the man who in future editions of my works knowingly changes anything a sentence or only a word a syllable a letter a punctuation mark Is it the philosopher or the writer in Schopenhauer who speaks this way Both at once and this conjunction when we think of the awful style of any philosophical work is extremely rare It is not a Hegel who would have uttered such a curse Nor any other major philosopher except Plato Nothing more aggravating than a seamless unremitting irony which leaves you no time to breathe and still less to think which instead of being inconspicuous occasional is massive automatic at the antipodes of its essentially delicate nature Which in any case is how it is used in Germany a nation which having meditated upon it the most is least capable of wielding it Anxiety is not provoked it tries to find a justification for itself and in order to do so seizes upon anything the vilest pretexts to which it clings once it has invented them A reality which precedes its particular expressions its varieties anxiety provokes itself engenders itself it is infinite creation and as such is more likely to suggest the workings of the divinity than those of the psyche Automatic melancholy an elegiac robot At a grave the words game imposture joke dream come to mind Impossible to think that existence is a serious phenomenon Certainty of faking from the start at bottom Over the gate of our cemeteries should be written Nothing Is Tragic Everything Is Unreal I shall not soon forget the expression of horror on what was his face the dread the extreme suffering and the aggression No he was not happy Never have I seen a man so uncomfortable in his coffin Look neither ahead nor behind look into yourself with neither fear nor regret No one descends into himself so long as he remains a slave of the past or of the future Inelegant to reproach a man for his sterility when that is his postulate his mode of achievement his dream  Nights when we have slept are as if they had never been The only ones that remain in our memory are the ones when we couldn t close our eyes night means sleepless night In order not to have to resolve them I have turned all my practical difficulties into theoretical ones Faced with the Insoluble I breathe at last  To a student who wanted to know where I stood with regard to the author of Zarathustra I replied that I had long since stopped reading him Why I find him too naive  I hold his enthusiasms his fervors against him He demolished so many idols only to replace them with others a false iconoclast with adolescent aspects and a certain virginity a certain innocence inherent in his solitary s career He observed men only from a distance Had he come closer he could have neither conceived nor promulgated the superman that preposterous laughable even grotesque chimera a crotchet which could occur only to a mind without time to age to know the long serene disgust of detachment Marcus Aurelius Is much closer to me Not a moment s hesitation between the lyricism of frenzy and the prose of acceptance I find more comfort more hope even in the weary emperor than in the thundering prophet  Appealing that Hindu notion of entrusting our salvation to someone else to a chosen saint and permitting him to pray in our place to do anything in order to save us Selling our soul to God  Does talent have any need of passions Yes of many passions repressed Joubert  Not one moralist we cannot convert into a precursor of Freud It is always surprising to discover that the great mystics produced so much that they left so many treatises Undoubtedly their intention was to celebrate God and nothing else This is true in part but only in part We do not create a body of work without attaching ourselves to it without subjugating ourselves to it Writing is the least ascetic of all actions When I lie awake far into the night I am visited by my evil genius as Brutus was by his before the battle of Philippi Do I look like someone who has something to do here on earth That s what I d like to answer the busybodies who inquire into my activities It has teen said that a metaphor must be able to te drawn Whatever is original and lasting in literature for at lost a century contradicts this remark For if anything has outlived its usefulness it is coherent metaphor one with explicit contours It is against such metaphor that poetry has unceasingly rebelled to the point where a dead poetry is a poetry afflicted with coherence Listening to the weather report I feel a strong response to the words scattered rain Which certainly proves that poetry is in ourselves and not in the expression though scattered is an adjective capable of setting up a certain vibration Once I formulate a doubt or more exactly once I feel the need to formulate a doubt I experience a curious disturbing wellbeing It would be far easier for me to live without a trace of belief than without a trace of doubt Devasting doubt nourishing doubt There is no fake sensation Withdraw into yourself perceive there a silence as old as being even older  If I detest man I could not say with the same case I detest the human being for in spite of everything there is something more something enigmatic and engaging in that word being which suggests qualities alien to the idea of man In the Dhammapada it is suggested that in order to achieve deliverance we must be rid of the double yoke of Good and Evil That Good itself should be one of our fetters we are too spiritually retarded to be able to admit And so we shall not be delivered Everything turns on pain the rest is accessory even nonexistent for we remember only what hurts Painful sensations being the only real ones it is virtually useless to experience others I believe with that madman Calvin that we are predestined to salvation or damnation in our mother s womb We have already lived our life before being born A free man is one who has discerned the inanity of all points of view a liberated man is one who has drawn the consequences of such discernment We had nothing to say to one another and while I was manufacturing my phrases I felt that the earth was falling through space and that I was falling with it at a speed that made me dizzy Years and years to waken from that sleep in which the others loll then years and years to escape that awakening A task to be done something I have undertaken out of necessity or choice no sooner have I started in than everything seems important everything attracts me except that Think about those who haven t long to live who know that everything is over and done with except the time in which the thought of their end unrolls Deal with that time Write for gladiators  Erosion of our being by our infirmities the resulting void is filled by the presence of consciousness what am I saying that void is consciousness itself Moral disintegration when we spend time in a place that is too beautiful the self dissolves upon contact with paradise No doubt it was to avoid this danger that the first man made the choice he did All things considered there have teen more affirmations than negations at least till now So we may deny without remorse Beliefs will always weigh more in the scales The substance of a work is the impossible what we have not been able to attain what could not te given to us the sum of all the things which were refused us Gogol in hopes of a regeneration journeys to Nazareth and discovers he is as bored there as in a Russian railroad station this is what happens to us all when we look outside ourselves for what can exist only inside Kill yourself because you are what you are yes but not because all humanity would spit in your face Why fear the nothing in store for us when it is no different from the nothing which preceded us this argument of the Ancients against the fear of death is unacceptable as consolation Before we had the luck not to exist now we exist and it is this particle of existence hence of misfortune which dreads death Particle is not the word since each of us prefers himself to the universe at any rate considers himself equal to it When we discern the unreality of everything we ourselves become unreal we begin to survive ourselves however powerful our vitality however imperious our instincts But they are no longer anything but false instincts and false vitality If you are doomed to devour yourself nothing can keep you from it a trifle will impel you as much as a tragedy Resign yourself to erosion at all times your fate wills it so To live is to lose ground To think that so many have succeeded in dying Impossible not to resent those who write us overwhelming letters In a remote province of India everything was explained by dreams and what is more important dreams were used to cure diseases as well It was according to dreams that business was conducted and matters of life and death decided Until the English came Since then one native said We no longer dream In what we have agreed to call civilization there resides undeniably a diabolic principle man has become conscious of too late when it was no longer possible to remedy it Lucidity without the corrective of ambition leads to stagnation It is essential that the one sustain the other that the one combat the other without winning for a work for a life to be possible We cannot forgive those we have praised to the skies we are impatient to break with them to snap the most delicate chain of all the chain of admiration  not out of insolence but out of an aspiration to find our bearings to be free to be ourselves Which we manage only by an act of injustice The problem of responsibility would have a meaning only if we had been consulted before our birth and had consented to be precisely who we are The energy and virulence of my taedium vitae continue to astound me So much vigor in a disease so decrepit To this paradox I owe my present incapacity to choose my final hour For our actions for our vitality itself the claim to lucidity is as ruinous as lucidity itself Children turn and must turn against their parents and the parents can do nothing about it for they are subject to a law which decrees the relations among all the living ie that each engenders his own enemy So carefully have we been taught to cling to things that when we would be free of them we do not know how to go about it And if death did not come to our aid our stubbornness in subsisting would make us find a recipe for existence beyond wearing out beyond senility itself Everything is wonderfully clear if we admit that birth is a disastrous or at least an inopportune event but if we think otherwise we must resign ourselves to the unintelligible or else cheat like everyone else In a Gnostic work of the second century of our era we read The prayer of a melancholy man will never have the strength to rise unto God Since man prays only in despondency we may deduce that no prayer has ever reached its destination He was above all others and had had nothing to do with it he had simply forgotten to desire  In ancient China women suffering from anger or grief would climb onto platforms specially constructed for them in the street and there would give free rein to their fury or their lamentations Such confessionals should be revived and adopted the world over if only to replace the obsolete ones of the Church or the ineffectual ones of various therapeutics This philosopher lacks keeping or to use the jargon internal form He is too fabricated to be alive or even real a sinister puppet What bliss to know I shall never open his books again No one exclaims he is feeling well and that he is free yet this is what all who know this double blessing should do Nothing condemns us more than our incapacity to shout our good luck To have failed in everything always out of a love of discouragement The sole means of protecting your solitude is to offend everyone beginning with those you love A book is a postponed suicide Say what we will death is the best thing nature has found to please everyone With each of us everything vanishes everything stops forever What an advantage what an abuse Without the least effort on our part we own the universe we drag it into our own disappearance No doubt about it dying is immoral  If instead of expanding you putting you in a state of energetic euphoria your ordeals depress and embitter you you can be sure you have no spiritual vocation To live in expectation to count on the future or on a simulacrum of the future we are so accustomed to it that we have conceived the idea of immortality only out of a need to wait out eternity Every friendship is an inconspicuous drama a series of subtle wounds Luther Dead by Lucas Fortnagel A plebeian aggressive terrifying mask as of some sublime hog which perfectly renders the features of the man we cannot sufficiently praise for having declared Dreams are liars if you shit in your bed that s true The more you live the less useful it seems to have lived At twenty those nights when for hours at a time I would stand forehead pressed against the pane staring into the dark  No autocrat wields a power comparable to that enjoyed by a poor devil planning to kill himself Educating yourself not to leave traces is a momentbymomcnt war against yourself solely to prove that you could if you chose become a sage  To exist is a state as little conceivable as its contrary No still more inconceivable In Antiquity books were so costly that one could not accumulate them unless one was a king a tyrant or Aristotle the first to possess a library worthy of the name One more incriminating item in the dossier of a philosopher already so catastrophic in so many regards If I were to conform to my most intimate convictions I should cease to take any action whatever to react in any way But I am still capable of sensations  A monster however horrible secretly attracts us pursues us haunts us He represents enlarged our advantages and our miseries he proclaims us he is our standardbearer Over the centuries man has slaved to believe passing from dogma to dogma illusion to illusion and has given very little time to doubts short intervals between his epochs of blindness Indeed they were not doubts but pauses moments of respite following the fatigue of faith of any faith Innocence being the perfect state perhaps the only one it is incomprehensible that a man enjoying it should seek to leave it Yet history from its beginnings down to ourselves is only that and nothing but that I draw the curtains and I wait Actually I am not waiting for anything I am merely making myself absent Scoured if only for a few minutes of the impurities which dim and clog the mind I accede to a state of consciousness from which the self is evacuated and I am as soothed as if I were resting outside the universe In one medieval exorcism all the parts of the body even the smallest are listed from which the demon is ordered to depart a kind of lunatic anatomy treatise fascinating for its hypertrophy of precision its profusion of unexpected details A scrupulous incantation Leave the nails Fanatic but not without poetic effect For authentic poetry has nothing in common with poetry In all our dreams even if they deal with the Flood there Is always if only for a fraction of a second some minuscule Incident we witnessed the day before This regularity which I have verified for years is the only constant the only law or semblance of law I have been able to discern In night s incredible chaos The dissolving power of conversation One realizes why both meditation and action require silence The certainty of being only an accident has accompanied me on all occasions propitious or injurious and if it has saved me from the temptation to believe myself necessary it has not on the other hand entirely cured me of a certain vainglory inherent in the loss of illusions Rare to come upon a free mind and when you do you realize that the best of such a mind is not revealed in its works when we write we bear mysteriously chains but in those confidences where released from conviction and pose as from all concern with rigor or standing it displays its weaknesses And where it behaves as a heretic to itself If the foreigner is not a creator in the matter of language it is because he wants to do as well as the natives whether or not he succeeds this ambition is his downfall I begin a letter over and over again I get nowhere what to say and how to say it I don t even remember whom I was writing to Only passion or profit find at once the right tone Unfortunately detachment is indifference to language insensitivity to words Yet It is by losing contact with words that we lose contact with human beings Everyone has had at a given moment an extraordinary experience which will be for him because of the memory of it he preserves the crucial obstacle to his Inner metamorphosis I know peace only when my ambitions sleep Once they waken anxiety repossesses me Life is a state of ambition The mole digging his tunnels Is ambitious Ambition is in effect everywhere and we see its traces on the faces of the dead themselves Going to India because of the Vedanta or Buddhism is about the same as going to France because of Jansenism Moreover the latter is more recent since it vanished only three centuries ago Not the slightest trace of reality anywhere except in my sensations of unreality Existence would be a quite impracticable enterprise if we stopped granting importance to what has none Why docs the Gita rank renunciation of the fruit of actions so high Because such renunciation is rare impracticable contrary to our nature and because achieving it is destroying the man one has been and one is killing in oneself the entire past the work of millennia in a word freeing oneself of the Species that hideous and immemorial riffraff We should have abided by our larval condition dispensed with evolution remained incomplete delighting in the elemental siesta and calmly consuming ourselves in an embryonic ecstasy Truth abides in the individual drama If I suffer authentically I suffer much more than an individual I transcend the sphere of my selfhood I rejoin the essence of others The only way to proceed toward the universal is to concern ourselves exclusively with what concerns ourselves When we are fixated on doubt we take more pleasure in lavishing speculations upon it than in practicing it If you want to know a nation frequent its secondorder writers they alone reflect its true nature The others denounce or transfigure the nullity of their compatriots and neither can nor will put themselves on the same level They are suspect witnesses In my youth there would be weeks during which I never closed my eyes I lived in the unlived world I had the sense that Time with all its moments had concentrated itself within me where it culminated where it triumphed I moved it onward of course I was its promoter and bearer its cause and substance and it was as an agent and accomplice that I participated in its apotheosis When sleep departs from us the unheardof becomes everyday easy we enter it without preparations inhabit it wallow in it Astounding the number of hours I have wasted on  the meaning of what exists of what happens  But that what has no meaning as all serious minds know Hence they devote their time and their energy to more useful undertakings My affinities with Russian Byronism from Pechorin to Stavrogin my boredom and my passion for boredom X whom I do not particularly appreciate was telling a story so stupid that I wakened with a start those we don t like rarely shine in our dreams For lack of occupation the old seem to be trying to solve something very complicated devoting to it all the capacities they still possess Perhaps this is why they do not commit suicide en masse as they ought were they even a trifle less absorbed Love at its most impassioned does not bring two human beings so close together as calumny Inseparable slanderer and slandered constitute a transcendent unity forever welded one to the other Nothing can separate them One inflicts harm the other endures it but if he endures it it is because he is accustomed to doing so can no longer do without it even insists upon it He knows that his wishes will be gratified that he will never be forgotten that whatever happens he will be eternally present in the mind of his indefatigable benefactor The monkerrant the wandering friar so far the supreme achievement To reach the point of no longer having anything to renounce Such must be the dream of any disabused mind Sobbing negation the only tolerable form of negation Lucky Job who was not obliged to annotate his lamentations Late at night I feel like falling into a frenzy doing some unprecedented thing to release myself but I don t see against whom against what Mme d Heudicourt SaintSimon observes had never spoken good of anyone In her life without adding some crushing but s A wonderful definition not of backbiting but of conversation in general Everything that lives makes noise What an argument for the mineral kingdom Bach was quarrelsome litigious selfserving greedy for titles and honors etc So what A musicologist listing the cantatas whose theme is death has remarked that no mortal ever had such a nostalgia for it Which is all that counts The rest has to do with biography The misfortune of being incapable of neutral states except by reflection and effort What an idiot achieves at the outset we must struggle night and day to attain and only by fits and starts I have always lived with the vision of a host of moments marching against me Time will have been my Birnam Wood Painful or wounding questions asked by the uncouth distress and anger us and may have the same effect as certain techniques of Oriental meditation Who knows if a dense aggressive stupidity might not provoke illumination It is certainly worth as much as a rap on the head with a stick Knowledge is not possible and even if it were would solve nothing Such is the doubter s position What does he want then what is he looking for Neither he nor anyone will ever know Skepticism is the rapture of impasse Besieged by others I try to make my escape without much success it must be confessed Yet I manage to wangle myself day by day a few seconds audience with the man I would have liked to be By a certain age we should change names and hide out somewhere lost to the world in no danger of seeing friends or enemies again leading the peaceful life of an overworked malefactor We cannot reflect and be modest Once the mind is set to work it replaces God and anything else It is indiscretion encroachment profanation It does not build it dislocates The tension its methods betray reveals its brutal implacable character without a good dose of ferocity we could not follow a thought to its conclusion Most subverters visionaries and saviors have been either epileptics or dyspeptics There is unanimity as to the virtues of epilepsy gastric upheavals are regarded on the other hand as less meritorious Yet nothing is more conducive to subversion than a digestion which refuses to be forgotten My mission Is to suffer for all those who suffer without knowing it I must pay for them expiate their unconsciousness their luck to be ignorant of how unhappy they are Each time Time torments me I tell myself that one of us must back down that it is impossible for this cruel confrontation to go on indefinitely When we are in the depths of depression everything which feeds it affords it further substance also raises it to a level where we can no longer follow and thereby renders it too great excessive scarcely surprising that we should reach the point of no longer regarding it as our own A foretold misfortune when at last it occurs is ten is a hundred times harder to endure than one we did not expect All during our apprehensions we lived through it in advance and when it happens these past torments are added to the present ones and together they form a mass whose weight is intolerable Obviously God was a solution and obviously none so satisfactory will ever be found again I shall never utterly admire anyone except a man dishonored and happy There is a man I should say who defies the opinion of his fellows and who finds consolation and happiness in himself alone The man of the Rubicon after Pharsalus had forgiven too many Such magnanimity seemed offensive to those of his friends who had betrayed him and whom he had humiliated by treating them without rancor They felt diminished flouted and punished him for his clemency or for his disdain he had refused to stoop to resentment Had he behaved as a tyrant they would have spared him But they could not forgive him since he had not deigned to frighten them enough Everything that is engenders sooner or later nightmares Let us try therefore to invent something better than being Philosophy which had made it its business to undermine beliefs when it saw Christianity spreading and on the point of prevailing made common cause with paganism whose superstitions seemed preferable to the triumphant insanities By attacking and demolishing the gods philosophy had intended to free men s minds in reality it handed them over to a new servitude worse than the old one for the god who was to replace the gods had no particular weakness for either tolerance or irony Philosophy it will be objected is not responsible for the advent of this god indeed this was not the god philosophy recommended No doubt but it should have suspected that we do not subvert the gods with impunity that others would come to take their place and that it had nothing to gain by the exchange Fanaticism is the death of conversation We do not gossip with a candidate for martyrdom What are we to say to someone who refuses to penetrate our reasons and who the moment we do not bow to his would rather die than yield Give us dilettantes and sophists who at least espouse all reasons  We invest ourselves with an abusive superiority when we tell someone what we think of him and of what he does Frankness is not compatible with a delicate sentiment nor even with an ethical exigency More than all others our relatives are ready to doubt our merits It is a universal rule Buddha himself did not escape it one of his cousins opposed him the most and only afterward Mara the devil For the victim of anxiety there is no difference between success and fiasco His reaction to the one is the same as to the other both trouble him equally When I torment myself a little too much for not working I tell myself that I might just as well be dead and that then I would be working still less  Rather in a gutter than on a pedestal The advantages of a state of eternal potentiality seem to me so considerable that when I begin listing them I can t get over the fact that the transition to Being could ever have occurred Existence Torment The equation seems obvious to me but not to one of my friends How to convince him I cannot lend him my sensations yet only they would have the power to persuade him to give him that additional dose of illbeing he has so insistently asked for all this time If we see things black it is because we weigh them in the dark because thoughts are generally the fruit of sleeplessness consequently of darkness They cannot adapt to life because they have not been thought with a view to life The notion of the consequences they might involve doesn t even occur to the mind We are beyond all human calculation beyond any notion of salvation or perdition of being or nonbeing we are in a particular silence a superior modality of the void Not yet to have digested the affront of being born To expend oneself in conversations as much as an epileptic in his fits In order to conquer panic or some tenacious anxiety there is nothing like imagining your own burial An effective method readily available to all In order not to have to resort to it too often in the course of a day best to experience its benefit straight off when you get up Or else use It only at exceptional moments like Pope Innocent IX who having commissioned a painting in which he was shown on his deathbed glanced at It each time he had to make some important decision There is no negator who is not famished for some catastrophic yes We may be sure that man will never reach depths comparable to those he knew during the ages of egoistic colloquy with bis God Not one moment when I am not external to the universe No sooner have I lamented over myself pitying my wretched condition than I realize that the terms in which I described my misfortune were precisely those which define the first characteristic of the supreme being Aristotle Aquinas Hegel three enslavers of the mind The worst form of despotism is the system in philosophy and in everything God is what survives the evidence that nothing deserves to be thought When I was young no pleasure compared with the pleasure of making enemies Now whenever I make one my first thought is to be reconciled so that I won t have to bother about him Having enemies is a heavy responsibility My burden is sufficient I no longer can carry that of others as well Joy is a light which devours itself inexhaustibly it is the sun early on A few days before he died Claudel remarked that we should not call God infinite but inexhaustible As if it did not come down to the same thing or just about All the same this concern for exactitude this verbal scruple at the moment that he was writing that his lease on life had nearly expired is more inspiring than a sublime word or gesture The unusual is not a criterion Paganini is more surprising and more unpredictable than Bach We should repeat to ourselves every day I am one of the billions dragging himself across the earth s surface One and no more This banality justifies any conclusion any behavior or action debauchery chastity suicide work crime sloth or rebellion Whence it follows that each man is right to do what he does Tsimtsum This sillysounding word designates a major concept of the Cabbala For the world to exist God who was everything and everywhere consented to shrink to leave a vacant space not inhabited by Himself it is in this hole that the world occurred Thus we occupy the wasteland He conceded to us out of pity or whim For us to exist He contracted He limited His sovereignty We are the product of His voluntary reduction of His effacement of His partial absence In His madness He has actually amputated Himself for us If only He had had the good sense and the good taste to remain whole In the Gospel According to the Egyptians Jesus proclaims Men will be the victims of death so long as women give birth And he specifies I am come to destroy the works of woman When we frequent the extreme truths of the Gnostics we should like to go if possible still further to say something never said which petrifies or pulverizes history something out of a cosmic Neronianism out of a madness on the scale of matter To express an obsession is to project it outside yourself to hunt it down to exorcise it Obsessions are the demons of a world without faith Man accepts death but not the hour of his death To die any time except when one has to die Once we step into a cemetery a feeling of utter mockery does away with any metaphysical concern Those who look for mystery everywhere do not necessarily get to the bottom of things Most often mystery like the absolute corresponds only to a mannerism of the mind It is a word we should use only when we cannot do otherwise in really desperate cases If I recapitulate my plans which have remained plans and those which have worked out I have every reason to regret that these latter have not suffered the fate of the former He who is inclined to lust is merciful and tenderhearted those who are inclined to purity are not so Saint John Climacus  It took a saint neither more nor less to denounce so distinctly and so vigorously not the lies but the very essence of Christian morality and indeed of all morality We are not afraid to accept the notion of an uninterrupted sleep on the other hand an eternal awakening immortality if it were conceivable would be just that plunges us into dread Unconsciousness is a country a fatherland consciousness an exile Any profound impression is voluptuous or funereal or both at once No one has been so convinced as I of the futility of everything and no one has taken so tragically so many futile things Ishi the last American Indian of his tribe after hiding for years in terror of the White Men reduced to starvation surrendered of his own free will to the exterminators of his people believing that the same treatment was in store for himself He was made much of He had no posterity he was truly the last Once humanity is destroyed or simply extinguished we may imagine a sole survivor who would wander the earth without even having anyone to surrender to  Deep in his heart man aspires to rejoin the condition he had before consciousness History is merely the detour he takes to get there Only one thing matters learning to be the loser Every phenomenon is a corrupt version of another larger phenomenon time a disease of eternity history a disease of time life again a disease of matter Then what is normal what is healthy Eternity Which itself is only an infirmity of God  Without the notion of a failed universe the spectacle of injustice in every system would put even an abulic into a straitjacket Annihilating affords a sense of power flatters something obscure something original in us It is not by erecting but by pulverizing that we may divine the secret satisfactions of a god Whence the lure of destruction and the illusions it provokes among the frenzied of any era Each generation lives in the absolute it behaves as if it had reached the apex if not the end of history Any and every nation at a certain moment of its career considers itself chosen It is at this moment that it gives the best and the worst of itself No accident that the Trappist order was founded in France rather than in Italy or Spain Granted the Spanish and the Italians talk ceaselessly but they do not hear themselves talk whereas the Frenchman relishes his eloquence never forgets he is talking is consummately conscious of the fact He alone could regard silence as an ordeal as an askesis What spoils the French Revolution for me is that it all happens on stage that its promoters are born actors that the guillotine is merely a decor The history of France as a whole seems a bespoke history an acted history everything in it is perfect from the theatrical point of view It is a performance a series of gestures and events which are watched rather than suffered a spectacle that takes ten centuries to put on Whence the impression of frivolity which even the Terror affords seen from a distance Prosperous societies are far more fragile than the others since it remains for them to achieve only their own ruin comfort not being an ideal when we possess it still less of one when it has been around for generations Not to mention the fact that nature has not included wellbeing in her calculations and could not do so without perishing herself If all peoples turned apathetic at once there would be no more conflicts no more wars no more empires But unfortunately there are young peoples and indeed young people a major obstacle to the philanthropists dreams to bring it about that all men might reach the same degree of lassitude or ineffectualIty  We must side with the oppressed on every occasion even when they are in the wrong though without losing sight of the fact that they are molded of the same clay as their oppressors Characteristic of dying regimes to permit a confused mixture of beliefs and doctrines and to give the Illusion at the same time that the moment of choice can be indefinitely postponed This is the source the sole source of the charm of prerevolutionary periods Only false values prevail because everyone can assimilate them counterfeit them false thereby to the second degree  An idea that succeeds is necessarily a pseudoidea Revolutions are the sublime of bad literature The unfortunate thing about public misfortunes is that everyone regards himself as qualified to talk about them The right to suppress everyone that bothers us should rank first in the constitution of the ideal State The only thing the young should be taught is that there is virtually nothing to be hoped for from life One dreams of a Catalogue of Disappointments which would include all the disillusionments reserved for each and every one of us to be posted in the schools According to the Princess Palatine Mme de Maintenon was in the habit of repeating during the years after the king s death when she had no further role to play For some time now there has prevailed a spirit of vertigo which is spreading everywhere This spirit of vertigo is what the losers have always noticed correctly moreover and we might well reconsider all history from the perspective of this formula Progress is the injustice each generation commits with regard to its predecessor The surfeited hate themselves not secretly but publicly and long to be swept away one way or another They prefer in any case that the sweeping be accomplished with their own cooperation This is the most curious the most original aspect of a revolutionary situation A nation generates only one revolution The Germans have never repeated the exploit of the Reformation or rather they have repeated but not equaled it France has remained an eternal tributary of  Equally true of Russia and of all nations this tendency to plagiarize oneself in regard to revolutions is at once reassuring and distressing Romans of the decadence enjoyed only what they called Greek leisure otium graecum  the thing they had most despised in the period of their vigor The analogy with today s civilizations is so flagrant it would be indecent to insist on it Alaric claimed that a demon drove him against Rome Every exhausted civilization awaits its barbarian and every barbarian awaits his demon The West a sweetsmelling rottenness a perfumed corpse All these nations were great because they had great prejudices They now have none Are they nations still At most disintegrated crowds The white race increasingly deserves the name given by the American Indians palefaces In Europe happiness stops at Vienna Beyond misery upon misery since the beginning The Romans the Turks and the British could found lasting empires because refractory to all doctrine they imposed none upon the subject nations They would never have managed to wield so long a hegemony had they been afflicted with some messianic vice Unhopedfor oppressors administrators and parasites lords without convictions they had the art of combining authority and indifference rigor and abandon It is this art the secret of the true master which the Spaniards of old lacked as it is lacking in the conquerors of our own day So long as a nation keeps the awareness of its superiority it is fierce and respected once it loses that awareness a nation becomes humanized and no longer counts When I rage against the age I can calm myself merely by thinking of what will happen of the retrospective jealousy of those who come after us in certain respects we belong to the old humanity the humanity that could still regret paradise But those who come after us will not even have the recourse of that regret they will not even have an idea of it not even the word My vision of the future is so exact that if I had children I should strangle them here and now When we think of the Berlin salons in the Romantic period of the role played in them by a Henrietta Herz or a Rachel Levin of the friendship between the latter and Crown Prince LouisFerdinand and when we then think that if such women had lived in this century they would have died in some gas chamber we cannot help considering the belief in progress as the falsest and stupidest of superstitions Hesiod was the first to elaborate a philosophy of history And also launched the notion of decadence By doing so what a light he casts on historical process If at the very outset in the heart of the postHomeric world he decided that humanity was In its Iron age what would he have said a few centuries later what would he say today Except in periods clouded over by frivolity or Utopia man has always believed himself on the threshold of the worst Knowing what he knew by what miracle could he have unceasingly varied his desires and his terrors When just after the First World War electricity was installed in the village where I was born there was a general murmur of protest then mute desolation But when electricity was installed in the churches there were three  everyone was convinced the Antichrist had come and with him the end of time These Carpathian peasants had seen clearly had seen far Emerging from prehistory they knew already in that day and age what civilized men have known only recently It is my prejudice against everything that turns out well that has given me a taste for reading history Ideas are unsuited to a final agony they die of course but without knowing how to die whereas an event exists only with a view to its end A sufficient reason to prefer the company of historians to that of philosophers During his famous embassy to Rome in the second century bc Carneades took advantage of the occasion to speak the first day in favor of the idea of justice and on the following day against it From that moment philosophy hitherto nonexistent in that country of healthy conduct began to perpetrate its ravages What is philosophy then The worm in the fruit  Cato the Censor who had been present at the Greek s dialectical performances was alarmed by them and asked the Senate to satisfy the Athenian delegation as soon as possible so harmful and even dangerous did he consider their presence Roman youth was not to frequent minds so destructive On the moral level Carneades and his companions were as formidable as the Carthaginians on the military Rising nations fear above all the absence of prejudices and prohibitions the intellectual shamelessness which constitutes the allure of declining civilizations Hercules was punished for having succeeded in all his undertakings Similarly Troy too happy had to perish Pondering this vision shared by the tragic poets we cannot help thinking that the socalled free world upon which every fortune has been lavished will inevitably suffer Ilion s fate for the jealousy of the gods survives their disappearance The French don t want to work any more they all want to write my concierge told me unaware that she was then and there passing judgment on all old civilizations A society is doomed when it no longer has the force to be limited How with an open mind too open can it protect itself against the excesses the mortal risks of freedom Ideological disputes reach the point of paroxysm only in countries where men have fought each other over words where they have gone to death for words  in the countries in short which have known wars of religion A nation which has exhausted its mission is like an author who repeats himself no who has nothing left to say For to repeat yourself is to prove that you still believe in yourself and in what you have said But a declining nation no longer has even the strength to mouth its old mottoes which once had assured it its preeminence and its pride French has become a provincial language The natives don t mind Only the foreigner is inconsolable on its account he alone goes into mourning for Nuance  Themistocles by a unanimously approved decree had the interpreter of Xerxes ambassadors put to death for having dared use the Greek language to express the orders of a barbarian A people commits such an act only at the peak of its career It is decadent it is dying when it no longer believes in its language when it stops believing that its language is the supreme form of expression the language A nineteenthcentury philosopher maintained In his innocence that la Rochefoucauld was right for the past but that he would be invalidated by the fixture The Idea of progress dishonors the intellect The further man proceeds the less he is in a position to solve his problems and when at the apex of his blindness he will be convinced he is on the point of success then the unheardof will occur I would bestir myself at best for the Apocalypse but for a revolution To collaborate with an ending or a genesis an ultimate or initial calamity yes but not with a change for some better or worse  We have convictions only if we have studied nothing thoroughly In the long run tolerance breeds more ills than intolerance If this is true it constitutes the most serious accusation that can be made against man Once the animals no longer need to fear each other they fall into a daze and take on that dumbfounded look they have in zoos Individuals and nations would afford the same spectacle if some day they managed to live in harmony no longer trembling openly or in secret With sufficient perspective nothing is good or bad The historian who ventures to judge the past is writing journalism in another century In two hundred years let us be precise  the survivors of the overly fortunate nations will be put on reservations and visited contemplated with disgust commiseration or stupor and with a malicious admiration as well Monkeys living in groups reject apparently those which in some fashion have consorted with humans How one regrets that Swift never knew such a detail Are we to execrate our age or all ages Do we think of Buddha withdrawing from the world on account of his contemporaries If humanity has such love for saviors those fanatics who so shamelessly believe in themselves it is because humanity supposes they believe in it The strength of this Statesman is to be visionary and cynical A dreamer without scruples The worst crimes are committed out of enthusiasm a morbid state responsible for almost all public and private disasters The future appeals to you All yours Myself I prefer to keep to the incredible present and the incredible past I leave it to you to face the Incredible itself You re against everything that s been done since the last war said the very uptodate lady You ve got the wrong date I m against everything that s been done since Adam Hitler is without a doubt the most sinister character in history And the most pathetic He managed to achieve precisely the opposite of what he wanted he destroyed his ideal point by point It is for this reason that he is a monster in a class by himself that is a monster twice over for even his pathos is monstrous All great events have been set in motion by madmen by mediocre madmen Which will be true we may be sure of the end of the world itself The Zohar teaches that those who do evil on earth were no better in heaven that they were impatient to leave it and rushing to the mouth of the abyss that they arrived ahead of the time when they were to descend into this world One readily discerns the profundity of this vision of the preexistence of souls and its usefulness when we are to explain the assurance and the triumph of the wicked their solidity and their competence Having prepared their endeavors so far ahead it is not astonishing that they should possess the earth they conquered it before they were here  an eternity ago and for all eternity as a matter of fact What distinguishes the true prophet from the rest is that he stands at the origin of movements and doctrines which exclude and oppose each other In a metropolis as in a hamlet what we still love best is to watch the fall of one of our kind The appetite for destruction is so deeply anchored within us that no one manages to extirpate it It belongs to our constitution for the very basis of our being is demoniac The sage is a pacified withdrawn destroyer The others are destroyers in practice Misfortune is a passive endured state while malediction supposes an election a rebours consequently a notion of mission of inner power which is not implied in misfortune An accursed individual or nation necessarily outclasses an unfortunate individual or nation Strictly speaking history docs not repeat itself but since the illusions man is capable of are limited in number they always return in another disguise thereby giving some ultradecrepit filth a look of novelty and a tragic glaze I read some pages on Jovinian Saint Basil and several others The conflict during the first centuries of Christianity between orthodoxy and heresy seems no more insane than the one to which modern ideologies have accustomed us The modalities of the controversy the passions at work the follies and the absurdities are almost identical In both cases everything turns on the unreal and the unverifiable which form the very basis of either religious or political dogmas History would be tolerable only if we escaped both kinds True it would then cease altogether for the great good of everyone those who endure it as well as those who make it What makes destruction suspect is its facility anyone who comes along can excel in it But if to destroy is easy to destroy oneself is less so Superiority of the outcast over the agitator or the anarchist Had I lived in the early period of Christianity I too I fear would have yielded to its seduction And I hate that sympathizer that hypothetical fanatic I cannot forgive myself that conversion of two thousand years ago  Tom between violence and disillusionment I seem to myself a terrorist who going out in the street to perpetrate some outrage stops on the way to consult Ecclesiastes or Epictetus According to Hegel man will be completely free only by surrounding himself with a world entirely created by himself But this is precisely what he has done and man has never been so enchained so much a slave as now Life would become endurable only among a humanity which would no longer have any illusions in reserve a humanity completely disabused and delighted to be so Everything I have been able to feel and to think coincides with an exercise in antiutopia Man will not last Ambushed by exhaustion he will have to pay for his toooriginal career For it would be inconceivable and contra naturam that he drag on much longer and come to a good end This prospect is depressing hence likely Enlightened despotism the only regime that can attract a disabused mind one incapable of being the accomplice of revolutions since it is not even the accomplice of history Nothing more painful than two contemporary prophets One must withdraw must disappear if he is unwilling to expose himself to ridicule Unless both are thus exposed which would be the most equitable solution I am stirred even overwhelmed each time I happen upon an innocent person Where does he come from What is he after Doesn t such an apparition herald some disaster It is a very special disturbance we suffer in the presence of someone there is no way of calling our kind Wherever civilized men appeared for the first time they were regarded by the natives as devils as ghosts specters Never as living men Unequaled intuition a prophetic insight if ever there was one If everyone had seen through everything if everyone had understood history would have ceased long since But we are fundamentally biologically unsuited to understand And even if everyone understood except for one history would be perpetuated because of that one because of his blindness Because of a single illusion X maintains we are at the end of a cosmic cycle and that soon everything will fall apart And he does not doubt this for one moment At the same time he is the father of a numerous family With certitudes like his what aberration has deluded him into bringing into a doomed world one child after the next If we foresee the End if we are sure it will be coming soon if we even anticipate it better to do so alone One does not procreate on Patmos Montaigne a sage has had no posterity Rousseau an hysteric still stirs nations I like only the thinkers who have inspired no tribune of the people In  the Council of Florence decreed that pagans Jews heretics and schismatics will have no part in eternal life and that all unless they embrace before dying the true religion will go straight to hell In the days when the Church professed such enormities it was truly the Church An institution is vital and strong only if it rejects everything which is not itself Unfortunately the same is true of a nation or of a regime A serious honest mind understands and can understand nothing of history History in return is marvelously suited to delight an erudite cynic Extraordinary pleasure at the thought that being human one is born under an accursed star and that whatever one has undertaken and whatever one is going to undertake will be fondled by mischance Plotinus befriended a Roman senator who had freed his slaves renounced his wealth and who ate and slept at the houses of friends for he no longer owned anything This senator from the official point of view was deranged and his case would be regarded as distressing which indeed it was a saint in the Senate  His presence even his possibility what an omen The hordes were not far  A man who has completely vanquished selfishness who retains no trace of it whatever cannot live longer than twentyone days according to one modern Vedantist school No Western moralist not even the grimmest would have dared venture an observation on human nature so startling so revealing We invoke progress less and less and mutation more and more and all that we allege to illustrate the latter s advantages is merely one symptom after another of an unrivaled catastrophe We can breathe and brawl only in a corrupt regime But we realize as much only after having contributed to its destruction and when nothing is left but our capacity to regret it What we call the creative instinct is merely a deviation merely a perversion of our nature we have not been brought into the world in order to innovate to revolutionize but to enjoy our semblance of being in order to liquidate it quietly and to vanish afterward without a fuss The Aztecs were right to believe the gods must be appeased to offer them human blood every day in order to keep the universe from sinking back into chaos We long since ceased to believe in the gods and we no longer offer them sacrifices Yet the world is still here No doubt Only we no longer have the good luck to know why it does not collapse on the spot  We pursue whatever we pursue out of torment a need for torment Our very quest for salvation is a torment the subtlest the best camoulaged of all If it is true that by death we once more become what we were before being would it not have been tetter to abide by that pure possibility not to stir from it What use was this detour when we might have remained forever in an unrealized plenitude Once my body gives me the slip how I wonder with such carrion on my hands will I combat the capitulation of my organs The ancient gods ridiculed men envied them hunted them down on occasion harried them The God of the Gospels was less mocking and less jealous and mortal men did not even enjoy in their miseries the consolation of being able to accuse Him Which accounts for the absence or the impossibility of a Christian Aeschylus A good God has killed tragedy Zeus deserved differently of literature Haunted obsessed by abdication as far back as I can remember But abdication of what If I once longed to be someone it was only for the satisfaction of someday being able to say like Charles V at Yuste I am no longer anything Some of the Provincial Letters were rewritten as many as seventeen times Astounding that Pascal could have expended so much time and energy whose interest seems minimal to us now Every polemic dates every polemic with men In the Pensees the debate was with God This still concerns us somewhat Saint Seraphim of Sarov in his fifteen years of complete seclusion opened his cell door to no one not even to the bishop who occasionally visited the hermitage Silence he would say brings man closer to God and makes him on earth like unto the angels What the saint should have added is that silence is never deeper than in the impossibility of prayer  Modern man has lost the sense of fate and thereby the savor of lamentation In the theater we should reinstate the chorus at once and at funerals the mourners  In anxiety a man clings to whatever can reinforce can stimulate his providential discomfort to try to cure him of it is to destroy his equilibrium anxiety being the basis of his existence and his prosperity The cunning confessor knows it is necessary knows that we cannot do without anxiety once we have known it Since he dares not proclaim its benefits he employs a detour he vaunts remorse an admitted an honorable anxiety His customers are grateful hence he manages to keep them readily enough whereas his lay colleagues struggle and grovel to keep theirs You once told me death did not exist Agreed provided you add that nothing exists To grant reality to anything and to deny it to what seems so manifestly real is sheer extravagance When we have committed the folly of confiding a secret to someone the only way of being sure he will keep it to himself is to kill him on the spot Sicknesses some by day others by night in their fashion visit men bearing suffering to mortals in silence for wise Zeus has denied them speech Hesiod  Fortunately for being mute they are already excruciating what would they be if they were garrulous as well Can we imagine even one proclaiming itself Instead of symptoms declarations Zeus for once has shown signs of delicacy In periods of sterility one should hibernate sleep day and night to preserve one s strength instead of wasting it in mortification and rage We can admire someone only if he is threequarters irresponsible admiration has nothing to do with respect The not at all negligible advantage of having greatly hated men is that one comes to endure them by the exhaustion of this very hatred Once the shutters are closed I stretch out in the dark The outer world a fading murmur dissolves All that is left is myself and there s the rub Hermits have spent their lives in dialogue with what was most hidden within them If only following their example I could give myself up to that extreme exercise in which one unites with the intimacy of one s own being It is this selfinterview this inward transition which matters and which has no value unless continually renewed so that the self is finally absorbed by its essential version Even in God s company discontent was brewing as the revolt of the angels testifies the first on record Apparently on every level of creation no one is forgiven his superiority We might even conceive of an envious flower The virtues have no face Impersonal abstract conventional they wear out faster than the vices which more powerfully charged with vitality define themselves and become accentuated with age Everything is filled with gods said Thaies at the dawn of philosophy at the other end at this twilight we have come to we can proclaim not only out of a need for symmetry but even more out of respect for the evidence that everything is emptied of gods I was alone in that cemetery overlooking the village when a pregnant woman came in I left at once in order not to look at this corpsebearer at close range nor to ruminate upon the contrast between an aggressive womb and the timeworn tombs between a false promise and the end of all promises The desire to pray has nothing to do with faith It emanates from a special despondency and lasts as long even while the gods and their very memory may vanish away forever No language can hope for anything but its own defeat Gregory Palamas  So radical a condemnation of all literature could come only from a mystic from a professional of the Inexpressible In Antiquity one resorted readily especially among the philosophers to voluntary asphyxia one held one s breath until one died So elegant and yet so practical a mode of being done with it has completely disappeared and it is anything but certain it can ever reappear It has been said and said again the concept of destiny which supposes change history does not apply to an immutable being Hence we cannot speak of God s destiny Doubtless we cannot in theory In practice we do nothing but particularly in the periods when beliefs are dissolving when faith is shaky when nothing seems able to withstand time when God Himself is swept into the general deliquescence Once we begin to want we fall under the jurisdiction of the Devil Life is nothing death everything Yet there is nothing which is death independent of life It is precisely this absence of autonomous distinct reality which makes death universal it has no realm of its own it is omnipresent like everything which lacks identity limit and bearing an indecent infinitude Euphoria Incapable of articulating my habitual moods and the reflections they engender impelled by some unknown power I exulted without motive and it is just such jubilation of unknown origin I reminded myself which is the experience of those who do and strive those who produce They neither can nor will reflect on what denies them And if they did it would be of no consequence as was the case for me that memorable day Why embroider upon what excludes commentary A text explained is no longer a text We live with an idea we don t dissect it we struggle with it we don t describe the stages of the conflict The history of philosophy is the negation of philosophy A suspect scrapie led me to wonder exactly what it was by which I was fatigued and I began drawing up the list though incomplete it appeared so long and so depressing that I decided to fall back on fatigue in itself a flattering formula which thanks to its philosophical ingredient might restore a plague victim Destruction and explosion of syntax victory of ambiguity and approximation All very well But just try to draw up a will and you ll see if the defunct rigor was so contemptible An aphorism Fire without flames Understandable that no one tries to warm himself at it Even if I were to lose my reason I could never bring myself to that uninterrupted prayer advocated by the Hesychasts All I understand about piety is its excesses its suspect outrages and askesis would not interest me a moment if one did not encounter there all those things which are the lot of the bad monk indolence gluttony the thirst for desolation greed and aversion for the world vacillation between tragedy and the equivocal hope of an inner collapse  I forget which Father recommends manual labor against acedia Admirable advice which I have always followed spontaneously no depression that secular acedia can resist puttering Years now without coffee without alcohol without tobacco Luckily there is anxiety which usefully replaces the strongest stimulants The worst reproach to be made against police states is that they oblige for prudence s sake the destruction of letters and diaries ie what is least false in literature To keep the mind alert slander turns out to be as effective as disease the same vigilance the same fixed attention the same insecurity the same flagellating hysteria the same mortal enrichment I am nothing obviously but since for so long I wanted to be something I fail to smother that aspiration that will It exists because it has existed it belabors me and prevails though I reject it Try as I do to relegate it to my past it kicks up again and torments me never having been satisfied it has maintained itself Intact and has no Intention of yielding to my orders Caught between my will and myself what can I do In bis Ladder of Paradise Saint John Climacus notes that a proud monk has no need to be persecuted by the Devil he is himself his own devil I think of X whose life in the monastery was a failure No one was tetter constituted to distinguish himself in the world and to shine there Unsuited to humility to obedience he chose solitude and bogged down in it There was nothing in him to become according to the same saint s expression the lover of God Out of irony one can neither create one s own salvation nor help others create theirs one can merely disguise one s wounds if not one s distastes It is a great force and a great fortune to be able to live without any ambition whatever I aspire to it but the very fact of so aspiring still participates in ambition The blank time of meditation is in truth the only foil time We should never blush to accumulate vacant moments vacant in appearance filled in fact To meditate is a supreme leisure whose secret has been lost Noble gestures are always suspect Each time we regret having committed them Something false about them something theatrical attitudinizing It is true that we regret ignoble gestures almost as much If I reflect on any moment of my life the most feverish or the most neutral what remains and what difference is there now between them Everything having become the same without relief and without reality it is when I felt nothing that I was closest to the truth I mean to my present state in which I am recapitulating my experiences What is the use of having felt anything at all There is no ecstasy which either memory or imagination can resuscitate No one before his last moment manages to use up his death altogether even for the born moribund death has a touch of novelty According to the Cabbala God created souls at the beginning and they were all before him in the form they would later take in their incarnation Each soul when its time has come receives the order to join the body destined for it but each to no avail implores its Creator to spare it this bondage and this corruption The more I think of what could not have failed to happen when my own soul s turn came the more I realize that if there was one soul which more than the rest must have resisted incarnation it was mine We dismiss the skeptic we speak of an automatism of doubt while we never say of a believer that he has fallen into an automatism of faith Yet faith is much more mechanical than doubt which has the excuse of proceeding from surprise to surprise inside perplexity it is true That faint light in each of us which dates back to before our birth to before all births is what must be protected if we want to rejoin that remote glory from which we shall never know why we were separated I have never known a single sensation of fulfillment of true happiness without thinking that it was the moment when now or never I should disappear for good A moment comes when it seems futile to have to choose between metaphysics and amateurism between the unfathomable and the anecdote To measure accurately the decline Christianity represents in relation to paganism we need merely compare the pathetic remarks of the Church Fathers on suicide with the opinions offered on the same subject by a Pliny a Seneca and even a Cicero What is the point of what we say Is there any meaning to this series of propositions which constitutes our talk And do these propositions taken one by one have any object We can talk only if we set aside this question or if we raise it as infrequently as possible To hell with everything if these words have been uttered even only once coldly with complete awareness of what they mean history is justified and with it all of us Woe unto you when all men speak well of you Christ was here foretelling his own end All men now speak well of him even the most hardened unbelievers they above all Jesus knew perfectly well that he would one day succumb to universal approbation Christianity is lost if it does not suffer persecutions as pitiless as those it was subjected to at its beginning It must provoke enemies at all costs prepare great calamities for itself Only a new Nero might still be able to save it I believe speech to be a recent invention and find it hard to imagine a dialogue that dates back beyond ten thousand years And even harder a dialogue that will occur in not ten thousand but even a thousand years from now In a work of psychiatry only the patients remarks interest me in a work of criticism only the quotations No one can do anything for this Polish woman who is beyond sickness and health even beyond living and dying A phantom cannot be cured still less an enlightened mind We can cure only those who belong to the earth and still have their roots in it however superficial The periods of sterility we pass through coincide with an exacerbation of our discernment with the eclipse of the madman in us To proceed to the extremities of one s art and even further of one s being such is the law of any man who regards himself to any degree as chosen It is because of speech that men give the illusion of being free If they did without a word what they do we would take them for robots By speaking they deceive themselves as they deceive others because they say what they are going to do who could suspect they are not masters of their actions Deep inside each man feels and believes himself to be immortal even if he knows he will perish the next moment We can understand everything admit everything realize everything except our death even when we ponder it unremittingly and even when we are resigned to it In the slaughterhouse that morning I watched the cattle being led to their death Almost every animal at the last moment refused to move forward To make them do so a man hit them on the hind legs This scene often comes to mind when ejected from sleep I lack the strength to confront the daily torture of Time I pride myself on my capacity to perceive the transitory character of everything An odd gift which has spoiled all my joys better all my sensations Everyone expiates his first moment For an instant I think I experienced what absorption into Brahma might signify for an adept of the Vedanta How much I longed for that instant to be extensible infinitely  I sought in doubt a remedy for anxiety The remedy ended by making common cause with the disease If a doctrine spreads it is because heaven has so desired Confucius  As I should like to believe each time that faced with some victorious aberration my rage borders on apoplexy The number of fanatics extremists and degenerates I have been able to admire A relief bordering on orgasm at the notion that one will never again embrace a cause any cause An acrobat An orchestra conductor caught up by the idea He rushes in then calms down alternates the allegro with the andante a master of himself like the fakirs or the swindlers While he is talking he seems to be seeking something but one never knows what an expert in the art of counterfeiting the thinker If he were to say a single thing that was perfectly clear he would be lost Since he is as ignorant as his hearers of what he wants to say or what he wants he can go on for hours without exhausting the amazement of the puppets listening to him A privilege to live in conflict with one s times At every moment one is aware one does not think like the others This state of acute dissimilarity however indigent or sterile it appears nonetheless possesses a philosophical status which one would be at a loss to seek in cogitations attuned to events There s no help for it the nonagenarian kept repeating to whatever I said to whatever I shouted into her ear concerning the present the future the march of events  In the hope of getting some other response from her I went on with my apprehensions my grievances my complaints Obtaining only the sempiternal No help for it I came to the end of my patience and left irritated with myself irritated with her What folly to confide in an idiot Outside complete reversal But the old woman s right How could I fail to realize right away that her refrain had a truth in it doubtless the most important truth of all since everything that happens proclaims it and everything in ourselves rejects it  Two kinds of intuitions original Homer Upanishads folklore and belated Mahayana Buddhism Roman stoicism Alexandrian gnosis  First flashes and fading glows The wakening of consciousness and the lassitude of being awakened If it is true that what perishes has never existed birth source of the perishable exists as little as the rest Beware of euphemisms They aggravate the horror they are supposed to disguise To use as the French do the disappeared instead of the deceased or the dead man seems to me preposterous even insane When man forgets he is mortal he feels inclined to do great things and sometimes succeeds This oblivion fruit of excess is at the same time the cause of his woes Mortal think as a mortal Antiquity invented a tragic modesty Of all the equestrian statues of Roman emperors the only one to survive the barbarian invasions and the erosion of the ages is that of Marcus Aurelius the least emperor of all and the one who would have adapted himself to any other condition Getting up with my head full of plans I would be working I was sure of it all morning long No sooner had I sat down at my desk than the odious vile and persuasive refrain What do you expect of this world stopped me short And I returned as usual to my bed with the hope of finding some answer of going back to sleep We make choices decisions as long as we keep to the surface of things once we reach the depths we can neither choose nor decide we can do nothing but regret the surface  The fear of being deceived is the vulgar version of the quest for Truth When you know yourself well and do not despise yourself utterly it is because you are too exhausted to indulge in extreme feelings It is a withering process to follow a doctrine a belief a system for a writer especially unless he lives as often happens in contradiction with the ideas to which he appeals This contradiction or this treason stimulates him and keeps him in a state of insecurity embarrassment shame conditions favorable to production Paradise was the place where everything was known but where nothing was explained The universe before sin before commentary I have no faith luckily If I had I should live in constant fear of losing it Hence far from helping me it would do nothing but injure me An impostor a humbug conscious of being so and therefore a selfspectator is necessarily more advanced in knowledge than a steady mind full of merits and all of a piece Anyone possessing a body is entitled to be called a reprobate If he is afflicted with a soul as well there is no anathema to which he cannot lay claim How are we to speak to someone who has lost everything What language shall we use The most diffuse the vaguest will always be the most effective Supremacy of regret the actions we have not performed constitute by the very fact that they pursue us and that we continually think about them the sole contents of our consciousness Sometimes I wish I were a cannibal less for the pleasure of eating someone than for the pleasure of vomiting him No longer wanting to be a man  dreaming of another form of failure Each time you find yourself at a turningpoint the best thing is to lie down and let the hours pass Resolutions made standing up are worthless they are dictated either by pride or by fear Prone we still know these two scourges but in a more attenuated more intemporal form When someone complains that his life has come to nothing we need merely remind him that life itself is in an analogous situation if not worse Works die fragments not having lived cannot die either Horror of the accessory paralyzes me Now the accessory is the essence of communication and hence of thought  it is the flesh and blood of speech and writing Trying to renounce it is like fornicating with a skeleton The satisfaction we take from performing a task especially when we have no belief in the task and even disdain it shows to what degree we still belong to the rabble My merit is not to be totally ineffectual but to have wanted to be If I do not deny my origins it is because it is ultimately better to be nothing at all than a pretense of something A mixture of automatism and whim man is a robot with defects a robot out of order If only he remains so and is not some day put right What every man whether he has patience or not has always expected is of course death But he knows this only when death comes  when it is too late to be able to enjoy it Man certainly began praying long before he knew how to speak for the pangs he must have suffered upon leaving animality upon denying it could not have been endured without grunts and groans prefigurations premonitory signs of prayer In art and in everything the commentator is generally better informed and more lucid than the subject of commentary This is the advantage the murderer has over his victim Let us offer our thanks to the gods who keep no one in this life by force Seneca whose style according to Caligula lacks cement is open to the essential and this not so much because of his affiliation with stoicism as because of his eightyears exile in Corsica particularly desolate at the time This ordeal conferred upon a frivolous writer a dimension he would not have acquired in the normal course of events it relieved him of the aid of a sickness Mine still this moment passes by escapes me and is buried forever Am I going to commit myself with the next I make up my mind it is here it belongs to me and already is long since past From morning to night fabricating the past After having to no avail tried everything among the mystics he had only one recourse to founder in wisdom  Once you ask yourself socalled philosophical questions and employ the inevitable jargon you assume a superior aggressive manner and this in a realm where the insoluble being de rigueur humility should be also This anomaly is merely apparent the more formidable the questions you confront the more you lose your head ultimately you bestow on yourself the dimensions they possess If the pride of theologians stinks even more than that of the philosophers it is because one decs not concern oneself with God with impunity one reaches the point of arrogating to oneself certain of His attributes the worst of course At peace with itself and the world the mind atrophies It flourishes at the slightest contrariety Thought is really no more than the shameless exploitation of our embarrassments and our disgraces This body once loyal disavows me no longer follows me has ceased to be my accomplice Rejected betrayed discarded what would become of me if old infirmities to prove their allegiance didn t come to keep me company at every hour of the day and night Distinguished people do not invent in matters of language On the contrary the ones who excel there are those who improvise out of boastfulness or who wallow in a sentimental coarseness Such men are natures they live on the level of words Is verbal genius then the concomitant of low haunts In any case it requires a certain minimum of odium We should keep to a single language and deepen our knowledge of it at every opportunity For a writer gossiping with a concierge in his own is much more profitable than arguing with a scholar in a foreign tongue the feeling of being everything and the evidence of being nothing I happened across this phrase in my youth and was overwhelmed by it Everything I felt in those days and everything I would feel from then on was summed up in this eitraordinary banal formula the synthesis of expansion and failure ecstasy and impasse Most often it is not in a paradox but in a truism that a revelation appears Poetry excludes calculation and premeditation it is incompletion foreboding abyss Neither a singsong geometry nor a succession of bloodless adjectives We are too deeply wounded and too despondent too weary and too barbarous in our weariness to appreciate yet the craft We cannot do without the notion of progress yet it does not deserve our attention It is like the meaning of life Life must have one But is there any which does not turn out upon examination to be ludicrous Trees are massacred houses go up faces faces everywhere Man is spreading Man is the cancer of the earth There is something enveloping and voluptuous about the notion of fatality it keeps you warm A troglodyte that will have passed through all the nuances of satiety  The pleasure of slandering yourself greatly exceeds that of being slandered Better than anyone I know the danger of being born with a thirst for everything A poisoned gift a vengeance of Providence Thus encumbered I could get nowhere on the spiritual level of course the only one that matters Anything but accidental my failure is identified with my essence The mystics and their collected works When one addresses oneself to God and to God alone as they claim to do one should be careful not to write God doesn t read  Each time I think of the Essential I seem to glimpse it in silence or explosion in stupor or exclamation Never in speech When you meditate all day on the inopportuneness of birth everything you plan and everything you perform seems pathetic futile You are like a madman who cured does nothing but think of the crisis from which he has emerged the dream he has left behind he keeps harking back to it so that his cure is of no benefit to him whatever The appetite for torment is for some what the lure of gain is for others Man started out on the wrong foot The misadventure in Paradise was the first consequence The rest had to follow I shall never understand how we can live knowing that we are not to say the least eternal The ideal being An angel ravaged by humor When after a series of questions about desire disgust and serenity Buddha was asked What is the goal the final meaning of nirvana he did not answer He smiled There has been a great deal of commentary on that smile instead of seeing it as a normal reaction to a pointless question It is what we do when confronted by a child s why We smile because no answer is conceivable because the answer would be even more meaningless than the question Children admit no limits to anything they always want to see beyond to see what there is afterward But there is no afterward Nirvana is a limit the limit It is Iteration supreme impasse  Existence might well have had some attraction before the advent of noise let us say before the neolithic age When will he come the man who can rid us of all men For all we tell ourselves about not outliving a stillborn babe instead of clearing out at the first opportunity we cling with lunatic energy to one day more Lucidity docs not extirpate the desire to live far from it lucidity merely makes us unsuited to life God a disease we imagine we are cured of because no one dies of it nowadays Unconsciousness is the secret the vital principle of life  It is the sole recourse against the self against the disease of being individualized against the debilitating effect of the state of consciousness a state so formidable so demanding that it must be reserved for athletes alone Any success in any realm involves an inner impoverishment It makes us forget what we are it deprives us of the torment of our limits I have never taken myself for a being A noncitizen a marginal type a nothing who exists only by the excess by the superabundance of his nothingness To have foundered somewhere between the epigram and the sigh Suffering opens our eyes helps us to see what we would not have seen otherwise Hence it is useful only to knowledge and except for that serves only to poison existence Which one may add in passing favors knowledge further He has suffered hence he has understood This is all we can say of a victim of disease injustice or of any kind of misfortune Suffering improves no one except those who were already good  it is forgotten as all things are forgotten it does not enter into humanity s patrimony nor preserve itself in any way at all it wastes itself as everything is wasted Once again it serves only to open our eyes Man has said what he had to say He should rest now But refuses and though he has entered into his survivor phase he fidgets as if he were on the threshold of an astonishing career A cry means something only in a created universe If there is no creator what is the good of calling attention to yourself Nerval Having reached the Place de la Concorde my thought was to kill myself Nothing in all French literature has haunted me as much as that In everything only the beginning and the outcome matter doing and undoing The way toward being and the way out of being that is breathing whereas being as such is merely an asphyxiator With the passage of time I am convinced that my first years were a paradise But I am undoubtedly mistaken If there was ever a paradise I must look for it earlier than all my years A golden rule to leave an incomplete image of oneself The more man is man the more he loses in reality it is the price he must pay for his distinct essence If he managed to achieve the limits of his singularity if he were to become man totally absolutely there would no longer be anything in him which would suggest any kind of existence at all Silence in the face of the decrees of fate the rediscovery after centuries of thundering prayer of the ancient Be still there is our aspiration there our struggle if such a word is appropriate to a foreseen and accepted defeat Every success is ignominious we never get over it in our own eyes of course The pangs of truth about ourselves are more than we can endure How pitiable the man if such a being exists who no longer lies to himself I shall no longer read the sages they have done me too much harm I should have surrendered to my instincts let my madness flourish I have done just the opposite I have put on the mask of reason and the mask has ended by replacing my face and usurping all the rest In my moments of megalomania I tell myself that it is impossible my diagnoses should be mistaken that I have only to be patient to wait until the end until the advent of the last man the one being in a position to substantiate me  The notion that it would have been better never to exist is among those which meet with the most opposition Every man incapable of seeing himself except from inside regards himself as necessary even indispensable every man feels and perceives himself as an absolute reality as a whole as the whole The moment we identify ourselves entirely with our own being we react like God we are God It is only when we live at once within and on the margins of ourselves that we can conceive quite calmly that it would have been preferable that the accident we are should never have occurred If I followed my natural inclination I should blow up the world And it is because I lack the courage to follow it that out of penitence I try to stupefy myself with the company of those who have found peace A writer has left his mark on us not because we have read him a great deal but because we have thought of him more than is warranted I have not frequented Baudelaire or Pascal particularly but I have not stopped thinking of their miseries which have accompanied me everywhere as faithfully as my own At each age more or less distinct signs warn us that it is time to decamp We hesitate we procrastinate convinced that once old age has come at last these signs will become so clear that any further vacillation would be unsuitable Clear they are indeed but we lack sufficient vigor to perform the one decent action a living man can commit Our physiological miseries help us to envisage the future with some confidence they dispense us from tormenting ourselves overmuch they do their test so that none of our longrange projects has time to wear out all our available energies The Empire was falling the Barbarians were on the move  What was to be done except to escape the age Happy moment when there was still somewhere to go when the empty places were accessible and welcoming We have been dispossessed of everything even the desert For the man who has got in the nasty habit of unmasking appearances event and misunderstanding are synonyms To make for the essential is to throw up the game to admit one is defeated X is undoubtedly right to compare himself to a volcano but wrong to go into details The poor by thinking unceasingly of money reach the point of losing the spiritual advantages of nonpossession thereby sinking as low as the rich The early Greeks regarded the psyche as no more than air wind or at test smoke and one readily agrees with them every time one wearies of foraging in one s own ego or that of others searching for strange and if possible suspect depths The final step toward indifference is the destruction of the very notion of indifference Walking in a forest between two hedges of ferns transfigured by autumn that is a triumph What are ovations and applause beside it To deprecate your own kind to vilify and pulverize them to attack their foundations to undermine your very basis to destroy your point of departure to punish your origins  to curse all those nonelect lesser breeds torn between imposture and elegy whose sole mission is not to have one Having destroyed all my connections burned my bridges I should feel a certain freedom and in fact I do one so intense I am afraid to rejoice in it When the habit of seeing things as they are turns into a mania we lament the madman we have been and are no longer  Someone we regard highly comes closer to us when he performs an action unworthy of him thereby he releases us from the calvary of veneration And starting from that moment we feel a true attachment to him Nothing is worse than the coarseness and meanness we perpetrate out of timidity Faced with the Nile and the Pyramids Flaubert thought of nothing but Normandy according to one witness nothing but the landscapes and manners of the future Madame Bovary Nothing but that seemed to exist for him To imagine is to limit oneself to exclude without an excessive capacity for rejection no plan no work no way of realizing anything What in any way resembles a victory seems to me so dishonorable that i can do battle in whatever circumstance only with the firm intention of gaining the under hand I have passed the stage where beings matter and I see no reason to struggle in known worlds Philosophy is taught only in the agora in a garden or at home The lecture chair is the grave of philosophy the death of any living thought the dais is the mind in mourning That I can still desire proves that I lack an exact perception of reality that I am distracted that I am a thousand miles from the Truth Man we read in the Dhammapada is prey to desire only because he does not see things as they are I was shaking with rage my honor was at stake The hours passed dawn was approaching Was I going to ruin my night because of a trifle Try as I would to minimize the incident the reasons I invented to calm myself remained ineffectual That anyone would dare do such a thing to me I was on the point of opening the window and screaming like a madman when the image of our planet spinning like a top suddenly seized my mind My anger subsided at once Death is not altogether useless after all it is because of death that we may be able to recuperate the prenatal space our only space  How right it was to begin the day as men once did with a prayer a call for help Ignorant of whom to address ourselves to we will end by groveling before the first cracked god to come along Acute consciousness of having a body that is the absence of health  Which is as much as to say that I have never been well Everything is deception I ve always known that Yet this certitude has afforded me no relief except at the moments when it was violently present to my mind  The perception of the Precarious raised to the level of vision of mystical experience The only way of enduring one disaster after the next is to love the very idea of disaster if we succeed there are no further surprises we are superior to whatever occurs we are invincible victims In very powerful sensations of pain much more than in very slight ones we observe ourselves we divide into an external witness and the moaning screaming sufferer Everything which borders on torment wakens the psychologist in each of us as well as the experimenter we want to see how fer we can go in the intolerable What is injustice compared to disease True we may find it unjust to be sick Moreover that is how each of us reacts without troubling as to whether he is right or wrong Sickness is nothing more real than disease If we call it unjust we must dare to do as much with Being itself we must speak then of the injustice of existing The Creation as it was amounted to little enough tinkered with it was worth still less If only it had teen left to Its truth Its primal nullity The Messiah to come the real one is understandably slow about putting in an appearance The task that awaits him is not going to te an easy one how will he manage to deliver humanity from the mania of amelioration When getting too used to ourselves we begin to loathe ourselves we soon realize that we are worse off that self hatred actually strengthens self attachment I do not interrupt him I let him weigh each man s merits waiting for him to tell me off  His Incomprehension of others is astounding Subtle and ingenuous both he judges you as if you were an entity or a category Time having had no hold over him he cannot admit that I am outside of whatever he forbids that nothing of what he favors still concerns me Dialogue becomes pointless with someone who escapes the procession of the years I ask those I love to be kind enough to grow old Panic in the face of anything of presence of the void of anything Original panic God is even if He isn t D is incapable of assimilating Evil He acknowledges its existence but cannot incorporate it into his mind If he were to emerge from hell he would be oblivious of his whereabouts so remote is he in his thinking from what falls afoul  Not the faintest trace of all he has endured in his ideas Occasionally he has reflexes no more than that the reflexes of a wounded man Closed to the negative he does not discern that all we possess is merely a capital of nonbeing Yet more than one of his gestures reveals a demonic spirit demonic unawares He is a destroyer obscured and sterilized by Good Curiosity to measure our progress into failure is the only reason we have to grow older Wc thought we had reached the limit we thought the horizon was blocked forever we lamented in the thrall of our discouragement And now we realize that we can fall still lower that there is something new that all hope is not lost that it is possible to sink a little further and thus to postpone the danger of getting stuck even paralyzed  Life seems good only to the madman observed Hegesias a Cyrcnaic philosopher some twentythree centuries ago These are almost the only words of his we have  Of all oeuvres to reinvent his comes first on my list No one approaches the condition of a sage if he has not had the good luck to be forgotten in his lifetime To think is to undermine to undermine oneself Action involves fewer risks for it fills the interval between things and ourselves whereas reflection dangerously widens it So long as I give myself up to physical exercise manual labor I am happy fulfilled once I stop I am seized by dizziness and I can think of nothing but giving up for good At the lowest point of ourselves when we touch bottom and feel the abyss we are suddenly raised up defensereaction or absurd pride by the sense of being superior to God The grandiose and impure aspect of the temptation to be done with it all A broadcast about wolves with recordings of their howls What a language The most heartrending I know and I shall never forget it From now on in moments of excessive solitude I need merely recall those sounds to have the sense of belonging to a community From the moment defeat was in sight Hitler spoke of nothing but victory He believed in it he behaved in any case as if he believed in it and remained to the end walled up in his optimism his faith Everything was crumbling around him every day belied his hopes but persisting in his trust in the impossible blinding himself as only the incurable can he had the strength to go on to the end to invent one horror after the next and to continue beyond his madness even beyond his destiny Which is why we can say of him of the man who failed so utterly that he realized himself better than any other mortal Apra moi le deluge is the unavowed motto of every person if we admit that others survive us it is in the hope that they will be punished for it A zoologist who observed gorillas in their native habitat was amazed by the uniformity of their life and their vast idleness Hours and hours without doing anything Was boredom unknown to them This is indeed a question raised by a human a busy ape Far from fleeing monotony animals crave it and what they most dread is to see it end For it ends only to be replaced by fear the cause of all activity Inaction is divine yet it is against inaction that man has rebelled Man alone in nature is incapable of enduring monotony man alone wants something to happen at all costs something anything  Thereby he shows himself unworthy of his ancestor the need for novelty is the characteristic of an alienated gorilla We come closer and closer to the Unbreathable When we have reached it that will be the great Day Alas we are only on the eve A nation achieves and retains preeminence as long as it accepts conventions which are necessarily clumsy as long as it is given over to prejudices without regarding them as such Once it calls them by their name everything is unmasked everything is compromised To seek to rule to take a role to make the law such things cannot be done without a powerful dose of stupidity history in its essence is stupid It continues it advances because the nations liquidate their prejudices one after the other If they were to be rid of them all at the same time there would be nothing left but a blessed universal disintegration One cannot live without motives I have no motives left and I am living I was in perfect health I felt better than ever Suddenly I was cold so cold that I was sure there was no cure for it What was happening to me Yet this was not the first time I had been in the grip of such a sensation But in the past I had endured it without trying to understand This time I wanted to know and now I abandoned one hypothesis after the next it could not be sickness not the shadow of a symptom to cling to What was I to do I was baffled incapable of finding even the trace of an explanation when an idea occurred to me and this was a real relief that what I was feeling was merely a version of the great final cold that it was simply death exercising rehearsing  In paradise objects and beings assaulted by light from all sides cast no shadow Which is to say that they lack reality like anything that is unbroached by darkness and deserted by death Our first intuitions are the true ones What I thought of so many things in my first youth seems to me Increasingly right and after so many detours and distractions I now come back to it aggrieved that I could have erected my existence on the ruin of those revelations I remember a place I have been only if I have had the luck to experience utter misery there At the street fair watching a tumbler grimacing shouting exhausting himself I told myself that he was doing his duty whereas I was evading mine  To manifest oneself to produce in any realm is the characteristic of a more or less camouflaged fanatic If we do not regard ourselves as entrusted with a mission existence is difficult action impossible The certitude that there is no salvation is a form of salvation in fact it is salvation Starting from here we might organize our own life as well as construct a philosophy of history the insoluble as solution as the only way out  My weaknesses have spoiled my existence but it is thanks to them that I exist that I imagine I exist Man interests me only since he has ceased to believe in himself While he was in his ascending phase he deserved no more than indifference Now he provokes a new sentiment a special sympathy compassionate horror For all the superstitions and shackles I have rid myself of I cannot regard myself as a free man remote from everything A mania for desistance having survived the other passions refuses to leave me it torments me it perseveres it demands that I continue renouncing withdrawing But from what What is left to reject I ponder the question My role is over my career finished and yet nothing has changed in my life I am at the same point in it I must still desist still and forever  No position is so false as having understood and still remaining alive When we consider coldly that portion of duration granted to each of us it seems equally satisfactory and equally ludicrous whether it lasts a day or a century I ve had my time no expression can be uttered more appropriately at any moment of life including the first Death is the providence of those who will have had the taste and the talent for fiasco the recompense of all who have come to nothing who wanted not to  It warrants them it is their way of winning On the other hand for the others those who have labored to succeed and who have succeeded what a denial what a slap in the face An Egyptian monk after fifteen years of complete solitude received a packet of letters from his family and friends He did not open them he flung them into the fire in order to escape the assault of memory We cannot sustain communion with oursclf and our thoughts if we allow ghosts to appear to prevail The desert signifies not so much a new life as the death of the past at last we have escaped our own history In society no less than in the Thebaid the letters we write and those we receive testify to the fact that we are in chains that we have broken none of the bonds that we are merely slaves and deserve to be so A little patience and the moment will come when nothing more will be possible when humanity thrown back on itself cannot take a single step in any direction Though we may manage a general sense of this unprecedented spectacle we should like details And we are afraid we will miss the festivities not being young enough to have the luck to attend Whether it is spoken by a grocer or a philosopher the word being apparently so rich so tempting so charged with significance in fact means nothing at all incredible that a man in his right mind can use it on any occasion whatever Getting up in the middle of the night I walked around my room with the certainty of being chosen and criminal a double privilege natural to the sleepless revolting or incomprehensible for the captives of daytime logic It is not given to everyone to have had an unhappy childhood Mine was much more than happy it was crowned I cannot find a better adjective to designate what was triumphant about even its pangs That had to be paid for that could not go unpunished If I am so fond of Dostoevsky s correspondence It Is because he speaks in it of nothing but sickness and money the only burning subjects All the rest is merely flourishes and chaff In five hundred thousand years it appears that England will be entirely submerged If I were an Englishman I should lay down my arms at once Each of us has his unit of time For one it is the day the week the month or the year for another it is a decade or a century  These units still on the human scale are compatible with any plan any task There are some however who take time itself for their unit and sometimes raise themselves above it for them what task what plan deserves to be taken seriously A man who sees too far who is contemporary with the whole future can no longer act or even move  An obsession with the precarious accompanies me in every circumstance mailing a letter this morning I told myself it was addressed to a mortal One absolute experience apropos of anything and you seem in your own eyes a survivor I have always lived with the awareness of the impossibility of living And what has made existence endurable to me is my curiosity as to howl would get from one minute one day one year to the next The first condition for becoming a saint is to love bores to endure visits  To shake people up to wake them from their sleep while knowing you are committing a crime and that it would te a thousand times tetter to leave them alone since when they wake too you have nothing to offer them  PortRoyal In that green vale so many conflicts and lacerations on account of a few bagatelles Any belief after a certain time seems gratuitous and incomprehensible as does the counterbelief which has destroyed it Only the stupefaction which both provoke remains A poor wretch who feels time who is its victim its martyr who experiences nothing else who is time at each moment knows what a metaphysician or a poet divines only by grace of a collapse or a miracle Those inner rumblings which come to nothing and by which we are reduced to the state of a grotesque volcano Each time I am gripped by a fit of rage I begin by being aggrieved and disgusted then I teil myself what luck what a windfall I am still alive I am still one of those fleshandblood ghosts There was no end to the telegram I had just received All my pretentions all my inadequacies were in it Certain failings I myself scarcely suspected were revealed were proclaimed What prescience and what detail At the end of the interminable indictment no clue no trace that permitted me to identify the sender Who could it be And why this haste this unaccustomed means of communication Who ever spoke his mind with such rigor in his grievance Where did he come from this omniscient judge who dared not name himself this coward in possession of all my secrets this inquisitor who allowed no extenuating circumstances not even the ones granted by the most hardened torturers I too might have made a misstep or two I too am entitled to some indulgence I cringe before the inventory of my defects I choke I cannot bear this procession of truths  Cursed telegram I tear it up and awaken  To have opinions is inevitable is natural to have convictions is less so Each time I meet someone who has convictions I wonder what intellectual vice what flaw has caused him to acquire such a thing However legitimate this question my habit of raising it spoils the pleasure of conversation for me gives me a bad conscience makes me hateful in my own eyes Once upon a time writing seemed important to me Of all my superstitions this one seems the most compromising and the most incomprehensible I have abused the word disgust But what other can I use to indicate a state in which exasperation is continually corrected by lassitude and lassitude by exasperation All evening having tried to define him we reviewed all the euphemisms which allow us not to pronounce in his regard the word perfidy He is not perfidious he is merely tortuous diabolically tortuous and at the same time innocent naive even angelic Imagine if you can a mixture of Aliosha and Smerdyakov When you no longer believe in yourself you stop producing or struggling you even stop raising questions or answering them whereas it is the contrary which should have occurred since it is precisely at this moment that being free of all bonds you are likely to grasp the truth discern what is real and what is not But once your belief in your own role or your own lot has dried up you become incurious about everything else even the truth though you are closer to it than ever before In Paradise I would not last a season or even a day then how account for my nostalgia for it I don t account for it it has inhabited me always it was part of me before I was Anyone may now and then have the sense of occupying only a point and a moment to have such a sense day and night hour by hour is less frequent and it is from this experience this datum that one turns toward nirvana or sarcasm or toward both at once Although I have sworn never to sin against blessed concision I am still in complicity with words and if I am seduced by silence I dare not enter it I merely prowl on its peripheries We should establish a religion s degree of truth according to what it makes of the Devil the more eminent the rank it accords him the more it testifies that it is concerned with reality that it rejects deceit and lies that it is serious that it sets more store by verification than by distraction or consolation Nothing deserves to be undone doubtless because nothing deserved to be done Hence we become detached from everything from the original as well as from the ultimate from advent as well as from collapse We know we feel that everything has been said that there is nothing left to say But we feel less that this truth affords language a strange even unsettling status which redeems it Words are ultimately saved because they have ceased living The enormous good and the enormous harm I have drawn from my ruminations on the condition of the dead The undeniable advantage of growing old is to be able to observe at close range the slow and methodical degradation of our organs they are all beginning to go some obviously others discreetly They become detached from the body as the body becomes detached from us it escapes us flees us no longer belongs to us It is a traitor we cannot even denounce since it stops nowhere and puts itself in no one s service I never tire of reading about the hermits preferably about those said to be weary of seeking God I am dazzled by the failures of the Desert If somehow Rimbaud had been able to go on as likely as imagining the day after the apocalypse or a Nietzsche scribbling away after Ecce Homo  he would have ended by reining in calming down by glossing his own explosions explicating them and himself A sacrilege in every case excess of consciousness being only a form of profanation I have followed only one idea all the way the idea that everything man achieves necessarily turns against him The idea is not a new one but I have lived it with a power of conviction a desperation which no fanaticism no delirium has ever approached There is no martyrdom no dishonor I would not suffer for it and I would exchange it for no other truth no other revelation To go still further than Buddha to raise oneself above nirvana to learn to do without it  to be stopped by nothing not even by the notion of deliverance regarding it as a mere waystation an embarrassment an eclipse My weakness for doomed dynasties for decaying empires for the Montezumas of forever for those who believe in signs for the lacerated and pursued for the drunkards of the ineluctable for the jeopardized the devoured for all who are waiting for their executioner I pass without stopping at the grave of that critic whose vitriolic remarks I have so often pondered Nor at the grave of the poet who spent his life dreaming of his ultimate dissolution Other names pursue me alien names linked to a pitiless and pacifying wisdom to a vision calculated to free the mind from all obsessions even funereal ones Nagarjuna Chandrakirti Santideva unparalleled swashbucklers dialecticians belabored by the obsession of salvation acrobats and apostles of Vacuity for whom sages among the sages the universe was only a word  No matter how many autumns I observe the spectacle of these leaves so eager to fall it still surprises me each time a surprise in which a chill down the spine would prevail were it not for the lastminute explosion of a gaiety whose origin I cannot account for There are certain moments when remote as we are from any faith we can conceive of only God as our interlocutor To address ourselves elsewhere seems an impossibility a madness Solitude in its extreme reaches requires a form of conversation also extreme Man gives off a special odor of all the animals he alone smells of the corpse The hours would not pass dawn seemed remote inconceivable Actually it was not dawn I was waiting for but oblivion of those refractory hours which refused to stir Lucky the man condemned to death I told myself who on the eve of his execution is at least sure of having one good night Will I be able to stand another minute will I collapse If there is one interesting sensation it is the one which gives us the foretaste of epilepsy A man who survives himself despises himself without acknowledging as much sometimes without even knowing as much When you live past the age of rebellion and you still rebel you seem to yourself a kind of senile Lucifer If we did not tear the stigmata of life how easy it would be to steal away and how well everything would go by itself Better than anyone I am able to forgive on the spot My desire for revenge comes late too late when memory of the offense is fading and when the incitation to action having become virtually nonexistent I have only one recourse to deplore my good feelings Only to the degree that our moments afford us some contact with death do we have some chance to glimpse on what insanity all existence is based Ultimately it is entirely a matter of indifference whether we are something even if we are God On this with a little pressure almost everyone might be brought to agree But how does it happen then that everyone aspires to further life to additional being and that there is no one who strives to sink to descend toward the ideal default According to a belief rather widespread among certain tribes the dead speak the same language as the living except that for them words have a meaning contrary to the one they had large means small near far black white  Does dying come down to that Still better than any funereal invention this complete reversal of language indicates what is unwonted dumbfounding about death  I am perfectly willing to believe in man s future but how is one to manage it when still after all in possession of one s faculties It would take their virtually complete collapse and even then  A thought which is not secretly stamped by fatality is interchangeable worthless is merely thought  In Turin at the beginning of his madness Nietzsche would rush to his mirror look at himself turn away look again In the train that was taking him to Basel the one thing he always asked for was a mirror He no longer knew who he was kept looking for himself and this man so eager to protect his identity so thirsty for himself had no instrument at hand but the clumsiest the most lamentable of expedients No one more useless and more unusable than I a datum I must quite simply accept without taking any pride in the fact whatever So long as this is not the case the consciousness of my usclessness will serve for nothing Whatever the nightmare one takes a role in it one is the protagonist one is something It is at night that the disinherited man triumphs If we were to suppress bad dreams there would be mass revolutions Terror of the future is always grafted onto the desire to experience that terror Suddenly I was alone with I felt that afternoon of my childhood that a very serious event had just occurred It was my first awakening the first indication the premonitory sign of consciousness Before that I had been only a being From that moment I was more and less than that Each begins with a rift and a revelation Birth and chain are synonyms To see the light of day to see shackles To say Everything is illusory is to court illusion to accord it a high degree of reality the highest in fact whereas on the contrary one wanted to discredit it The solution To stop proclaiming or denouncing it serving it by thinking about it The very idea that disqualifies all ideas is a fetter If we could sleep twentyfour hours a day we would soon return to the primordial slime the beatitude of that perfect torpor before Genesis the dream of every consciousness sick of itself Not to be born is undoubtedly the best plan of all Unfortunately it is within no one s reach No one has loved this world more than I and yet if it had been offered to me even as a child on a platter I should have shrieked Too late too late What s wrong what s the matter with you Nothing nothing s the matter I ve merely taken a leap outside my fate and now I don t know where to turn what to run for  We like to imagine that poets die poetic deaths One thinks of Shelley who after having reportedly seen his doppelganger drowned off the coast of Tuscany while sailing out to sea in his boat the Don Juan Or Nietzsche the mad philosopher and iconoclast who suddenly collapses in Turin while witnessing the flogging of a horse his tearleaden arms thrown around the animal s neck In the s an emaciated elderly man with sharp eyes and wavy hair is found sitting on the side of the street somewhere in Paris s Latin Quarter He is lost He can recall neither the way back home nor even his address He is taken home Eventually he stops eating After an accidental fall he is brought to a hospital He drifts in and out of lucidity rarely recognizing those closest to him He stops speaking entirely After slipping into a coma Emil Cioran dies on June   For Cioran the twilight philosopher who once noted the stillborn are the most free the end came not with melodramatic fair but gradually and quietly though it was no less tragic For several years the Romanianborn writer had been grappling with Alzheimer s Writing became more and more difficult Traveling lectures and interviews were impractical Even a walk out the door took on an almost absurd risk But Cioran s final silence was in a way a long time coming By the early s he was finding it more and more difficult to write though the themes of his writing pessimism despair melancholy and a certain ecstatic antagonism towards the world these continued to find their way into his increasingly sparse work Now well into his seventies he and Simone Boue continued to live in their Rue de l Odeon apartment where he divided his time between long walks in the Jardin du Luxembourg where he and Samuel Beckett would often cross paths and writing aphorisms in the cheap multicolored Joseph Gibert notebooks he had been using for years and that piled up on his desk in the hazy light of his topfloor writing alcove The present volume is a hybrid of Cioran s last two major publications In  the solitary stroller who once wrote Solitude so fulfilling that the merest rendezvous is a crucifixion published a book about friends and colleagues entitled Exercices d admiration It collected short articles written between the s and the s some of them are about writers with whom Cioran had longstanding friendships Samuel Beckett Mircea Eliade Henri Michaux  while others were about writers with whom he shared a certain temperament Jorge Luis Borges F Scott Fitzgerald Paul Valery  There are lesserknown names too the Spanish philosopher Maria Zambrano the Italian journalist Guido Ceronetti and the RomanianJewish poet Benjamin Fondane The list is highly eclectic and situational and between each essay Cioran s tone varies widely Sometimes his writing becomes a hymn that sings the praise of an author sometimes it takes on a personal even autobiographical form and sometimes the writing is cagey and contentious often Cioran s tone will encompass all of these at once Of Beckett for instance Cioran has this to say He lives not in time but parallel to it which is why it has never occurred to me to ask him what he thinks of events Of Borges he writes The misfortune of being recognized has befallen him He deserved better He deserved to remain in obscurity in the Imperceptible to remain as ineffable and unpopular as nuance itself Exercices d admiration is accompanied here by another quite different book Struggling with the gradual loss of his memory in  Cioran publishes Aveux et anathemes which could be translated as Confessions and Curses  a short book of aphorisms on the persistence of time memory and mortality Composed of short staccato fragments the writing has all the urgency of a last word and yet the almost tranquil distance of a documentarian How age simplifies everything At the library I ask for four books Two are set in type that is too small I discard them without even considering their contents The third too  serious seems unreadable to me I carry off the fourth without conviction Following the publication of Aveux et anathemes Cioran decides to stop writing altogether But it is a gesture already in his mind early on In a  letter to a friend he notes Even the idea of writing makes me queasy and with it comes disgust failure and a complete lack of satisfaction that not daring to admit this to itself turns sour True to form Cioran s final writings were the result of a lived contradiction A hermit singing the praises of others an amnesiac obsessed with the persistence of memory and time Circumstance or chance has deprived Cioran of the romantic death all that remains is writing that leads to its own silence But if there is a poetic image of the later Cioran perhaps this is it In any book governed by the Fragment truths and whims

more than a few pages    The subject it is true scarcely warrants prolixity Applying the same treatment to a poet and a thinker strikes me as a lapse in taste There are realms from which philosophers ought to abstain To dissect a poem as if it were a system is a crime even a sacrilege Oddly enough the poets exult when they do not understand the pronouncements made upon them The jargon flatters them gives them the illusion of preferment Such weakness demeans them to the level of their glossators To Buddhism indeed to the Orient in general  Nothingness does not have the rather grim

When such authorities designate our ruler by name who is entitled to disinherited status Man is free save for his depths On the surface he does as he likes down there will is a meaningless syllable To

the young Remizov by Ilya Repin When I knew him Remizov was eightysix years old he lived in a virtually empty apartment his concierge wanted for her daughter and schemed to evict him from on the pretext that the place was a plaguespot a rat s nest The man Pasternak considered the greatest Russian stylist had come to that The contrast between the wretched withered old man long forgotten by the world and the image of the brilliant youth in front of me robbed me of any desire to visit the rest of the exhibition The Ancients mistrusted success because they feared not only the gods jealousy but even more the danger of an inner imbalance linked to any success as such To have understood this jeopardy how far beyond us they were Impossible to spend sleepless nights and accomplish anything if in my youth my parents had not financed my insomnias I should surely have killed myself In  SainteBeuve wrote that youth was turning away from le mal romantique in order to dream like the SaintSimonians

belated revenge Fragments fugitive thoughts you say Can you call them fugitive when you are dealing with obsessions with thoughts whose precise quality is not to flee I had just written a very temperate very correct note to someone who scarcely deserved it Before sending it I added a few allusions vaguely tinged with gall And then just when I was putting the thing in the mailbox I felt myself clutched by rage and along with it by a disdain for my noble impulse for my regrettable fit of distinction Picpus Cemetery A young man and a lady past her prime The caretaker explains that this cemetery is reserved for descendants of those who were guillotined The lady blurts out But that s who we are With what an expression After all she might have been telling the truth Yet that provocative tone immediately put me on the executioner s side Opening Meister Eckhart s Sermons I read that suffering is intolerable to one who suffers for himself but light to one who suffers for God because it is God who bears the burden though it be heavy with the suffering of all mankind It is no accident that I have come across this passage for it perfectly applies to one who can never relieve himself of all that weighs upon him According to the kabbala God permits His splendor to diminish so that men and angels can endure it which comes down to saying that the Creation coincides with an impoverishment of the divine lumen an effort toward darkness to which the Creator has assented The hypothesis of God s deliberate obscuration has the merit of making us accessible to our own shadows responsible for our irreceptivity to a certain light The ideal to be able to repeat oneself like    Bach Immense supernatural aridity as if I were beginning a second existence on another planet where

whistling Religions like the ideologies that have inherited their vices are reduced to crusades against humor Every philosopher Ive ever known without exception was impulsive This flaw of the West has

abroad there being a need apparently for my vacillations The skepticonduty of a decaying world My habitation I shall never know True one has no better knowledge of where God resides for what is the sense of the expression to reside in oneself for those of us who lack any basis both in and outside ourselves I abuse the word God I use it often too often I employ it each time I touch an extremity and need a word to designate what comes after I prefer God to the Inconceivable One work of piety declares that the inability to take sides is a sign one is not enlightened by the divine light In other words irresolution that total objectivity is the road to perdition I infallibly discern a flaw in all those who are interested in the same things as myself    To have read through a work on old age solely because the author s photograph led me to do so That mixture of rictus and entreaty and that expression of grimacing stupor what hype what an endorsement This world was not created according to the will of Life it is said in the Ginza a Gnostic text of a Mandaean sect in Mesopotamia Remember this whenever you have no better argument to neutralize a disappointment After so many years after a whole life I saw her again Why are you crying I asked her immediately I m not she answered And indeed she was not crying she was smiling at me but age having distorted her features joy

destinies that can be regarded as fulfilled are obstructed ones We should bother our friends only for our burial And even then    Boredom with a bad reputation for frivolity nonetheless allows us to

than to see the man whom one esteems most in the world taking such extended interest in your miseries Few infirmities would not yield to such solicitude Let us recall that the master had every quality of a founder of a sect though disguised as a man of science If he achieved cures it was less by method than by faith Old age is the most unexpected thing of all that happens to man notes Trotsky a few years before his end If as a young man he had had the exact visceral intuition of this truth what a miserable revolutionary he would have made Noble deeds are possible only in periods when selfirony is not yet rife It was his lot to fulfill himself only halfway Everything in him was truncated his way of life like his way of thinking A man of fragments himself a fragment Dreams by abolishing time abolish death The deceased take advantage of them in order to importune us Last night there was my father He was just as I have always known him yet I had a moment s hesitation Suppose it wasn t my father We embraced in the Rumanian manner but as always with him without effusion without warmth without the demonstrativeness customary in an expansive people It was because of that sober icy kiss that I knew it was indeed my father I woke up realizing that one resuscitates only as an intruder as a dreamspoiler and that such distressing immortality is the only kind there is Punctuality a kind of pathology of scruple To be on time I would be capable of committing a crime Above the preSocratics one is occasionally inclined to set those heresiarchs whose works were mutilated or destroyed and who survive only in a few fragments of speech as mysterious as one could wish for Why after performing a good deed does one long to follow a flag any flag Generous impulses involve a certain danger they make one lose one s head unless one is generous precisely because one has lost one s head already generosity being a patent form of intoxication Each time the future seems conceivable to me I have the impression of having been visited by Grace If only it were possible to identify that vice of fabrication whose trace the universe so visibly bears I am always amazed to see how lively normal and unassailable low feelings are When you experience them you feel cheered restored to the community on equal footing with your kind If man so readily forgets he is accursed it is because he has always been so Criticism is a misconception we must read not to understand others but to understand ourselves A man who sees himself as he is stands higher than a man who raises the dead according to a saint Not knowing oneself is the universal law and no one transgresses it with impunity The truth is that no one has the courage to transgress it which accounts for the saint s exaggeration It is easier to imitate Jupiter than LaoTse Keeping up is the mark of a fluctuating mind that pursues nothing personal that is unsuited to obsession that continual impasse The eminent ecclesiastic sneered at Original Sin That sin is your livelihood Without it you would starve to death for your ministry would have no further meaning If man has not fallen since his origins why has Christ come To redeem whom and what To my objections his sole response was a condescending smile A religion is finished when only its adversaries strive to preserve its integrity The Germans do not see that it is absurd to put a Pascal and a Heidegger in the same bag The abyss yawns between a Schicksal and a Beruf between a destiny and a profession A sudden silence in the middle of a conversation suddenly brings us back to essentials it reveals how dearly we must pay for the invention of speech To have nothing more in common with men than the fact of being a man A sensation must have fallen very low to deign to turn into an idea Believing in God dispenses one from believing in anything else which is an estimable advantage I have always envied those who believed in Him though to believe oneself God seems easier to me than believing in God A word once dissected no longer signifies anything is nothing Like a body that after the autopsy is less than a corpse Each desire provokes in me a counterdesire so that

thirst keeps me from exposing my pact with breathing To lose sleep and to change language two ordeals one not dependent on oneself the other deliberate Alone face to face with the nights and with words The healthy are not real They have everything except being which is uniquely conferred by uncertain health Of all the ancients Epicurus may have been best at disdaining the mob one more reason for celebrating him What a notion to place a clown like Diogenes in so lofty a niche It is the Garden in question I should have haunted and not the marketplace nor a fortiori the tub    Yet Epicurus himself has disappointed me more than once does he not call Theognis of Megara a fool for proclaiming it was better not to be born or once born to pass as soon as possible through the gates of Hades If I were assigned to classify human miseries writes the young Tocqueville I should do so in this order sickness death doubt Doubt as scourge I could never have put forth such an opinion but I understand it as well as if I had uttered it myself in another life The end of humanity will come when everyone is like me I declared one day in a fit I have no right to identify No sooner does the door close behind me than I exclaim What perfection in the parody of hell It is for the gods to come to me not for me to go to them Plotinus answered his disciple Amelius who had sought to take him to a religious ceremony In whom in the Christian world could we find a like quality of pride You had to let him talk on talk about everything and try to isolate the dazzling things that escaped him It

posthumous teteatete between impassioned ghosts At SaintSeverin listening to the organist play the Art of the Fugue I kept saying to myself over and over There is the refutation of all my anathemas  Joseph de Maistre An Essay on Reactionary Thought AMONG THINKERS such as Nietzsche or Saint Paul with the appetite and the genius for provocation Joseph de Maistre occupies a place anything but negligible Raising the most trivial problem to the level of paradox and the dignity of scandal brandishing anathemas with enthusiastic cruelty he created an oeuvre rich in enormities a system that unfailingly seduces and exasperates The scope and eloquence of his umbrage the passion he devoted to indefensible causes his tenacity in legitimizing one injustice after another and his predilection for the deadly epithet make of him that immoderate disputant who not deigning to persuade the adversary crushes him with an adjective straight off His convictions have an appearance of great firmness he managed to overpower the solicitations of skepticism by the arrogance of his prejudices by the dogmatic vehemence of his contempt Toward the end of the last century at the height of the liberal illusion it was possible to indulge in the luxury of calling him the prophet of the past of regarding him as a relic or an aberrant phenomenon But we in a somewhat more disabused epoch know he is one of us precisely to the degree that he was a monster it is in fact by the odious aspect of his doctrines that he lives for us that he is our contemporary Even if he were obsolete moreover he would still belong to that family of minds which date incorruptibly We must envy his luck his privilege of disconcerting both admirers and detractors of obliging either party to wonder did he really produce an apology for the executioner and for war or merely confine himself to acknowledging their necessity In his indictment of PortRoyal did he express what he really thought or simply yield to a momentary impulse Where does the theoretician leave off and the partisan begin Was he a cynic an enthusiast or merely an aesthete who strayed into Catholicism To sustain the ambiguity to confound us with convictions as clearcut as his this was certainly a tour de force Inevitably readers began to question the authenticity of his fanaticism to note the restrictions he himself set upon the brutality of his remarks and insistently to cite his rare complicities with common sense We ourselves shall not insult him by supposing him tepid What attracts us is his pride his marvelous insolence his lack of equity of proportion and occasionally of decency If he did not constantly irritate us would we still have the patience to read him The truths of which he made himself an apostle amount to something only by the impassioned distortion his temperament infected upon them He transfigured the insipidities of the catechism and imparted to ecclesiastical commonplaces a flavor of extravagance Religions die for lack of paradox he knew this or felt it and in order to save Christianity he contrived to inject it with a little more spice a little more horror Here he was aided much more by his talent as a writer than by his piety which in the opinion of Madame Swetchine who knew him well lacked any warmth whatever Infatuated with corrosive expression how could he stoop to the flabby phrases of the missal A pamphleteer at prayer Conceivable though hardly attractive Humility a virtue alien to his nature he pretends to only when he remembers that he must react as a Christian Some of his exegetes have impugned not without regret his sincerity whereas they ought to have relished the uneasiness he inspired without his contradictions without the misunderstandings that he either by instinct or by design created about himself his case would have been dismissed long since his career been closed and his work suffered the misfortune of being understood the worst fate that can befall an author A fusion of the acrimonious and the elegant in his genius and in his style evokes the image of an Old Testament prophet and of a man of the eighteenth century In him inspiration and irony are no longer irreconcilable he allows us to share by his rages and his repartee in the encounter of space and intimacy infinity and the salon But while he venerated the Bible to the point of admiring indiscriminately its treasures and its trivialities he thoroughly hated the Encyclopedie though he was attached to it by the form of his intelligence and the quality of his prose Imbued with a bracing rage his books are never boring In them we see him paragraph by paragraph immoderately exalt or disparage an idea an event an institution adopting toward them the tone of a prosecutor or of a thurifer Any Frenchman who is a friend to the Jansenists is a fool or a Jansenist Everything in the French Revolution is miraculously bad The greatest enemy of Europe a foe to be crushed by all means short of crime the deadly cancer lodged in all sovereignties and unremittingly feeding on them the son of pride the father of anarchy the universal dissolvent is Protestantism In the first place there is nothing so just so learned so incorruptible as the great Spanish tribunals and if to this general character we add that of the Catholic priesthood we shall be convinced before any experience that in all the universe there can be nothing more peaceful more circumspect more humane by nature than the tribunal of the Inquisition Ignorant of the practice of excess we could learn it from de Maistre who is as likely to compromise what he loves as what he loathes A hoard of panegyrics an avalanche of dithyrambic arguments his book Du Pape somewhat disconcerted the Sovereign Pontiff who realized the danger of such an apology There is only one way to praise to inspire fear in the figure being extolled to compel him in fear and trembling to hide himself far away from the statue being erected to constrain him by generous hyperbole to measure his mediocrity and suffer from it What is an argument for the defense that neither torments nor troubles what is a eulogy that fails to kill Every apology should be a murder by enthusiasm There exists no great character that does not tend to some exaggeration de Maistre writes doubtless thinking of himself We may note that the decisive and often frenzied tone of his works is not to be discerned in his letters these caused amazement when they were published who could have suspected such amenity in the raging doctrinaire The reaction of surprise which was unanimous strikes us as a trifle naive After all a thinker generally puts his madness into his works and keeps his common sense for his ordinary relations he will always be more pitiless and unbridled when he attacks a theory than when he must address a friend or an acquaintance Intimacy with an idea incites to delirium obliterates judgment and produces the illusion of omnipotence In truth the teteatete with ideas generates madness deprives the mind of its equilibrium and pride of its composure Our excesses and our aberrations derive from our combat with unrealities with abstractions from our will to triumph over what does not exist whence the impure tyrannical wandering aspect of philosophical works moreover of any work at all The thinker blackening a page without recipient believes feels himself to be the arbiter of the world Yet in his letters he expresses on the contrary his hopes his weaknesses his defeats he attenuates the audacities of his books and rests from his excesses De Maistre s correspondence was that of a moderate man Some delighted to find a different writer quickly classified him among the liberals forgetting that he was tolerant in his life only because he was anything but in his works where the best pages are precisely those in which he magnifies the abuses of the Church and the rigors of the State Had it not been for the Revolution which wresting him from his habitual preoccupations indeed crushing him awakened him to the great problems he would have lived in Chambery the life of a good paterfamilias and a good Freemason continuing to dose his Catholicism his royalism and his Martinism with that tincture of Rousseauist phraseology which mars his early writings The French army invading Savoy drove him out he took the road of exile thereby his mind profited and his style as well as we discover when we compare his Considerations sur la France with the declamatory and diffuse productions antedating the revolutionary period Disaster clarifying his prejudices and his tastes saved him from vagueness while rendering him forever incapable of serenity and objectivity virtues rare in the emigre De Maistre was one of these and precisely during those years   when he served as the King of Sardinia s ambassador to St Petersburg All his thoughts were to bear the mark of exile There is only violence in the universe but we are deceived by modern philosophy which asserts that all is for the best whereas the worst has corrupted everything and in a very real sense all is for the worst since nothing is where it belongs Nothing is where it belongs the refrain of all emigrations and also the point of departure for all philosophical reflection The mind wakens upon contact with disorder and injustice whatever is where it belongs whatever is normal leaves the mind indifferent benumbed while frustration and dispossession enhance and animate it A thinker is enriched by all that escapes him all that is taken from him if he should happen to lose his country what a windfall Thus the exile is a thinker in miniature or a circumstantial visionary tossed between hope and fear on the lookout for events he longs for or dreads If he has genius he rises above them like de Maistre and interprets them The first condition of a decreed revolution is that everything that might have forestalled it does not exist and that those who seek to prevent it must fail entirely But order is never more apparent Providence is never more palpable than when a higher action takes man s place and operates in and of itself this is what we are seeing at this moment In periods when we become aware of the nullity of our initiatives we identify destiny either with Providence a reassuring disguise for fatality a camouflage of failure an admission of our impotence to organize the future yet a desire to discern its essential contours and determine their meaning or with a mechanical impersonal play of forces the automatism of which controls our actions and even our beliefs Yet we invest this play of forces however impersonal and mechanical with a glamour that its very definition forbids and we relate it a conversion of concepts into universal agents to a moral power responsible for events and the turn they must take At the height of positivism did we not invoke in mystical terms a Future to which we attributed an energy scarcely less effective than that of Providence Inveterately there slips into our explanations a wisp of theology inherent in even indispensable to our thought insofar as it undertakes to provide a coherent image of the world To attribute a meaning to the historical process even one derived from a logic immanent to the future is to subscribe more or less explicitly to a form of Providence Bossuet Hegel and Marx by the very fact that they assign a meaning to events belong to the same family or at least do not essentially differ from each other the important thing being not to define or determine this meaning but to resort to it to postulate it and they resort to it they postulate it To turn from a theological or metaphysical conception to historical materialism is simply to change providentialisms Were we in the habit of looking beyond the specific content of ideologies and doctrines we should see that to claim kinship with one of them rather than some other does not at all imply much expenditure of sagacity Those following one party imagine they differ from those following another whereas all once they choose join each other underneath participate in one and the same nature and vary only in appearance by the mask they assume It is folly to imagine that truth resides in choice when any adoption of a position is equivalent to a contempt for truth To our misfortune choice positiontaking is a fatality no one escapes each of us must opt for a nonreality an error obligatory fanatics that we are sick men fever victims our assents our adherences are so many alarming symptoms Whoever identifies himself with anything gives evidence of morbid dispositions no salvation and no health outside of pure being as pure as the Void But let us return to Providence a subject scarcely less vague To discover how seriously a historical period was stricken the dimensions of the disaster it was obliged to suffer simply measure the desperation with which believers justified the designs the program and the behavior of the divinity Not at all surprising that de Maistre s crucial work Les Soirees de SaintPetersbourg should be a variation on the theme of the temporal government of Providence did he not live in a time when making his contemporaries discern the effects of divine goodness required the combined resources of sophistry faith and illusion In the fifth century in a Gaul ravaged by barbarian invasions Salvianus writing De Gubernatione Dei had faced a similar task desperate combat against the evidence mission without an object intellectual effort based on hallucination    Justification by Providence is the quixotism of theology Dependent though it is on various historical moments a sensibility to fate is nonetheless conditioned by the nature of the individual Whoever engages in important enterprises knows himself to be at the mercy of a reality that is beyond him Only frivolous minds only the irresponsible believe they act freely the rest at the heart of an essential experience are rarely free from the obsession of necessity or of their star Rulers are administrators of Providence observes SaintMartin elsewhere Friedrich Meinecke remarks that in Hegel s system heroes figure as no more than functionaries of Absolute Spirit An analogous sentiment led de Maistre to call the leaders of the Revolution merely automata instruments villains who far from governing events on the contrary submitted to their course As for these automata these instruments how were they more culpable than the higher power that had provoked them and whose decrees they were so faithfully executing Would that power not be equally villanous  Since it represented for de Maistre the only fixed point in the midst of the revolutionary whirlwind he does not indict it or at least he behaves as if he accepted its sovereignty without argument In his mind it would in fact intervene only at moments of disturbance and would vanish during periods of calm so that he implicitly identifies it with a temporal phenomenon with a circumstantial Providence useful in explaining catastrophes superfluous in the intervals between them and when passions die down For us it is fully justified only if manifest everywhere and always only if it keeps permanent vigil What was such a power doing before  Was it sleeping Was it not at its post throughout the eighteenth century and did it not want anything to do with that century which de Maistre despite his theory of divine intervention makes chiefly responsible for the advent of the guillotine For him such a power assumes a content becomes truly Providence starting from a miracle from the Revolution    that in the dead of winter a man should command a tree in the presence of a thousand witnesses suddenly to cover itself with leaves and fruit and that the tree should obey everyone will acclaim as a miracle and hail the thaumaturge But the French Revolution and all that is happening at this moment is quite as wondrous in its way as the instantaneous fructification of a tree in the month of January Facing a force that performs such marvels the believer will wonder how to safeguard his freedom how to avoid the temptation of quietism and the more serious one of fatalism Such difficulties raised early in the Considerations the author attempts to evade by subtleties or by equivocation We are all attached to the throne of the Supreme Being by a supple chain that binds but does not enslave us What is admirable in the universal order of things is the action of free beings under the divine hand Freely enslaved they function at once by will and by necessity they really do as they wish but without being able to upset the general plan A supple chain slaves who act freely these are incompatibilities that betray the thinker s embarrassment over the impossibility of reconciling divine omnipotence and human freedom And it is doubtless in order to save that freedom to leave it a wider field of action that he postulates the withdrawal of divine intervention in moments of equilibrium brief intervals indeed for Providence reluctant to remain long in eclipse emerges from its repose only to strike to manifest its severity War will be its department in which it permits man to act only in a virtually mechanical fashion since successes in this realm depend almost entirely upon what depends least upon him War will therefore be divine a law of the world divine above all in the way it breaks out At the very moment occasioned by men and prescribed by justice God advances to avenge the iniquity that the inhabitants of the world have committed against Him Divine there is no adjective de Maistre uses more readily Constitution sovereignty hereditary monarchy and papacy are all according to him divine institutions as is any authority consolidated by tradition any order whose origins data back to a remote period the rest is all wretched usurpation hence human work In short divine relates to the body of institutions and phenomena execrated by liberal thought Applied to war the adjective seems at first glance unfortunate replace it with irrational and it is no longer so This kind of substitution if made in many of de Maistre s observations would attenuate their scandalous character but by resorting to it do we not ultimately dilute a thought whose virulence constitutes its charm The fact remains that to name and invoke God at every moment to associate Him with the horrible has something about it that sends chills down the spine of any balanced reticent and reasonable believer contrary to the fanatic the real believer who relishes the divinity s bloodthirsty escapades Divine or not war as it is treated in the Soirees does not fail to exert a certain fascination upon us This ceases to be true when it obsesses a secondorder mind such as de Maistre s Spanish disciple Donoso Cortes War God s work is good as all His works are good but a war can be disastrous and unjust because it is the work of man s free will I have never been able to understand those who anathematize war Such anathema is contrary to philosophy and to religion those who pronounce it are neither philosophers nor Christians The master s thought already established in an extreme position scarcely tolerates the additional exaggeration afforded by the pupil Bad causes require talent or temperament The disciple by definition possesses neither In de Maistre aggression is inspiration hyperbole innate knowledge Carried to extremes he dreams of nothing better than taking us with him And so he manages to reconcile us to war as he reconciles us to the executioner s solitude if not to the executioner himself Christian by persuasion rather than by sentiment quite alien to the figures of the New Testament he secretly loves the pomp of intolerance and it suits him to be intractable is is for nothing that he grasped so thoroughly the spirit of the Revolution And would he have managed to describe its vices had he not recognized them in himself As an enemy of the Terror and one never opposes with impunity an events an epoch or an idea he would have to combat it by steeping himself in it assimilating it His religious experience would be marked thereby the obsession with blood prevails Hence he is more attracted by the old God the God of hosts than by Christ whom he always mentions in conventional sublime phrases and usually to justify the theory interesting though no more than that of the reversibility of the sufferings of the innocent to the advantage of the guilty Moreover the only Christ who might have suited him is the figure of Spanish sculpture sanguinolent disfigured convulsive and pleased to the point of delirium by His crucifixion By packing God off outside of the world and human affairs by dispossessing Him of the virtues and faculties that would have allowed Him to make His presence and His authority felt the deists had reduced Him to the level of an idea and a symbol an abstract figuration of goodness and wisdom After a century of philosophy the point was to restore His ancient privileges the status of tyrant that had been stripped from Him so pitilessly Good correct He had ceased to be fearsome losing all empire over men s minds an enormous danger of which de Maistre was more conscious than any of his contemporaries and which he could rout only by insisting on the reestablishment of the true God the terrible one We understand nothing about religions if we suppose that man flees a capricious wicked and even ferocious divinity or if we forget that he loves fear to the point of frenzy The problem of Evil actually troubles only a few sensitive souls a few skeptics repelled by the way in which the believer comes to terms with it or spirits it away Hence it is to these that theodicies are primarily addressed attempts to humanize God frantic acrobatics that collapse and compromise themselves on this ground constantly belied as they are by experience Try as they will to be persuasive they fail they are declared suspect incriminated and asked for accountings in the name of one piece of evidence Evil evidence that a de Maistre will attempt to deny Everything is Evil he instructs us yet Evil he hastens to add comes down to a purely negative force that has nothing in common with existence comes down to a schism in being to an accident Others will assert on the contrary that quite as constitutive of being as Good and quite as real Evil is nature an essential ingredient of existence and anything but an accessory phenomenon and that the problems Evil raises become insoluble as soon as we refuse to introduce it into the composition of the divine substance Just as sickness is not an absence of health but a reality as positive and as lasting as health in the same way Evil is worth as much as Good even exceeds it in indestructibility and plenitude Good and Evil principles coexist and mingle in God as they coexist and mingle in the world The notion of God s culpability is not a gratuitous one but necessary and perfectly compatible with the notion of His omnipotence only such an idea confers some intelligibility on the historical process on all it contains that is monstrous mad and absurd To attribute goodness and purity to the creator of becoming is to abandon all comprehension of the majority of events especially the most important one the Creation God could not avoid the influence of Evil mainspring of actions an agent indispensable to Whoever exasperated by selfcontainment aspires to emerge to spread Himself and corrupt Himself in time If Evil the secret of our dynamism were to withdraw from our lives we should vegetate in that monotonous perfection of the Good which according to Genesis vexed Being itself The combat between the two principles Good and Evil is waged on every level of existence including eternity We are plunged into the adventure of the Creation one of the most dreadful of exploits without moral purposes and perhaps without meaning and though the idea and the initiative for it are God s we cannot reproach him for it so great in our eyes is His prestige as the first guilty party By making us His accomplices He associated us with that vast movement of solidarity in Evil which sustains and affirms the universal confusion No doubt de Maistre would not participate in a doctrine grounded in reason to this degree does he not propose to lend some verisimilitude to so audacious a theory as that of a divinity essentially and uniquely good A difficult even an unrealizable enterprise which he hopes to bring off by overwhelming human nature    no man is punished as just but always as a man so that it is untrue to say that virtue suffers in this world it is human nature that suffers and that always deserves to do so How can we require of the just man that he separate his quality as a man from his quality as just No innocent person will go so far as to assert I am suffering as a man not as a good man To propose such a dissociation is to commit a psychological error is to be deceived as to the meaning of Job s rebellion and not to understand that the plaguestricken man yielded to God less out of conviction than out of weariness Nothing permits us to regard goodness as the major attribute of the divinity De Maistre himself sometimes seems tempted to think as much What is an injustice of God with regard to man Do you suppose there is some common legislator above God who has prescribed how He must act toward man And what will be the nature of such a judge between Him and ourselves The more terrible God seems to us the more we must redouble our religious fear of Him the more ardent and indefatigable our prayers must become for there is no vindication that His goodness will suffice And he adds in one of the most significant passages of the Soirees these indiscreet considerations Since the proof of God precedes that of His attributes we know that He is before knowing what He is Thus we find ourselves in an empire whose sovereign has published once and for all the laws that rule the world These laws are in general marked with the striking signs of wisdom and even of goodness yet some I suppose seem harsh even unjust whereupon I ask all the malcontents what should be done Depart from the empire perhaps Impossible it is everywhere and nothing is outside it Complain sulk write against the sovereign Only to be thrashed or put to death There is no better side to take than that of resignation and respect I may even say of love for since we start from the supposition that the Master exists and that He must absolutely be served is it not better whatever He be to serve Him with love than without love An unhopedfor avowal that would have delighted a Voltaire Providence is unmasked denounced rendered suspect by the very man who had put himself forward to celebrate its goodness its honorable character Admirable sincerity the dangers of which de Maistre must have understood Subsequently he will forget himself less and less and as usual returning the focus to man will abandon the inculpation of God by rebellion jeers or despair The better to reproach human nature for the evils it endures he will forget that eminently untenable theory of the moral origin of diseases If there were no moral evil upon earth there would be no physical evil    all suffering is a torment imposed for some crime present or original if I have made no distinction among diseases it is because they are all punishments This doctrine he derives from that of Original Sin without which he tells us one explains nothing But he is mistaken when he reduces Sin to a primitive transgression to a concerted and immemorial fault instead of seeing in it a flaw a vice of nature he is also mistaken when after speaking correctly of an original disease he attributes it to our iniquities whereas it is like Sin inscribed in our very essence primordial disorder calamity affecting good and wicked virtuous and vicious alike As long as he confines himself to describing the ills that overwhelm us de Maistre is veracious he strays from truth when he tries to explain and justify their distribution on earth His observations seem to us exact his theories and his value judgments inhuman and erroneous If as he likes to think diseases are punishments then the hospitals are crammed with monsters and the incurable are by far the greatest criminals in existence Let us not take apologetics to its ultimate position let us show some indulgence with regard to those who eager to disinculpate God to put Him above suspicion reserve to man alone the honor of having conceived Evil    Like all great ideas that of the Fall accounts for everything and for nothings and it is quite as difficult to utilize as it is to do without But finally whether the Fall can be imputed to a fault or a fatality to an action of moral order or to a metaphysical principle the fact remains that it explains at least in part our erring ways our inconclusiveness our fruitless quests the terrible singularity of beings the role of disturber of brokendown and inventive animal that was assigned to each of us And if it involves a number of points subject to caution there is one however whose importance is incontestable the one that traces our failure to our separation from the All It could not escape de Maistre The more one examines the universe the more one is inclined to believe that Evil proceeds from a certain division that cannot be explained and that the return to Good depends on a contrary force that ceaselessly impels us toward a unity just as inconceivable How to explain such division Attribute it to the insinuation of Becoming within Being To the infiltration of movement into the primordial unity To a fatal shock given to the happy indistinction before there was time Who knows What seems certain is that history proceeds from a broken identity from an initial laceration source of the multiple source of Evil The notion of Sin associated with that of division satisfies the mind only if used with caution instead of in de Maistre s fashion for he quite arbitrarily proceeds to imagine a secondorder Original Sin responsible he says for the existence of the savage that descendant of a man detached from the great tree of civilization by an ordinary prevarication a fallen being who cannot be regarded without reading the anathema written I am not saying merely in his soul but even upon the external form of his body stricken in the last depths of his moral essence not at all like primitive man for with our intelligence our morality our sciences and our arts we are precisely to primitive man what the savage is to us And our author quick to hurl himself to the extremities of an idea maintains that the state of civilization and of knowledge in a certain sense is the natural and primitive state of man that the first humans marvelous beings having begun with a knowledge higher than ours perceived the effects in the causes and found themselves in possession of precious communications dispensed by beings of a higher order and that moreover certain peoples refractory to our mode of thought seem still to preserve the memory of primitive knowledge and of the era of intuition Thus we find civilization placed before history This idolatry of beginnings of a paradise already realized this obsession with origins is the very sign of reactionary or if one prefers traditional thought We can certainly conceive of an era of intuition yet only on condition that we do not identify it with civilization itself which in a break with the mode of intuitive knowledge supposes complex relations between being and knowing as well as man s inaptitude for emerging from his own categories a civilized person being by definition alien to essence to the simultaneous perception of the immediate and the ultimate It is playing with words to speak of a perfect civilization before the appearance of the conditions capable of making any civilization possible we abusively enlarge the concept of civilization if we include the golden age within it History according to de Maistre will bring us back by the detour of Evil and Sin to the unity of the paradisal age to the perfect civilization to the secrets of primitive knowledge What those secrets consisted of we shall not be so indiscreet as to ask him he has declared them impenetrable the prerogative of marvelous men no less impenetrable than they De Maistre never offers a hypothesis without immediately treating it with all the considerations due to certainty how could he doubt the existence of an immemorial knowledge when without it he could not explain to us the very first of all our catastrophes The punishments being proportional to the guilty party s knowledge the Flood he assures us presupposes unheardof crimes and these crimes presuppose in their turn knowledge infinitely superior to that which we possess A lovely and improbable theory comparable to the one about savages of which these are the terms A leader of a people having diluted the moral principle among them by a number of those prevarications which to all appearances are no longer possible in the present state of affairs because we fortunately no longer know enough to become guilty to this degree this leader then transmitted the anathema to his posterity and any constant force being by its nature accelerative since it continually adds to itself such degradation weighing continually upon the descendants has ultimately made them into what we call savages No clue as to the nature of this prevarication We shall know little more about it when we are told that it is imputable to an Original Sin of the second order Is it not too convenient in order to whitewash Providence to ascribe to the creature alone the anomalies which abound on earth If man is degraded in principle his degradation like that of the savage cannot have begun with a sin committed at a given moment by a prevarication invented by and large to consolidate a system and sustain a cause both highly dubious The doctrine of the Fall makes a powerful appeal to reactionaries of whatever stripe the most hardened and the most lucid among them know moreover what recourse it offers against the glamour of revolutionary optimism does it not postulate the invariability of human nature irremediably doomed to corruption and collapse Consequently there is no way out no solution to the conflicts that desolate societies nor any possibility of a radical change that might modify their structure history identical time context for the monotonous process of our degradation Invariably the reactionary that conservative who has dropped the mask will borrow the worst of traditional wisdom and the most profound the conception of the irreparable the static vision of the world All wisdom and a fortiori all metaphysics are reactionary as becomes any form of thought that seeking constants emancipates itself from the superstition of the diverse and the possible Contradiction in terms a revolutionary sage or a revolutionary metaphysician At a certain degree of attachment and clearsightedness history has no further value man himself ceases to count to break with appearances is to vanquish action and the illusions deriving from it When you stress the essential misery of beings you do not stop at the one that results from social inequalities nor do you strive to remedy them Can we imagine a revolution drawing its slogans from Pascal Often the reactionary is merely a cunning an interested sage who politically exploiting the great metaphysical truths examines without weakness or pity the underside of the human phenomenon in order to broadcast its horror a profiteer of the terrible whose thought paralyzed by calculation or by an excess of lucidity minimizes or calumniates time More generous being more naive  revolutionary thought on the other hand associating the erosion of Becoming with the notion of substantiality discerns in succession a principle of enrichment a fruitful dislocation of identity and monotony and a sort of continuous perfectibility A challenge hurled at the notion of Original Sin such is the ultimate meaning of revolutions Before liquidating the established order they seek to release man from the worship of origins to which religion condemns him they do so only by undermining the gods by weakening their power over men s minds For it is the gods who by binding us to a world before history make us scorn Becoming that fetish of all innovator from the simple grumbler to the anarchist Our political conceptions are dictated to us by our sentiment or our vision of time If eternity haunts us what do we care about the changes taking place in the life of institutions or of peoples To be interested in them we must believe with the revolutionary spirit that time contains the potential answer to all questions and the remedy to all evils that its unfolding involves the elucidation of mystery and the reduction of our perplexities that time is the agent of a total metamorphosis But here is the most curious thing of all the revolutionary idolizes Becoming only up to the instauration of the order for which he fought subsequently for him appears the ideal conclusion of time the Forever of Utopias an extratemporal unique and infinite moment provoked by the advent of a new age entirely different from the others an eternity here on earth that closes and crowns the historical process The notion of a golden age the notion of paradise pursues believers and unbelievers alike However between the primordial paradise of religions and the ultimate one of utopias there is the interval separating regret from hope remorse from illusion perfection achieved from perfection unrealized On which side effectiveness and dynamism may be found we realize readily enough the more specifically a moment is marked by the Utopian spirit which can very well assume a scientific disguise  the more chances it has of triumphing and of lasting As the fortune of Marxism testifies one always wins on the level of action by placing the absolute within the possible not at the beginning but at the end of time Like all reactionaries de Maistre situated it in the past The adjective satanic which he applied to the French Revolution he might just as well have extended to all events his hatred of any innovation is equivalent to a hatred of movement as such What he wants is to nail men to tradition to deflect them from their need to question the value and the legitimacy of dogmas and institutions If He has placed certain objects beyond the limits of our vision it is doubtless because it would be dangerous for us to perceive them clearly I daresay what we should not know is more important than what we should know Positing that without the inviolability of mystery order collapses de Maistre counters the indiscretions of the critical spirit with the bans of orthodoxy the multiplication of heresies the rigor of a unique truth But he goes too far he begins raving when he seeks to convince us that any metaphysical proposition that does notselfevidently emerge from a Christian dogma is and can only be a culpable extravagance A fanatic of obedience he accuses the Revolution of having laid bare the basis of authority and of having revealed its secret to the uninitiated to the mob If you give a child one of those toys which perform movements inexplicable to him by means of an internal mechanism after having played with it for a moment he will break it to see what s inside It is thus that the French have treated their government They have wanted to see inside they have laid bare the political principles they have opened the mob s eyes to objects that it had never occurred to them to examine without realizing that there are things that are destroyed by being shown Remarks of an insolent an aggressive lucidity which might be made by the representative of any regime of any party Yet no liberal nor any man of the left would ever dare to adopt them Must authority to maintain itself rest upon some mystery some irrational foundation The right says as much the left denies it A purely ideological difference in fact any order that seeks to last succeeds in doing so only by surrounding itself with a certain obscurity by flinging a veil over its motives and its actions by generating an aura of the sacred that renders it impenetrable to the masses This is an obvious fact that the democratic governments cannot adopt but that on the other hand is proclaimed by the reactionaries who unconcerned by public opinion and the consent of the crowd shamelessly offer unpopular truisms inopportune banalities By these the democrats are scandalized though they know that reaction often translates their hidden thoughts that it expresses certain of their innermost disappointments many bitter certitudes of which they can give no public account Committed to their generous program they may not parade the slightest contempt for the people nor even for human nature not having the right or the luck to invoke Original Sin they must cajole and flatter man must seek to liberate him optimists sick at hearty anguished amid their fervors and their dreams at once swept away and paralyzed by a uselessly noble uselessly pure idea How many times in their heart of hearts must they not envy the doctrinal offhandedness of their enemies The leftist s despair is to do battle in the name of principles that forbid him cynicism Such torment was spared a de Maistre who dreading above all things the liberation of the individual was careful to found authority on bases solid enough to resist the dissolving principles promulgated by the Reformation and the Encyclopedie The better to affirm the notion of order he will attempt to minimize the share of premeditation and of will in the creation of laws and institutions he will deny that languages themselves have been invented while conceding that they may have begun nonetheless speech precedes man for he adds it is only possible by the Word The political meaning of such a doctrine is revealed to us by Bonald in the Discours preliminare of his Legislation primitive If the human race has received speech it has necessarily received with it the knowledge of moral truth Hence there exists a sovereign fundamental law as well as an order of duties and truths But if man on the contrary has made his speech himself he has made his thought he has made his law he has made society he has made everything and can destroy everything and it is right that in the same party that asserts that speech is of human institution society is regarded as an arbitrary convention    Theocracy ideal of reactionary thought is based on both contempt for and fear of man on the notion that he is too corrupt to deserve freedom that he does not know how to use it and that when it is granted him he uses it against himself so that in order to remedy his failure laws and institutions must be made to rest on a transcendent principle preferably on the authority of the old terrible God always ready to intimidate and discourage revolutions The new theocracy will be haunted by the old the legislation of Moses is the only one if we follow de Maistre to have withstood time it alone emerges from the circle drawn around human power Bonald for his part will see in it the strongest of all legislations since it has produced the most stable people destined to preserve the deposit of all truths If the Jews owe their civil rehabilitation to the Revolution it devolved upon the Restoration to reconsider their religion and their past to exalt their sacerdotal civilization which Voltaire had flouted The Christian seeking the antecedents of his God quite naturally comes up against Jehovah thus the fate of Israel intrigues him The interest our two thinkers took in Israel was not however exempt from political calculations This stable people supposedly hostile to the craving for innovation that dominated the age what a reproach to the fickle nations oriented toward modern ideas A transient enthusiasm when de Maistre realized that the Jews in Russia faithless toward their theocratic tradition were echoing certain ideologies imported from France he turned against them calling them subversive spirits and the depth of abomination in his eyes comparing them to Protestants One dares not imagine the invectives reserved for them had he foreseen the role they were later to play in the movements of social emancipation as much in Russia as in Europe Too concerned by Moses tablets de Maistre could not anticipate those of Marx    His affinities with the spirit of the Old Testament were so deep that his Catholicism seems so to speak Judaic imbued with that prophetic frenzy of which he found but a faint trace in the gentle mediocrity of the Gospels Tormented by the demon of vaticination he sought everywhere signs heralding the return to Unity the final triumph of    origins the end of the process of degradation inaugurated by Evil and Sin signs that obsess him to the point where he forgets God for them or ponders Him to penetrate His manifestations rather than His nature not Being but its reflections and these appearances by which God is manifested are called Providence sightings ways artifices of the alarming the unspeakable divine strategy Because the author of the Soirees constantly invokes mystery because he reverts to it every time his reason comes up against some impassable frontier readers have insisted despite the evidence on his mysticism whereas the true mystic far from questioning himself upon mystery or diminishing it to a problem or making use of it as a means of explanation on the contrary settles himself within it from the start is inseparable from it and lives inside it as one lives inside a reality his God not being like that of the prophets absorbed by time traitor to eternity entirely external and superficial but indeed that God of our soliloquies and our lacerations the deep God in Whom our outcries gather De Maistre evidently has opted for the God of the prophets a sovereign God it is vain to rail against or be offended by a churchwarden God uninterested in souls just as he had opted for an abstract mystery annex of theology or dialectics a concept rather than an experience Indifferent to the encounter of human solitude and divine solitude much more accessible to the problems of religion than to the dramas of faith inclined to establish between God and ourselves relations that are juridical rather than confidential he increasingly emphasizes the laws does he not speak as a magistrate of the mystery and reduces religion to a simple cement of the political edifice to the social function it fulfills a hybrid synthesis of utilitarian preoccupations and theocratic inflexibility a baroque melange of fictions and dogmas If he preferred the Father to the Son he will prefer the Pope to either by which I mean that practicalminded in spite of everything he will reserve for their delegate the most brilliant of his flatteries He has suffered a Catholic stroke this witticism to which he was inspired by Werner s conversion suits de Maistre as well for it is not God who has stricken him but a certain form of religion an institutional expression of the absolute A similar stroke had also affected Bonald a thinker chiefly concerned with constructing a system of political theology In a letter of July   de Maistre wrote to him Is it possible Monsieur that nature has entertained herself by putting two strings as perfectly in tune as your mind and mine It is the most rigorous unison a unique phenomenon One regrets this conformity of views with a lusterless and deliberately limited writer of whom Joubert once remarked He s a squireen of great wit and great knowledge erecting his first prejudices into doctrines but ultimately it sheds a certain light on the direction de Maistre s thought was taking as on the discipline he had imposed upon himself in order to avoid risk and subjectivism in matters of faith Yet from time to time the visionary in him triumphs over the theologian s scruples and wresting him from the Pope and the rest raises him to the perception of eternity Occasionally I should like to hurl myself beyond the narrow limits of this world I would like to anticipate the day of revelations and plunge into the infinite When the double law of man will be erased and these two centers united he will be ONE no longer having a war within how would he have any idea of duality But if we consider men comparing them with each other what will become of them when Evil being annihilated there will be no more passion or personal commitment What will the Self become when all thoughts will be common like all desires when all minds will see each other as they are seen Who can understand who can represent to himself that heavenly Jerusalem where all the inhabitants penetrated by the same spirit will penetrate one another and each reflect the other s happiness What will the Self become This concern is not that of a mystic for whom the self precisely is a nightmare he intends to be rid of by vanishing into God where he knows the ecstasy of unity object and end of his quest De Maistre seems never to have attained unity by sensation by the leap of ecstasy by that intoxication in which the contours of being dissolve for him unity remained the obsession of a theoretician Attached to that self of his he had difficulty imagining the heavenly Jerusalem the return to a blessed predivision identify as well as that nostalgia for paradise he must nonetheless have experienced if only as a limitstate In order to conceive how such nostalgia can constitute an everyday experience we must consider a figure by whom de Maistre was strongly influenced that Claude de SaintMartin who admitted to possessing only two things or to use his own words two posts paradise and the dust In  I saw an old man in England named Best who had the faculty of quotings to anyone he met very appropriate passages of Scripture without his ever having known you before Upon seeing me he began by saying He has cast the world behind him In a period of triumphant ideology when the rehabilitation of man was noisily undertaken no one was so deeply anchored in the Beyond as SaintMartin nor more qualified to preach the Fall he represented the other face of the eighteenth century The hymn was his element indeed he was the hymn examining his writings we have the sensation of finding ourselves in the presence of an initiate to whom great secrets were transmitted and who exceptionally did not waste his ingenuity upon them A true mystic he disliked irony antireligious by definition irony never pays how could this man who had cast the world behind him have resorted to it who perhaps knew but one pride that of the Sigh All nature is but a concentrated suffering If I had not found God my mind could never have attached itself to anything on earth I had the happiness to feel and to say that I would believe myself wretched indeed if something prospered for me in the world And let us add this vast metaphysical disappointment Solomon reports having seen everything under the sun I could cite someone who would not be lying if he said he had seen something more that is everything above the sun and that someone is very far from glorying in what he has seen As discreet as they are profound such notations taken chiefly from the posthumously published works cannot win us over to the intolerable lyricism of L Homme de Desir where everything is vexing except the title and where unfortunately for the reader Rousseau is present on every page A curious fate let us remark in passing that of Rousseau acting on others only by his dubious aspects and whose windiness and jargon have spoiled the style of a SaintMartin as much as that of a    Robespierre The declamatory tone before during and after the Revolution everything that heralds reveals and disqualifies Romanticism the horrors of poetic prose in general stem from this paradoxically inspired and unsound mind responsible for the generalization of bad taste toward the end of the eighteenth century and the beginning of the next A deadly influence that marked Chateaubriand and Senancour and that only Joubert managed to escape SaintMartin yielded to it all the more readily because his literary instincts were never very certain As for his ideas pastured in the vague they were capable of exasperating Voltaire who after reading the book Des Erreurs et de la Verite wrote to d Alembert I do not believe that anything more absurd more obscure more insane and more foolish has ever been printed It is irritating that de Maistre should have shown a pronounced taste for this work though this appeared it is true at a time when he was sacrificing both to Rousseauism and to theosophy But at the very moment he was renouncing one and the other moving away from illuminism and in a spasm of ingratitude and ill humor taxing Freemasonry with stupidity he kept all his sympathy for the philosophe inconnu whose theses on primitive knowledge matter sacrifice and salvation by blood he had adopted and developed Would the very notion of the Fall have assumed such importance for him had it not been vigorously affirmed by SaintMartin The notion was certainly banal even stale but in rejuvenating it rethinking it as a free mind disengaged from all orthodoxy our theosophist conferred upon it that extra authority which only the heterodox can impart to tired religious themes He did the same for the notion of Providence which preached thanks to him in the Lodges of the period acquired a seductiveness it could have received from no Church It was also one of SaintMartin s merits to have given in the midst of endless progress a religious accent to the malaise of living in time to the horror of being imprisoned within it De Maistre would follow him on this path though with less exaltation and ardor Time he tells us is something compelled that asks only to end Man is subject to time and nonetheless he is by nature alien to time so much so that the notion of eternal happiness joined to that of time fatigues and frightens him In de Maistre s thought entrance into eternity is effected not by ecstasy by the individual leap into the absolute but by the mediation of an extraordinary event one likely to seal off becoming and not by the instantaneous suppression of time achieved in delight but by the end of time the denouement of the historical process in its entirety It is need we repeat as a prophet and not as a mystic that de Maistre envisages our relations with the temporal universe There is no longer any religion on earth the human race cannot remain in this state Dreadful oracles announce moreover that the time has come Each epoch tends to think that it is in some sense the last that with it ends a cycle or all cycles Today as yesterday we conceive hell more readily than the golden age apocalypse than utopia and the idea of a cosmic catastrophe is as familiar to us as it was to the Buddhists to the preSocratics or to the Stoics The vivacity of our terrors keeps us in an unstable equilibrium favorable to the flowering of the prophetic gift This is singularly true for the periods following great convulsions The passion for prophesying then seizes everyone skeptics and fanatics alike delight in the idea of disaster and give themselves up in concert to the pleasure of having foreseen and trumpeted it abroad But it is especially the theoreticians of Reaction who exult tragically no doubt over the reality or the imminence of the worst of the worst that is their raison d etre I am dying with Europe de Maistre wrote in  Two years earlier in a letter to de Maistre himself Bonald had expressed an analogous certitude I have no news for you you are in a position to judge what we are and where we are going Moreover for me there are certain things that are absolutely inexplicable escape from which does not seem to me within human power insofar as men act by their own lights and under the influence of their wills alone and in truth what I see most clearly in all this  is the Apocalypse After conceiving the Restoration both men were disappointed to see that once it had become a reality it failed to erase the vestiges of the Revolution in men s minds a disappointment that they anticipated perhaps judging from the eagerness with which they abandoned themselves to it Whatever the case the course they assigned to history was quite ignored by history itself it flouted their projects it belied their systems De Maistre s darkest observations the ones that reveal a romantic complacency date from the period when his ideas seem to have triumphed In a letter of September   he writes to his daughter Constance    an invisible iron arm has always been over me like a dreadful nightmare that keeps me from running even from breathing The rebuffs he suffered from King VictorEmmanuel doubtless had much to do with these fits of depression but what disturbed him most was the prospect of new upheavals the specter of democracy Unwilling to resign himself to the future forming before his eyes though he had foreseen it he hoped with the incurable optimism of the defeated that since his ideal was threatened everything else was too that along with the form of civilization he approved of civilization itself was disappearing an illusion as frequent as it is inevitable How to dissociate oneself from a historical reality that is collapsing especially when it was previously in accord with one s inmost self Finding it impossible to endorse the future one lets oneself be tempted by the notion of decadence which without being true or false at least explains why each period in attempting to achieve its own individuality does so only by sacrificing certain very real and irreplaceable earlier values The old regime had to perish a principle of exhaustion had undermined it long before the Revolution came to finish it off Should we deduce from this the superiority of the Third Estate Not at all forthe bourgeoisie despite its virtues and its reserves of vitality by the quality of its tastes marked no progress over the fallen nobility The relays occurring down through history reveal the urgency less than the automatism of change If in the absolute nothing is dated in the relative in the immediate everything risks being so for the new constitutes the sole criterion metamorphosis the sole morality To grasp the meaning of events let us envisage them as a substance offered to the eye of an utterly disabused observer The makers of history do not understand it and those who participate in it to any extent are its dupes or its accomplices Only the degree of our disillusion guarantees the objectivity of our judgments but life being partiality error illusion and willtoillusion is not the passing of objective judgments a passage to the realm of death The Third Estate in asserting itself would necessarily be impermeable to elegance to refinement to a worthy skepticism to the manners and the style that defined the old regime All progress implies a retreat any rise a fall but if we collapse as we advance that collapse is limited to a circumscribed sector The advent of the bourgeoisie liberated the energies it had accumulated during its forced absence from political life from this perspective the change provoked by the Revolution incontestably represents a step forward The same is true of the appearance on the political stage of the proletariat destined in its turn to replace a sterile and ankylosed class but it is just here that a principle of retrogradation functions since the lastcomers cannot safeguard certain values that redeem the vices of the liberal era the horror of uniformity the sense of adventure and of risk the passion for a relaxed tone in intellectual matter the imperialist appetite on the level of the individual much more than on that of the collectivity    An inexorable law strikes and directs societies and civilizations When for lack of vitality the past collapses clinging to it serves no purpose and yet it is this attachment to antiquated forms of life to lost or bad causes that makes so touching the anathemas of a de Maistre or a Bonald Everything seems admirable and everything is false in the Utopian vision everything is execrable and everything seems true in the observations of the reactionaries It goes without saying that in positing heretofore so clearcut a distinction between Revolution and Reaction we have necessarily sacrificed to naivete or to laziness to the comfort of definitions One always simplifies out of facility whence the attraction of the abstract The concrete fortunately exposing the convenience of our explanations and our concepts teaches us that a revolution that has run its course that has established itself becomes the contrary of a fermentation and a birth ceases to be a revolution that it imitates and must imitate the features the apparatus and even the functioning of the order it has overturned the more it exerts itself in doing so and it cannot do otherwise  the more it will destroy its principles and its prestige Henceforth conservative in its way it will do battle to defend not the past but the present Here nothing will help it so as much as following the paths and the methods employed by the regime it has abolished Hence in order to insure the permanence of the conquests it prides itself on the revolution will turn from the exalted visions and dreams from which it had formerly drawn the elements of its dynamism Only the prerevolutionary condition is truly revolutionary the one in which men s minds subscribe to the double cult of the future and of destruction So long as a revolution is only a possibility it transcends history s givens and constants it exceeds so to speak its context But once it has occurred it conforms to that context and prolonging the past follows its ruts all the more successfully if it utilizes the techniques of the reaction it had previously condemned Every anarchist conceals in the depth of his rebellions a reactionary who is awaiting his hour the hour of taking power when the metamorphosis of chaos into    authority raises problems no utopia dares solve or even contemplate without falling into lyricism or absurdity Every impulse of renovation at the very moment when it approaches its goal when it realizes itself through the State creeps toward the automatism of the old institutions and assumes the face of tradition As it defines and confirms itself it loses energy and this is also true of ideas the more formulated and explicit they are the more their efficacy diminishes A distinct idea is an idea without a future Beyond their virtual status thought and action degrade and annul themselves one ends up as system the other as power two forms of sterility and failure Though we can endlessly debate the destiny of revolutions political or otherwise a single feature is common to them all a single certainty the disappointment they generate in all who have believed in them with some fervor That the basic essential renewal of human realities is conceivable in itself but unrealizable in fact should make us more understanding with regard to a de Maistre Though we may regard one or another of his opinions as abhorrent he is nonetheless the representative of that philosophy immanent to any regime congealed in terror and dogmas Where can we find a theoretician more fanatically opposed to becoming to praxis He hated action as the prefiguration of a rupture as the likelihood of becoming since for him to act was to remake The revolutionary himself deals this way with the present in which he installs himself and which he would eternalize but his present will soon be the past and by clinging to it he ends up joining the advocates of tradition The tragic aspect of the political universe resides in that hidden force which leads every movement to deny itself to betray its original inspiration and to corrupt itself as it confirms itself as it advances This is because in politics as in everything we fulfill ourselves only upon our own rains Revolutions start in order to give a meaning to history such meaning has already been given replies reaction we must submit to it and defend it This is exactly what will be maintained by a revolution that has triumphed hence intolerance results from a hypothesis that has degenerated into a certitude and that is imposed as such by a regime from a vision promoted to the rank of truth Each doctrine contains in germ infinite possibilities for disaster since the mind is constructive only by inadvertence the encounter of man and idea almost always involves a deadly sequel Imbued with the futility of reforms with the vanity and the heresy of improvements reactionaries would spare humanity the lacerations and exhaustions of hope the pangs of an illusory quest be satisfied with what has already been acquired they suggest abdicate your anxieties in order to bask in the bliss of stagnation and opting for an irrevocably official state of affairs choose finally between the instinct for preservation and the craving for tragedy But man open to all choices rejects precisely this one In this rejection in this impossibility his drama is played out whence it comes about that he is at once or alternately a reactionary and a revolutionary animal Fragile though the classical distinction may be moreover between the concept of revolution and that of reaction we must nonetheless retain it on pain of chaos or confusion in the consideration of political phenomena It constitutes a reference point as problematical as it is indispensable a suspect but inevitable and obligatory convention And it is also the one that obliges us constantly to speak of right and left terms that have no correspondence to intrinsic and irreducible givens terms so summary that we should like to leave to demagogues alone the faculty and the pleasure of utilizing them It sometimes happens that the right we need merely think of national uprisings prevails over the left in vigor force and dynamism espousing the characteristics of revolutionary spirit it then ceases to be the expression of an ossified world of a group of interests or of a declining class Conversely the left snagged in the mechanism of power or imprisoned by antiquated superstitions can easily lose its virtues harden and exhibit the very flaws that commonly affect the right Vitality being no one s privilege the analyst must determine its presence and intensity with no concern for the doctrinal varnish of this or that movement this or that political or social reality Next let us consider nations some make their revolution on the right others on the left Though the former s revolution is often but a simulacrum it nonetheless exists and this alone reveals the inanity of any univocal determination of the notion of revolution Right and left simple approximations that unfortunately we cannot do without Not to resort to them would be to renounce taking sides to suspend one s judgment in political matters to free oneself of the servitudes of duration to require of man that he waken to the absolute that he become uniquely a metaphysical animal Such an effort of emancipation such a leap outside our sleepers truths is accessible to few We are all dozing and paradoxically that is why we take action Let us continue then as if nothing had occurred let us go on making our traditional distinctions happy not to know that the values appearing in time are in the last instance interchangeable The reasons that impel the political world to forge its concepts and categories are quite different from those invoked by a theoretical discipline if they appear equally necessary to both those of the former still conceal realities that are less honorable all doctrines of action and of combat with their apparatus and their Schemas were invented only to give men a good conscience permitting them to hate each other    nobly without embarrassment without remorse Upon reflection would it not be legitimate to conclude that when facing events the free mind refractory to the play of ideologies but still subject to time has a choice only between despair and opportunism De Maistre could no more be an opportunist than he could despair his religion his principles forbade it But with his moods prevailing over his faith he frequently had fits of discouragement especially at the spectacle of a civilization without a future witness his observations on Europe He was not the only man who believed that he was dying with the continent    In the last century and in ours many have been convinced that Europe was on the point of expiring or that it had only one recourse to conceal its decrepitude by means of coquetry The notion that the continent was in its death agony had spread and acquired a certain vogue on the occasion of the great defeats in France after   and  in Germany after the collapse of  or that of  Yet Europe indifferent to its Cassandras cheerfully perseveres in its agony and that agony so stubborn so durable is perhaps equivalent to a new life This whole problem which comes down to a question of perspective and of ideology if it is meaningless for Marxists nonetheless preoccupies both liberals and conservatives horrified as they are though as defenders of different positions to be witnessing the disappearance of their reasons for living of their doctrines and of their superstitions That a form of Europe is dying today no one will dispute though such a death must be seen as no more than a simple stage of an immense decline With Bergson died according to Valery the last representative of European intelligence The formula might serve for other homages or speeches for we shall find for a long while to come some last representative of the Western mind    He who proclaims the end of civilization or of intelligence does so out of rancor toward a future that to him seems hostile and out of vengeance against history faithless history that does not deign to conform to his image of it De Maistre was dying with his own Europe with the Europe that rejected the spirit of innovation the greatest scourge as he called it It was his conviction that in order to save societies from disorder a universal idea acknowledged by fair means or foul was necessary which would eliminate the danger of entertaining in religion and in politics novelty approximation theoretical scruples That this universal idea was incarnated in Catholicism he had no doubt the diversity of regimes of mores and of gods troubling him not at all Against the relativism of experience he set up the absolute of dogma that a religion might cease to submit to it that it might permit private judgment and liberty of thought he declared harmful and did not hesitate to deny in the name of religion Mohammedanism and paganism itself would have done less harm politically if they had been substituted for Christianity with their species of dogmas and faith for they are religions and Protestantism is no such thing So long as he maintained some loyalty to the principles of Freemasonry he remained quite open to a certain liberalism once his hatred of the Revolution drove him into the arms of the Church he slid toward intolerance Whether they take their inspiration from utopia or from reaction absolutisms resemble and unite with each other Independent of their doctrinal content which differentiates them only on the surface they participate in one and the same schema one and the same logical process a phenomenon proper to all the systems that not content to posit an unconditional principle also make of it a dogma and a law An identical mode of thought presides over the elaboration of theories that are materially dissimilar but formally analogous As for the doctrines of Unity they are so closely related that to study one whatever it may be is thereby to scrutinize all the regimes that rejecting diversity in concept and in practice deny man the right to heresy to singularity or to doubt Obsessed with Unity de Maistre raves against any attempt likely to dissolve it against the least impulse of innovation or even of autonomy without realizing that heresy represents the sole possibility of reinvigorating men s consciences that by shaking them up it preserves them from the sluggishness into which conformism plunges them and that if heresy weakens the Churchy on the other hand it reinforces religion Any official god is a god alone abandoned soured We pray with fervor only in sects among persecuted minorities in darkness and in fear conditions indispensable to the proper exercise of piety But for a de Maistre submission I should say rather the rage of submission surpasses the effusions of faith Lutherans Calvinists Jansenists were if we are to believe him merely rebels conspirators traitors he abhors them and advises for their annihilation the use of all means that are not crimes Yet if we read his apology for the Inquisition our impression is that even this last resort is one he does not entirely reject De Maistre is the Machiavelli of theocracy Unity as he conceives of it presents itself in a double aspect metaphysical and historical On the one hand it signifies triumph over division evil and sin on the other definitive instauration final apotheosis of Catholicism through the victory over temptations and modern errors Unity on the level of eternity unity on the level of time If the first transcends us if it escapes our possibilities for control the second we can envisage and deal with Let us say it straight off it seems to us illusory it leaves us skeptical For we do not see what religious idea would today be capable of achieving the spiritual and political unification of the world Christianity is too weak to seduce or to subdue men s minds an ideology or a conqueror must be resorted to Will the task fall to Marxism or to a Caesarism of a new type Or to both at once Such a synthesis seems dismaying only to reason but not to history that reign of anomaly That Catholicism better still that the Christian religion in its entirety should be in utter deliquescence our experience teaches us every day as it now appears prudent accommodating measured Christianity would not tolerate an apologist so fierce so magnificently unbridled as de Maistre who would not have denounced with such fury the sectarian spirit in others had he not been uniquely imbued with it himself The man who cursed the Terror does not find one word with which to castigate the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes he even applauds it With regard to the manufactures taken by the refugees into foreign countries and to the wrong done to France as a result the persons for whom these shopkeeping objections signify something    Shopkeeping objections Unsurpassable his bad faith is either a joke or a sort of madness Louis XIV crushed Protestantism and died in his bed covered with glory and heavy with years Louis XVI toyed with the thing and died on the scaffold In another place in a fit of    moderation de Maistre acknowledges that the critical spirit a spirit of protest appears well before Luther and he rightly traces it back to Celsus to the very beginnings of the opposition to Christianity For the Roman patrician in effect the Christian was a dismaying actually inconceivable phenomenon a subject of stupor In his True Discourse a moving text if ever there was one Celsus raves against the actions of this new sect that has managed through its intrigues and its excesses to aggravate the situation of the empire presently beleaguered by the Barbarians He did not understand why a man might prefer to Greek philosophy a suspect and nebulous teaching which disgusted him but of which not without a certain despair he foresaw the contagious power and the terrible opportunities Sixteen centuries later his argumentation and his invective were adopted by Voltaire who similarly aghast at Christianity s amazing career did his best to advertise its ravages and its abuses That such a work whose salubrity leaps to the eye should be at the origin of the Terror is another exaggeration of de Maistre s for whom irreligion and scaffold are correlative terms We must absolutely slay the spirit of the eighteenth century he urges forgetting that this spirit he so hates had only one fanaticism that of tolerance And then by what right condemn the guillotine when one has been so tender about the stake The contradiction does not seem to disturb the admirer of the Inquisition servant of one cause he legitimated its excesses while execrating those committed in the name of another This is the paradox of the partisan mind and it is an eternal one To regard the eighteenth century as the privileged moment as the very incarnation of evil is to indulge in aberrations In what other period were injustices denounced so rigorously A salutary oeuvre of which the Terror was the negation and not the consummation Never says Tocqueville had tolerance in religion mildness in command humanity and even benevolence been more extolled and it appeared more acknowledged than in the eighteenth century the right to wage war which is in a sense the last refuge of violence was itself confined and rationalized Yet from the heart of such gentle manners would nonetheless emerge the most inhuman revolution In reality the period too civilized had achieved a refinement that doomed it to fragility to a brilliant and ephemeral term Gentle manners and dissolute ones go together as is proved by the Regency the most agreeable and most lucid hence the most corrupt era of modern history The vertigo of being free was beginning to weigh on men s minds Already Madame du Deffand more indicative of the century than Voltaire himself had remarked that liberty was not a good thing for everyone that rare were those who could tolerate its darkness and its emptiness And it was to flee this emptiness and this darkness it seems to us that France flung herself into the wars of the Revolution and of the Empire in which she willingly sacrificed those habits of independence of defiance and of analysis that a hundred years of conversation and skepticism had enabled her to acquire Threatened with disaggregation by this debauch of irony and intelligence France would recover her balance through the collective adventure through a craving for submission on a national scale Men de Maistre informs us can never be united for any goal whatever without a law or a rule that deprives them of their will one must be a priest or a soldier This vice of our nature far from saddening de Maistre delights him and he seizes upon it in order to praise to the skies the papacy royalty the Spanish tribunals and all the symbols of authority Of the Jesuits those accomplices of autocracies he was first the pupil later the spokesman and such were his admiration and his gratitude that he admits to being indebted to them for not having been an orator of the Constituent Assembly The judgments he passes on himself almost always concern the Revolution and his relations with it and it is always with regard to the Revolution that he defends or denigrates France This Savoyard who once called himself the most French of all foreigners is one of those who best penetrated the genius of the initiator nation destined by its dominant quality the spirit of proselytism to exercise over Europe a veritable magistracy Providence having decreed he tells us the era of the French he cites in their regard Isaiah s phrase Every word of this people is a conspiracy Applied to France at that moment the phrase was true it would be less so subsequently and would cease to have any meaning at all after the war of  If the Revolution was present in all the shocks of the nineteenth century none of them could equal it Obsessed by the figures of  the insurgents of  paralyzed by the fear of betraying their models were epigones prisoners of a style of revolt that they had not created and that was so to speak imposed upon them A nation never produces two great revolutionary ideas nor two radically different forms of messianism It gives its measure but once in a circumscribed defined epoch the supreme moment of its expansion when it triumphs with all its truths and all its lies it exhausts itself afterward as does the mission with which it was invested Since the October Revolution Russia has exerted the same kind of influence terror and fascination that France generated in  In its turn Russia has imposed its ideas on a world that welcomes them subjugated trembling or zealous And its proselytizing power is even greater than France s was de Maistre today would maintain more appropriately that Providence had this time decreed the era of the Russians he would even apply to them Isaiah s phrase and perhaps would also say of them that they are an initiator nation Moreover in the very period he lived among them he was far from underestimating their capacities There is no man who desires as passionately as the Russian if we could imprison a Russian desire beneath a fortress that fortress would explode The nation that at the time was said to be indolent and apathetic to him seemed the most mobile the most impetuous the most enterprising in the universe The world did not begin to realize as much until after the Decembrist rebellion   a crucial event after which reactionaries and liberals the former out of apprehension the latter out of desire began predicting upheavals in Russia here was evidence of the future that required in order to be proclaimed no prophetic faculty Never had anyone seen a revolution so sure to come so expected as the Russian Revolution the most widespread reforms the humanization of the regime the best will in the world the largest concessions nothing could have stopped it There was no merit in its explosion since it existed so to speak before appearing and since it could be described down to the last detail one need merely think of The Possessed before manifesting itself Since the only guarantors of good order were in de Maistre s eyes slavery and religion he advocated the maintenance of serfdom for the consolidation of czarist power since the Orthodox Church he disdained seemed to him adulterated warped contaminated by Protestantism and in any case unlikely to counterbalance subversive ideas But did the Catholic Church in the name of the true religion succeed in preventing the Revolution in France He never even asks himself the question what interests de Maistre is absolute government and in his opinion all government is absolute government for he claims the moment it can be resisted on the pretext of error or injustice it no longer exists That occasionally one encounters in de Maistre impulses of liberalism echoes of his early education or expressions of a more or less conscious remorse is undeniable Yet the human side of his doctrines is of only mediocre interest Since his talents ripen and really function only in his antimodern excesses his outrages to common sense it is natural that it should be the reactionary in him who holds our attention Every time he insults our principles or upbraids our superstitions in the name of his own we have occasion to rejoice the writer then excels and outdoes himself The darker his vision the more he will enfold it in a light transparent appearance The impulsive aesthete that he was concerned himself even in the midst of his high rages with the minuscule problems of language he fulminated as a litterateur even as a grammarian and his frenzies not only failed to diminish his passion for the correct and elegant formulation but augmented it even more An epileptic temperament infatuated with the trifles of the Word trances and boutades convulsions and bagatelles grace and a foaming mouth everything combined to compose that pamphleteering universe at whose heart he harried error with blows of invective those ultimatums of impotence It was his humiliation that he could never erect his prejudices and his fixations into laws He took revenge for this situation through utterance whose virulence sustained in him the illusion of efficacy Never seeking a truth for its own sake but only in order to make it an instrument of combat unable to acknowledge others absolutes or to be indifferent to them  defining himself by his refusals and still more by his aversions de Maistre needed for the exercise of his intelligence inveterately to execrate someone or something and to brood over his or its suppression This was an imperative a condition indispensable to the fecundity of his disequilibrium without which he would have fallen into sterility the curse of thinkers who refuse to cultivate their disagreements with others or with themselves The spirit of tolerance had he yielded to it would not have failed to smother his genius We may further note that for someone so sincerely taken with paradox the one way of being original after a whole century of declamations concerning liberty and justice was to embrace the opposing opinions to hurl himself upon other fictions upon those of authority in short to exchange aberrations When in  Napoleon read in Milan the Considerations sur la France perhaps he saw in them a justification of his own ambitions and something like the itinerary of his own dreams he had only to interpret to his advantage the arguments for royalty that de Maistre made there On the other hand the speeches and writings of the liberals of Necker of Madame de Stael and of Benjamin Constant must have vexed him since he found in them according to the expression of Albert Sorel the theory of the obstacles to his reign Repudiating the concept of destiny liberal thought could scarcely beguile a conqueror who not content to meditate upon destiny still aspired to incarnate it to be its concrete image its historical translation tending as he did by nature to rely on Providence and to consider himself its interpreter The Considerations revealed Bonaparte to himself Too much is made of lovehate and we forget that there exists an even murkier and more complex sentiment admirationhate the very feeling that de Maistre nourished for Napoleon How lucky to have for one s contemporary a tyrant worthy of being abhorred to whom one might dedicate a cult in reverse and whom secretly one would like to resemble In obliging his enemies to raise themselves to his level compelling them to jealousy Napoleon was a real blessing Without him neither Chateaubriand nor Constant nor de Maistre could so readily have resisted the temptation to measure to proportion the histrionics of the first the instability of the second and the rages of the third partook of his own histrionics his instability his rages The horror he inspired in them included a good deal of fascination To combat a monster is necessarily to possess some mysterious affinities with him and also to borrow from him certain character traits De Maistre recalls Luther whom he insulted so and even more Voltaire the man he attacked most as well as the Pascal of the Provincial Letters enemy of the Jesuits that is the Pascal whom he loathed As a good pamphleteer he set upon the pamphleteers of the other side whom he understood so well for like them he had a mania for inexactitude and a talent for parti pris When he defines philosophy as the art of disdaining objections he defines his own method his own art Yet preposterous as it seems the assertion is nonetheless true or almost true who would defend a position who would support an idea if he had to multiply his scruples ceaselessly weigh pros and cons and conduct a reasoning with all due precautions The original thinker forges ahead rather than digging in he is a Draufganger an enthusiast a breakneck and in any case a determined combative mind a rebel in the realm of abstraction whose aggressiveness though sometimes veiled is nonetheless real and effective Under his apparently neutral preoccupations camouflaged as problems stirs a will functions an instinct as indispensable as intelligence to the creation of a system without the collaboration of that instinct and that will how to triumph over objections and over the paralysis to which they doom the mind No assertion that cannot be annihilated by a contrary assertion In order to offer any opinion about anything bravura action and a certain capacity for thoughtlessness are necessary as well as a propensity for letting oneself be carried away by extrarational reasons The entire human race de Maistre says is descended from one couple This truth has been denied like all the rest and what of that This means of disposing of objections is practiced by anyone who identifies himself with a doctrine or who merely adopts a welldefined viewpoint on any subject but rare are those who dare acknowledge as much who have probity enough to divulge the method they employ and must employ on pain of hardening into approximation or silence In one of those blunders that do him honor de Maistre priding himself on an abusive use of and what of that implicitly yields the secret of his extravagances Not at all exempt from that naivete so characteristic of dogmatism he will make himself the interpreter of all the possessors of a certitude and will proclaim his happiness and theirs We happy possessors of the truth a triumphal language that for the rest of us remains inconceivable but that delights and fortifies the believer A faith that acknowledges other faiths that does not believe itself to possess a monopoly on truth is doomed to ruin abandoning the absolute that legitimates it resigning itself to being no more than a phenomenon of civilization an episode an accident A religion s degree of inhumanity guarantees its strength and its duration a liberal religion is a mockery or a miracle Reality a terrible and exact observation true at every point for the JudeoChristian world to posit a single god is to profess intolerance and to subscribe willynilly to the theocratic ideal On a more general level the doctrines of Unity proceed from the same spirit even when they lay claim to antireligious ideas they follow the formal schema of theocracy they even boil down to a secularized theocracy Positivism derived a great advantage from retrograde systems whose content and beliefs it rejected only to adopt their logical armature their abstract contours Auguste Comte treated de Maistre s ideas as Marx treated Hegel s Variously curious as to the fate of religion but equally subjugated by their respective systems positivists and Catholics exploited to the best of their abilities the thought of the author of Du Pape freer Baudelaire found in it out of sheer inner necessity several themes such as those of evil and of sin or certain of his prejudices against democratic ideas and progress When Baudelaire makes true civilization consist in the diminution of the traces of original sin is he not inspired by that passage of the Soirees where the perfect state of civilization is presented as a reality situated outside the realm of the Fall De Maistre and Edgar Poe have taught me to reason perhaps it would have been more precise on Baudelaire s part to admit that the ultramontanist thinker had furnished him with obsessions When he invokes a diabolic providence or professes satanism Baudelaire turns certain Maistrian motifs inside out aggravating them and lending them a character of concrete negativity The philosophy of the Restoration had certain rather unexpected literary extensions the influence of Bonald on Balzac was as powerful as that of de Maistre on Baudelaire Probe the past of a writer especially of a poet  examine in detail the elements of his intellectual biography and you will always find some reactionary antecedents    Memory is the condition of poetry the past its substance And what does Reaction assert if not the supreme value of the past What one believes true one must say and say it boldly I should like were it to cost me dear to discover a truth likely to shock the entire human race I should tell it pointblank The Baudelaire of absolute frankness of Fusees and of Mon Coeur mis a nu is contained and somehow heralded in this remark from the Soirees which gives us the recipe for that incomparable art of provocation in which Baudelaire was to distinguish himself almost as much as de Maistre Everyone distinguishes himself there moreover who whether with lucidity or with acrimony rejects the clever enchantments of Progress Why do conservatives wield invective so well and for the most part write more carefully than the adepts of the future It is because furious at being contradicted by events they fling themselves in their confusion upon the Word from which lacking a more substantial resource they derive vengeance and consolation The others resort to it more casually and even with contempts accomplices of the future sure of themselves with regard to history they write without art even without passion conscious as they are that style is the prerogative and somehow the luxury of failure When we speak of failure we are thinking not only of de Maistre but also of SaintSimon In one as in the other the same exclusive limited attachment to the cause of the aristocracy a host of prejudices defended with a continual rage the pride of caste carried to ostentation and a similar incapacity to act which explains why they were so enterprising as writers When the former concerns himself with problems when the latter describes events the slightest idea the merest fact explodes under the passion each invests in it Trying to dissect their prose is tantamount to analyzing a thunderstorm Far be it from us however to put the duke and the count on the same footings the former restored and recreated an epoch he worked straight from life whereas the latter was content to animate ideas now with concepts how attain to the plenitude of genius There is no true creation in philosophy whatever depth and originality it achieves thought always maintains itself at a derived level this side of Being s movement and activity art alone rises to that height art alone imitates God or substitutes for Him The thinker exhausts the definition of the incomplete man SaintSimon according to SainteBeuve suggests a melange of Shakespeare and Tacitus for us de Maistre would evoke a less felicitous mixture Cardinal Bellarmine and Voltaire a theologian and a litterateur If we cite the name of the great controversialist that professional of quibbling who raged against Protestantism in the sixteenth century it is because de Maistre with more verve and more spirit was to wage the same campaign was he not in some sense the last representative of the CounterReformation Contemplating his transports against the new sects we sometimes wonder if there is not a degree of humor in all this deployment of rage is it conceivable that in writing certain diatribes de Maistre was not conscious of the enormities he was uttering And yet we can never say it often enough it is these enormities that rescue his works and lure us to read them still When on the subject of an assertion of Bacon s he exclaims No never since Fiat Lux was spoken has the human ear heard anything equal such extravagance delights us as does this The priests have preserved everything have revived everything and have taught us everything An insane assertion whose savor is undeniable in making it did the author become the accomplice of our smiles And when he assures us that the Pope is the demiurge of civilization does he intend to divert us or is this what he truly thinks It would be simplest to admit that he was sincere moreover we discern not the slightest trace of charlatanism in his life lucidity in his case never went to the lengths of imposture or farce    That is the sole failing in his sense of excess There was in this conservative who destroyed in the name of tradition in this fanatic by discipline and by method a desire to possess unshakable convictions a need to be all of a piece I fall into an idea as from a precipice complained a sick man de Maistre could have said as much though with this difference that he longed to fall there that he burned to be engulfed and that like certain aggressive thinkers enraged thinkers he was impatient to take us down with him abyssal proselytism that is the mark of fanaticism innate or acquired His though acquired the result of effort and deliberation he assimilated perfectly and made it his organic reality Nailed to the absolute out of hatred of a century that had called everything into question he would go too far in the other direction and out of fear or doubt would erect deliberate blindness into a system Never to be short of illusions to obnubilate himself such was his dream He had the good fortune to realize it Despite his moments of clairvoyance he was nonetheless mistaken in many of his expectations The mission of France he imagined was the religious regeneration of humanity France turned to secularity  He predicted the end of schisms the return of the separated churches to Catholicism the reconquest by the Sovereign Pontiff of his ancient privileges Rome abandoned to herself is more modest more timid than ever If he foresaw some of the convulsions that were to shake Europe he did not divine those to which we are prey But the nullity of his prophecies should not make us lose sight of the merits or the actuality of this theoretician of order and authority who had he had the luck to be better known would have been the inspiration of every form of political orthodoxy the genius and the providence of all our century s despotisms His thought is incontestably alive today but only to the degree that it repels or disconcerts the more we frequent him the more we are reminded a contrario of the delights of skepticism or of the crying need for a vindication of heresy  Fractures WHEN ONE HAS EMERGED from the circle of errors and illusions within which actions are performed taking a position is virtually an impossibility A minimum of silliness is essential for everything for affirming and even for denying To glimpse the essential no need to ply a trade Stay fiat on your back all day long and moan    Whatever puts me at odds with the world is consubstantial with myself How little I have learned from experience My disappointments have always preceded me There exists an undeniable pleasure in knowing that everything you do has no real basis that whether or not you commit an action is a matter of indifference The fact nonetheless remains that in our daily gestures we compromise with Vacuity that is we turn and turn about and occasionally at the same time we take the world as real and unreal We mingle pure truths and sordid truths and this amalgam the thinker s disgrace is the living man s revenge It is not the violent evils that mark us but the secret insistent tolerable ones belonging to our daily round and undermining us as conscientiously as Time itself After a quarter of an hour no one can observe another s despair without impatience Friendship has scope and interest only for the young For an older person it is apparent that what he dreads most is being survived by his friends One can imagine everything predict everything save how low one can sink What still attaches me to things is a thirst inherited from ancestors who carried the curiosity to exist to the point of ignominy How we must have loathed each other in the pestilential darkness of the caves Easy to understand why the painters who managed to keep body and soul together there had no desire to immortalize the image of their kind why they preferred the figures of animals Having renounced sanctity    to think I could have uttered such a thing I must have an excuse and I don t despair of finding it Except for music everything is a lie even solitude even ecstasy Music in fact is the one and the other only better How age simplifies everything At the library I ask for four books Two are set in type that is too small I discard them without even considering their contents The third too    serious seems unreadable to me I carry off the fourth without conviction One can be proud of what one has done but one should be much prouder of what one has not done Such pride has yet to be invented After an evening in his company you were exhausted for the necessity of controlling yourself of avoiding the slightest allusion likely to wound him and everything wounded him ultimately left you depleted irritated with him and with yourself You resented having to side with him out of scruples carried to the lowest degree of flattery you despised yourself for not having exploded instead of letting yourself in for so wearying an exercise in    delicacy We never say of a dog or a rat that it is mortal Why is man alone entitled to this privilege After all death is not man s discovery and it is a sign of fatuity to imagine oneself its unique beneficiary As memory weakens the praise that has been lavished upon us fades too to the advantage of the censure And this is just the praise has rarely been deserved whereas the censure sheds a certain light on what we did not know about ourselves If I had been born a Buddhist I should have remained one born a Christian I ceased being one in early youth when much more so than today I would have abounded in the sense of Goethe s blasphemy when he wrote the very year of his death to Zelter The Cross is the most hideous image on this earth The essential often appears at the end of a long conversation The great truths are spoken on the doorstep What is dated in Proust those trifles swollen by a dizzying prolixity the eddies of the Symbolist manner the accumulation of effects the poetic saturation As if SaintSimon had undergone the influence of the Precieuses No one would read him today A letter worthy of the name is written in the wake of admiration or outrage of exaggeration in short We realize why a sensible letter is a stillborn one I have known obtuse writers even stupid ones On the other hand the translators I have managed to approach were more intelligent and more interesting than the authors they translated After all it takes more reflection to translate than to create Someone regarded as extraordinary by his intimates must not furnish proofs against himself Let him take care not to leave traces above all not to write if he ever hopes to seem what he has been for the happy few For a writer to change languages is to write a love letter with a dictionary I feel you have come to hate what

incarnates to succeed in being no more than an exhausted illusion Lucidity a permanent martyrdom an unimaginable tour de force Those who want to tell us scandalous confidences count quite cynically on

rubbing up against his kind would be so extravagant as to greet them thus To survive a destructive book is no less painful for the reader than for the author We must be in a state of receptivity that is of physical weakness for words to touch us to insinuate themselves into us and there begin a sort of career To be called a deicide is the most flattering insult that can be addressed to an individual or to a people Orgasm is a paroxysm despair too One lasts an instant the other a lifetime She had the profile of Cleopatra Seven years later she might just as well be begging on the street Enough to cure you forever of idolatry of any craving to seek the unfathomable in a pair of eyes in a smile etc Let us be reasonable No one can see through everything completely Nor without universal disillusion can there be universal knowledge either What is not heartrending is superfluous at least in music Brahms represents die Melancholie des Unvermogens the melancholy of impotence according to Nietzsche This judgment passed on the brink of the philosopher s collapse forever dims its luster To have accomplished nothing and to die overworked Those imbecilic people one passes how have they come to this And how to imagine such a spectacle in antiquity in Athens for example One moment of acute lucidity among these damned souls and all illusions collapse The more you loathe humanity the riper you are for God for a dialogue with no one Extreme fatigue goes quite as far as ecstasy except that with fatigue you descend toward the extremities of knowledge Just as the advent of the Crucified One has cut history in two in the same way this night has severed my life Everything seems debased and futile once the music stops You understand that music can be hated and one is tempted to identify its absolute status with fraudulence This is because we must react at any cost against it when we love it too much No one has realized this danger better than Tolstoy for he knew that music could do with him as it liked Hence he began execrating it out of fear of becoming its plaything Renunciation is the only kind of action that is not degrading Can we imagine a city dweller who does not have the soul of a murderer To love only the indefinite thought that never reaches words and the instantaneous thought that lives by words alone divagation and boutade A young German asks me

to him without being able to forget that he would not survive the week What madness on his part to speak of the future of his future But once I had left once I was outside how to avoid thinking that after all the difference was not so great between the mortal and the moribund The absurdity of making plans is only a little more obvious in the second case We always date ourselves by our admirations As soon as we cite anyone but Homer or Shakespeare we risk seeming oldfashioned or dotty It is just possible to imagine God speaking French Christ never His words do not function in a language so ill at ease in the naive or the sublime So long to have questioned ourselves about man impossible to carry the taste of the morbid further Does fury come from God or from the Devil From both otherwise how

denigrate it What could be healthier what could be more natural What is neither healthy nor natural is the frantic appetite to exist a grave flaw a law par excellence my flaw  Valery Facing His Idols IT IS A MISFORTUNE for an author to be understood as Valery was in his lifetime as he has been subsequently Was he so simple then so penetrable Certainly not But he was imprudent enough to furnish too many details about himself and his work he revealed himself gave himself away supplied any number of keys and dissolved a good many of those misunderstandings indispensable to a writer s secret prestige Instead of leaving the labor of decipherment to others he took it upon himself he made a kind of vice out of the craving for selfdisclosure This singularly facilitated the commentators task by initiating them from the start into his essential actions and preoccupations he invited them to ruminate not so much upon his work as upon the remarks he himself had made about it Henceforth the Valerian question would be whether on this or that point concerning him he had been the victim of an illusion or on the contrary of an excessive clairvoyance in either case of a judgment dislocated from reality Not only was Valery his own commentator but indeed all his works are merely a more or less camouflaged autobiography an adept introspection a diary of his mind a promotion of his experiences any of his experiences to the rank of intellectual event an assault upon anything unconsidered that might be within him a rebellion against his depths To be capable of dismantling the mechanism of everything since everything is mechanism a sum of contraptions artifices or to use a more honorable word operations to deal with the springs and ratchets to become a watchmaker to see inside to cease to be duped that is what counts in his eyes Man as Valery conceives him is valued only for the degree of lucidity he may attain his capacity for nonconsent This demand for lucidity suggests the level of awakening that any mental experience supposes and that is determined by the answer to the crucial question How far have you gone in the perception of unreality We might trace in some detail the parallel between a quest for lucidity deliberately this side of the absolute as we find it in Valery and a quest for awakening with a view to the absolute which is strictly speaking the mystic way In both procedures what is involved is an exacerbated consciousness eager to shake off the illusions trailing after it Any pitiless analyst any betrayer of appearances a fortiori any nihilist is merely a blocked mystic and this only because he is reluctant to grant a content to his lucidity to inflect it toward salvation by associating it with an enterprise transcending it Valery was too contaminated by positivism to conceive any cult but that of lucidity for its own sake I confess I have made my mind into an idol but I have found nothing else that would serve Valery would never get over the amazement produced in him by the spectacle of that mind He admired only men who deified theirs and whose aspirations were so excessive that they could only fascinate or dismay What seduced him in Mallarme was the madman the fanatic who had written to Verlaine in  I have always imagined and attempted something else with an alchemist s patience ready to sacrifice all vanity and all satisfaction the way such men once burned up their own furniture and the very rafters of their house in order to feed the furnace of the Great Work Which is what It is hard to say a book quite simply in many volumes a book that really is a book architectural and premeditated and not a collection of chance inspirations however marvelous    I shall go further and say The Book convinced after all that there is only one As early as  he had formulated in a letter to Cazalis the same grandiose and insane aspiration    it would cause me a real pang to enter into the supreme Disappearance without having completed my work which is The Work the Great Work as the alchemists our ancestors used to call it To create a work that rivals the worlds that is not its reflection but its double this notion Mallarme derived not so much from the alchemists as from Hegel that Hegel whom he knew only indirectly from Villiers who had read the philosopher just enough to be able to quote him on occasion and to call him pompously the reconstruct tor of the Universe a formula that must have struck Mallarme since The Book specifically intends the reconstruction of the Universe But this notion could also have been inspired by his frequentation of music by the theories of the period derived from Schopenhauer and propagated by the Wagnerians who made music the one art capable of translating the essence of the world Moreover Wagner s enterprise itself could suggest great dreams and lead to megalomania quite as easily as alchemy or Hegelianism A musician especially a fecund one can aspire to the role of demiurge but how could a poet and a poet delicate to the point of sterility undertake such a thing without absurdity or madness All of which partakes of divagation to use a word Mallarme was fond of And it was precisely in this aspect that he beguiled that he convinced Valery imitates and extends him when he speaks of that Commedia of the intellect he intended to write some day The dream of excess leads to absolute illusion When on November   Mallarme showed Valery the corrected proofs of Un Coupde des and asked him Don t you find this an act of madness The madman was not Mallarme but the Valery who in a fit of sublimity would write that in the strange typography of that poem the author had attempted to raise a page to the power of the starry heavens To assign oneself a task impossible to realize and even to define to crave vigor when one is corroded by the subtlest of anemias in all this there is a touch of theater a desire to deceive oneself to live intellectually beyond one s means a will to legend and to defeat for at a certain level the man of failure is incomparably more captivating than the one who has merely achieved success We are increasingly interested not in what an author says but in what he may have meant not in his actions but in his projects less in his actual work than in the work he dreamed of If Mallarme intrigues us it is because he fulfills the conditions of the writer who is unrealized in relation to the disproportionate ideal he has assigned himself an ideal so disproportionate that we are sometimes inclined to call a man naive or insincere who in reality is merely hallucinated obsessed We are adepts of the work that is aborted abandoned halfway through impossible to complete undermined by its very requirements The strange thing in this case is that the work was not even begun for of The Book that rival of the Universe there remains virtually no revealing clue it is doubtful that its structure was outlined in the notes Mallarme destroyed those that have survived being unworthy of our attention Mallarme an impulse of thought a thought that was never actualized that snagged itself on the potential on the unreal disengaged from all actions superior to all objects even to all concepts an expectation of thought And what he enemy of the vague ultimately expressed is just that expectation which is nothing but vagueness itself Yet such vagueness the space of excess affords a positive aspect it permits imagining big It was by dreaming of The Book that Mallarme achieved the unique had he been more reasonable he would have left us a mediocre body of work We can say as much of Valery who is the result of his almost mythological vision of his faculties of what he might have extracted from them if he had had the chance or the time to put them to actual use Are not his Cahiers the bricabrac of The Book that he too wanted to write He went further than Mallarme but realized no better than he a scheme that requires persistence and a great invulnerability to boredom to that wound which by his own admission continually tormented him Yet such boredom is discontinuity itself impatience with any sustained grounded reasoning a pulverized obsession the horror of system The Book could only have been a system a total system  horror of an idea s insistence of its duration boredom is also the non sequitur the fragment the note the cahier in other words dilettantism consequent upon a lack of vitality and also upon a fear of being or of seeming deep Valery s attack on Pascal might be explained by a reaction of modesty is it not indecent to display one s secrets one s lacerations one s abysses Let us not forget that for a Mediterranean such as Valery the senses mattered and that for him the basic categories were not what is and what is not but what is not at all and what might exist Nothingness and the Apparent being as such lacked dimension in his eyes and even significance Neither Mallarme nor Valery was equipped to confront The Book Before them Poe would have been able both to conceive such a project and to undertake it indeed he did undertake it Eureka being a kind of limitwork an extremity an end a colossal and realized dream I have solved the secret of the Universe I no longer desire to live since I have written Eureka these are exclamations Mallarme would have loved to utter he had no right to do so not even after that magnificent impasse Un Coup de des Baudelaire had called Poe a hero of letters Mallarme went further and called him the absolute literary case No one today would assent to such a judgment but that is of no consequence for each individual like each epoch possesses reality only by his exaggerations by his capacity to overestimate by his gods The sequence of philosophical or literary fashions testifies to an irresistible need to worship who has not put in time as a hagiographer A skeptic will always manage to venerate someone more skeptical than himself Even in the eighteenth century when disparagement became an institution the decadence of admiration was not to be so general as Montesquieu had supposed For Valery the theme treated in Eureka resulted in literature Cosmogony is a literary genre of a remarkable persistence and of an amazing variety one of the oldest genres there is He believed as much of history and even of philosophy a special literary genre characterized by certain subjects and by the frequency of certain terms and certain forms It may be said that with the exception of the positive sciences everything came down to literature for him to something dubious if not contemptible But where are we to find someone more literary than he someone in whom attention to the word idolatry of utterance is more intensely sustained A Narcissus turned against himself he disdained the only activity in accord with his nature predestined to the Word he was essentially a litterateur and it was this litterateur he wanted to smother to destroy unable to do so he took his revenge on the literature he so maligned Such would be the psychological schema of his relations with it Eureka did not affect Valery s development On the other hand The Philosophy of Composition was a major event a crucial encounter Everything he was subsequently to believe about the mechanism of the poetic act is there We can imagine the delight with which he must have read that the composition of The Raven could in no way be attributed to chance or to intuition and that the poem had been conceived with the precision and the rigorous logic of a mathematical problem Another of Poe s declarations this time from Marginalia CXVIII  must have gratified him no less It is the curse of a certain order of mind that it can never rest satisfied with the consciousness of its ability to do a thing Still less is it content with doing it It must both know and show how it was done The Philosophy of Composition was on Poe s part a mere hoax all Valery comes out of a    naive reading the idolatry of a text in which a poet dupes his credulous readers Such youthful enthusiasm for so basically antipoetic a demonstration proves that initially in his depths Valery was no poet for his whole being should have bridled in protest at this cold and pitiless dismantling of rapture this indictment of the most elementary poetic reflex of poetry s very raison d etre but no doubt he needed such cunning incrimination such a rebuke to any spontaneous creation in order to justify to excuse his own lack of spontaneity What could be more reassuring than this studious exposition of devices Here was a catechism not for poets but for versifiers and one that would necessarily flatter in Valery that virtuoso aspect that yen for oneupmanship in reflection for art to the second degree for the art within art that religion of taking pains along with that will to be at every moment outside of what one creates outside of any intoxication poetic or otherwise Only a maniac of lucidity could savor this cynical reversion to the sources of the poem contradicting all the laws of literary production this infinitely meticulous premeditation these outrageous acrobatics from which Valery drew the first article of his poetic credo He erected into a theory and proposed as a model his very incapacity to be a poet naturally he bound himself to a technique in order to conceal his congenital lacunae he set an inexpiable offense poetics above poetry We can legitimately suppose that all his theses would be quite different had he been capable of producing a less elaborated oeuvre He promoted the Difficult out of impotence all his requirements are those of an artist and not of a poet What in Poe was merely a game is in Valery a dogma a literary dogma that is an accepted fiction As a good technician he attempted to rehabilitate method and metier at the expense of talent From any and every theory it is art I am speaking of he was concerned to extract the least poetic conclusion and it is to that conclusion he would cling beguiled as he was to the point of obnubilation by praxis by invention stripped of fatality of the ineluctable of destiny He always believed one might be other than one is and always wanted to be other than he was as is evidenced by that gnawing regret of his at not being a scientist a regret that inspired him to a good many extravagances especially in aesthetics it was also this regret that inspired his condescension toward literature as if he debased himself by speaking of it and merely deigned to trifle with verses As a matter of fact he did not trifle with them he practiced them as he specifically said so many times At least the nonpoet in him keeping him from mingling poetry and prose from trying to create like the Symbolists poetry at all costs and on all occasions saved him from that scourge any prose that is too ostensibly poetic When we approach a mind as subtle as Valery s we experience a rare pleasure in discovering its illusions and its flaws which if they are not obvious are no less real absolute lucidity being incompatible with existence with the exercise of breathing And we must admit a disabused mind whatever its degree of emancipation from the world lives more or less within the unbreathable Poe and Mallarme exist for Valery Leonardo evidently is but a pretext a name and nothing more a figure entirely constructed a monster who possesses all the powers one lacks and longs for He answers that need to see oneself fulfilled realized in some imagined person who represents the ideal epitome of all the illusions one has created about oneself a hero who has conquered one s own impossibilities who has delivered one from one s limits transcending them in one s place    The Introduction to the Method of Leonardo da Vinci which dates from  proves that Valery in his initial phases was perfect that is perfectly ripe as a writer the chore of selfimprovement of making progress he was spared from the start His case is not without analogies to that of his compatriot who could declare at SaintHelena War is a singular art I can assure you I have waged sixty battles and I have learned no more than I already knew after the first Valery at the end of his career could maintain that he too knew everything from his very first efforts and that with regard to demands upon himself and his work he was no more advanced at sixty than at twenty At an age when everyone gropes and apes everyone else he had found his manner his style his form of thought He would still admire no doubt but as a master Like all perfect minds his was limited that is confined within certain themes from which he could not escape It was perhaps in reaction against himself against his evident frontiers that he was so intrigued by the phenomenon of a universal mind by the scarcely conceivable possibility of a multiplicity of talents that flourish without harming each other that cohabit without canceling each other out He could not fail to encounter Leonardo yet Leibnitz made a deeper impression No doubt But to confront Leibnitz required not only the scientific competence and knowledge that he lacked but an impersonal curiosity of which he was incapable With Leonardo symbol of a civilization a universe or whatever the arbitrary and the casual were much more comfortable If one quoted him now and then it was only in order to talk more readily about oneself about one s own tastes and distastes to settle accounts with the philosophers by invoking a name that all by itself summed up faculties none of them ever combined For Valery the problems philosophy approached and the way it expressed them came down to abuses of language to false problems fruitless and interchangeable lacking all rigor verbal or intrinsic To him it seemed that an idea was denatured as soon as the philosophers got hold of it even that thought itself was vitiated upon contact with them His horror of philosophic jargon is so convincing so contagious that one shares it forever after so that one can no longer read a serious philosopher except with suspicion or distaste henceforth rejecting any falsely mysterious or learned term Most philosophy boils down to a crime of leselangage a crime against the Word Any professional expression any expression of the schools must be proscribed and identified with a misdemeanor Anyone who in order to settle a difficulty or solve a problem invents a highsounding pretentious word indeed a word at all is unconsciously dishonest In a letter to F Brunot Valery once wrote It takes more intelligence to do without a word than to introduce one If we were to translate the philosophers lucubrations into normal language what would be left of them The enterprise would be ruinous for the vast majority But we must immediately add that it would also be ruinous for most writers singularly so for a Valery if we stripped his prose of its luster reduced one or another of his thoughts to skeletal contours what would it still be worth He too was the dupe of language of another language one more real more existent it is true He did not invent words of course but he lived in a quasiabsolute fashion within his own language so that his superiority over the philosophers was precisely that he participated in less of an unreality than they By criticizing them so severely he showed that he too ordinarily so disabused could be carried away could be deluded A total disenchantment moreover had stifled in him not only the man of thought as he sometimes called himself but a more serious loss the jongleur the histrion of syllables Fortunately he did not achieve that imperturbable clairvoyance he dreamed of otherwise his silence might have lasted until his death Considered further his aversion to the philosophers has something impure about it as a matter of fact he was obsessed with them could not be indifferent to them pursued them with an irony bordering on dyspepsia All his life he forswore any attempt to build a system yet he nourished as with regard to science a more or less conscious regret for the system he could not build The hatred of philosophy is always suspect as if one does not forgive oneself for not having been a philosopher and in order to mask that regret or that incapacity mistreats those who less scrupulous or more gifted had the luck to construct that improbable little universe a wellarticulated philosophical doctrine That a thinker should regret the philosopher he might have been is understandable less so that this regret should still encumber a poet we are reminded once again of Mallarme since The Book could only be the work of a philosopher Glamour of rigor of thought without charm If the poets are so sensitive to it it is out of a sort of mortification at living quite shamelessly as parasites of the Improbable Academic philosophy is one thing metaphysics is another We might have expected Valery to show a certain indulgence toward the latter nothing of the kind He denounces it quite insidiously and comes close to treating it as does the logical positivism to which he is in many respects so close as a disease of language He even made it a point of honor to ridicule all metaphysical anxiety the torments of a Pascal inspire him to the reflections of an engineer No revelations for Leonardo No abyss opens at his side For him an abyss suggests a bridge An abyss might be useful for experiments involving some huge mechanical bird When we read remarks so unforgivably casual we can have only one reaction to avenge Pascal on the spot What was the sense of blaming him for abandoning the sciences when that abandonment was the result of a spiritual awakening much more important than the scientific discoveries he might have made subsequently In the scale of the absolute the Pascalian perplexities on the confines of prayer weigh more heavily than any secret wrested from the external world Any objective conquest presupposes an interior retreat When man has achieved the goal he has assigned himself to enslave Creation then he will be completely empty god and ghost Scientism that great illusion of modern times Valery espoused without reservations without second thoughts Is it a mere accident that in his youth in Montpellier he occupied the bedroom lived in years before by Auguste Comte theoretician and prophet of all scientism Of all the superstitions the least original is that of science No doubt we can engage in scientific activity but enthusiasm for it when we are not on the team is embarrassing to say the least Valery himself created his poetmathematician legend And everyone accepted it though he himself acknowledged that he was merely an unhappy lover of the loveliest of the sciences and once declared to Frederic Lefevre that as a young man he had failed to become a navel cadet because of an absolute incomprehension of the mathematical sciences I didn t understand one iota For me it was the strangest most impenetrable most dismaying thing in the world No one has ever understood less of the existence and virtually the possibility of even the simplest mathematics than myself in those days That subsequently he acquired a taste for mathematics is undeniable but to acquire a taste and to achieve mastery are two very different things He became interested either to create for himself a peerless intellectual status to make himself the hero of a drama at the limit of the mind s powers  or to enter a realm where one is not constantly encountering oneself There are no words to express the delight of realizing that a world exists from which the Self is entirely absent Did Valery know Sophie Kowalevsky s remark about mathematics Perhaps an analogous need led him toward a discipline so remote from any form of narcissism But if we question the existence of this profound necessity for him his relations with the sciences will suggest the infatuation of those Enlightenment ladies whom he mentions in his preface to the Persian Letters and who haunted the laboratories and became fanatics of anatomy or astronomy We must admit and praise him for it that in his way of delivering himself upon the sciences we recognize the tone of a man of the world of the grande epoque the last echo of those bygone salons We might also detect in his pursuit of the unapproachable a touch of masochism to worship in order to torment oneself what one will never achieve to punish oneself for being in the realm of Knowledge a mere amateur The only problems he confronted as a connoisseur as an initiate were those of form or to be more precise of writing A syntactic genius Claudel s description of Mallarme applies even better to Valery who himself attributes to Mallarme the faculty of conceiving and placing above all works the conscious possession of the function of language and the sentiment of a superior freedom of expression in regard to which any thought is merely an incident a particular event Valery s cult of rigor goes no further than correctness of terms and a conscious effort toward an abstract brilliance of phrase Rigor of form and not of substance La Jeune Parque required more than a hundred drafts the author prided himself upon them and in them discerned the very symbol of a rigorous enterprise To leave nothing to the powers of improvisation or inspiration accursed synonyms in his eyes  to scrutinize words to weigh them never to forget that language is the sole the unique reality such is this willtoexpression carried so far that it turns into a fanaticism about trifles an exhausting search for infinitesimal precision Valery the galley slave of Nuance He went to the extremity of language where the latter aerial dangerously subtle is no more than a lacy essence a last stage before unreality We cannot conceive of a discourse more refined than his more marvelously bloodless Why deny that in many places it is finicky or distinctly precious He himself held preciosity in high esteem as this significant avowal testifies Who knows if Moliere has not cost us a Shakespeare in casting such ridicule upon les precieux The trouble with preciosity is that it makes a writer too conscious too imbued with his superiority over his instrument by wielding it with such virtuosity he dispossesses language of all mystery and all vigor Now language must resist if it yields it capitulates utterly to the whims of a prestidigitator resolved into a series of pirouettes and trouvailles in which it constantly triumphs over and divides against itself to the point of annihilation Preciosity is the writing of writing a style that doubles itself and becomes the object of its own quest It would be abusive to regard Valery as a precieux but it is just to say that he had fits and starts of preciosity quite natural in someone who perceived nothing behind language no substratum or residue of reality Only words preserve us from nothingness such seems to be the content of his thought though content is a term he rejected in both its metaphysical and its aesthetic acceptation The fact remains that he emphatically banked on words and thereby proved he still believed in something Only if he had finally become detached from them could we have called him a nihilist In any case he was too sensitive to the urgency of the lifelie for nihilism One would lose courage if one were not sustained by false ideas said Fontanelle the writer whom in the grace he could lend to the slightest idea Valery most resembles Poetry is threatened when poets take too lively a theoretical interest in language and make it into a constant subject of meditation when they confer upon it an exceptional status that derives less from aesthetics than from theology The obsession with language always intense in France has never been so virulent and so sterilizing as it is today we are not far from promoting the means the intermediary of thought into the sole object of thought even into a substitute for the absolute not to say for God There is no vital fecund thought that encroaches on reality if the word is brutally substituted for the idea if the vehicle counts more than the load it transports if the instrument of thought is identified with thought itself If we are truly to think thought must adhere to the mind if it becomes independent of the mind exterior to it the mind is shackled from the start idles and has but one resource left itself instead of relying on the world for its substance or its pretexts The writer must guard against reflecting excessively upon language must avoid making it the substance of his obsessions must never forget that the important works have been created despite language A Dante was obsessed by what he had to say not by the saying of it For a long time indeed forever one is tempted to say French literature seems to have succumbed to the enchantment and to the despotism of the Word hence its tenuity its fragility its extreme delicacy and also it mannerism Mallarme and Valery crown a tradition and prefigure an exhaustion both are terminal symptoms of a grammarian nation One linguist could even declare that Mallarme treated French like a dead language and that he might never have heard it spoken To which we may add that there was a touch of the poseur in him of the ironic and tricky Parisian Claudel had observed a suspicion of charlatanism though of the highest order  the lassitude of a man who has seen through everything features we shall recognize to a somewhat more marked degree in the Valery of the indefinite refusal to be anything in particular key formula of his intellectual enterprise leading principle rale and motto of his mind And in effect Valery will never be entire will not identify himself with beings or with things will be off to one side marginal to everything and this not because of some malaise of a metaphysical order but out of an excess of reflection on the operations on the functioning of consciousness The ruling idea the idea that gives meaning to all his efforts circles that distance which consciousness takes with regard to itself that consciousness of consciousness as it chiefly appears in the Note and Digression of  his philosophic masterpiece in which seeking some constant amid our sensations and our judgments he finds it not in our changing personality but in the pure ego universal pronoun appellation of that which has no relation to a face which has no name which has no history and which is in short merely a phenomenon of exacerbated consciousness merely a limitexistence quasifictive stripped of any fixed content and without any relation to the psychological subject This sterile ego a summa of refusals quintessence of nothing conscious void not consciousness of the void but a void that knows itself and rejects the accidents and vicissitudes of the contingent subject  this ego last stage of lucidity of a lucidity decanted and purified of any complicity with objects or events is located at the antipodes of the Ego infinite productivity cosmogonic force as German Romanticism had conceived it Consciousness intervenes in our actions only to frustrate their execution consciousness is a perpetual interrogation of life it is perhaps the ruin of life Bewusstsein als Verhangnis Consciousness as Fatality is the title of a book published in Germany between the two world wars whose author drawing the consequences of his vision of the world committed suicide There is as far as we can see in the phenomenon of consciousness a dramatic and deadly dimension that did not escape Valery we need merely recall the murderous lucidity of Dance and the Soul  but he could not emphasize it too much without contradicting his usual theories about the beneficent role of consciousness in literary creation as opposed to the suspect character of trace His entire poetics what is it but the apotheosis of consciousness If he had lingered too long over the tension between the Vital and the Conscious he would have had to reverse the scale of values that he had set up and that he remained faithful to throughout his career The effort to define oneself to bear down upon one s own mental operations Valery took for true knowledge But to know oneself is not to know or rather is only a variety of knowing Valery always confused knowledge and clearsightedness Indeed the will to be clearsighted to be inhumanly disabused is accompanied for him by an illconcealed pride he knows himself and admires himself for knowing himself Let us be fair he does not admire his mind he admires himself as Mind His narcissism inseparable from what he called emotions and the pathos of the intellect is not a narcissism of journaux intimes it is not the attachment to the self as a unique aberration nor is it the ego of those who like to hear themselves psychologically speaking no it is an abstract ego far from the complacencies of introspection or the impurities of psychoanalysis Note that the flaw of Narcissus was not consubstantial with him how else explain that the sole realm in which posterity has strikingly vindicated Valery is that of political considerations and prophecies History an idol he was concerned to demolish is largely what ensures that he will last that he will continue to be present For it is his observations concerning History that are quoted most frequently an irony he would perhaps have enjoyed Doubts are cast on his poems his poetics are rejected but increasingly we set store by the moralist and the analyst attentive to events This lover of himself had the stuff of an extrovert Appearances one feels did not displease him nothing in him assumed a morbid profound supremely intimate aspect even the Nothingness he inherited from Mallarme was merely a fascination exempt from vertigo and never opened out onto horror or ecstasy In one of the Upanishads it is said that the essence of man is speech the essence of speech is the hymn Valery would have assented to the first assertion and denied the second It is in this assent and this denial that we must seek the key to his accomplishments and to his limits   The Lure of Disillusion IT IS NEVER ideas we should speak of only sensations and visions for ideas do not proceed from our entrails ideas are never truly ours Glum sky my mind masquerading as the firmament Ravaged by boredom that cyclone in slow motion There exists I grant you a clinical depression upon which certain remedies occasionally have an effect but there exists another kind a melancholy underlying our very outbursts of gaiety and accompanying us everywhere without leaving us alone for a single moment And there is nothing that can rid us of this lethal omnipresence the self forever confronting itself I assure this foreign poet who after hesitating among several capitals has decided on ours that he has chosen well that here he will find among other advantages that of starving to death without troubling a single soul To encourage him further I explain that here failure is so normal that it is a kind of Open Sesame This detail provided the finishing touchy judging from the gleam I detected in his eyes The very fact that you have reached the age you have proves that life has a meaning I was told by a friend I hadn t seen in over thirty years This remark often comes back to me more striking each time though it was made by someone who has always found a meaning in everything For Mallarme who claimed he was doomed to permanent insomnia sleep was not a real need but a favor Only a great poet could allow himself the luxury of such an insanity Insomnia appears to spare the animals If we kept them from sleeping for a few weeks a radical change would occur in their nature and their behavior They would experience hitherto unknown sensations the kind that seemed to be specifically human Let us wreck the animal kingdom if we want it to overtake and replace us In each letter I send to a Japanese friend I have got into the habit of recommending one or another work by Brahms She has just written that she is leaving a Tokyo clinic where she was taken by ambulance for having excessively sacrificed to my idol I wonder which trio which sonata was responsible It doesn t matter Whatever induces collapse is thereby deserving of being listened to There is no speculation about Knowledge no Erkenntnistheorie in which so many philosophers German or otherwise revel that offers the slightest homage to Fatigue as such the state likeliest to lead us to the heart of the matter This neglect or this ingratitude definitively discredits our philosophy A stroll through Montparnasse Cemetery All young or old made plans They make no more Strengthened by their example I swear as a good pupil returning never to make any myself ever Undeniably beneficial outing I ponder C for whom drinking in a cafe was the sole reason to exist One day when I was eloquently vaunting Buddhism to him he replied Well yes nirvana all right but not without a cafe We all have some mania or other that keeps us from unconditionally accepting supreme happiness Reading Madame Perier s testimony specifically the passage in which she tells how her brother Pascal from the age of eighteen by his own admission never spent a single day without suffering I was so astounded that I stuffed my fist into my mouth to keep from crying out This was in a public library I was it is worth noting eighteen myself What a presentiment but also what madness and what presumption To rid oneself of life is to deprive oneself of the pleasure of deriding it The one possible answer to someone who informs you of his intention to be done with it all Being never disappoints declares a philosopher Then what does Certainly not nonbeing by definition incapable of disappointing This advantage so irritating to our philosopher must have led him to promulgate so flagrant a countertruth The interesting thing about friendship is that it is almost as much as love an inexhaustible source of disappointment and outrage thereby of fruitful surprises it would be madness to try to do without The surest means of not losing your mind on the spot remembering that everything is unreal and will remain so    He offers me an unconscious hand I ask him many questions and lose my courage in the face of his outrageously laconic replies Not a single one of those useless words so necessary to dialogue Dialogue indeed Speech is a sign of life and that is why the chattering lunatic is closer to us than the tonguetied halfwit No possible defense against a flatterer You cannot agree with him without absurdity nor can you contradict him and turn your back You act as if he were telling the truth you let yourself be sent up because you don t know how to react He of course believes you are taken in that he has you where he wants you and enjoys his triumph without your being able to open his eyes Generally he is a future enemy who will take his revenge for having prostrated himself before you a disguised aggressor who ponders his blows while he pours out his hyperboles The most effective method for making loyal friends is to congratulate them upon their failures This thinker has taken refuge in prolixity as others do in stupor When you have circled around a subject for a certain amount of time you can immediately offer a judgment on any work that relates to it I have just opened a book on the gnostics and I immediately perceived that it was quite unreliable Yet I read only one sentence and am only a dilettante an incompetent in such matters Now imagine an absolute specialist a monster God for example whatever we do must to Him seem botched even our inimitable successes even those that ought to humiliate and embarrass Him Between Genesis and Apocalypse imposture reigns It is important to know this for once assimilated such dizzying evidence renders all formulas for wisdom superfluous If you have had the weakness to write a book you will not fail to admire that Hasidic rabbi who abandoned the project of writing one since he was not sure he could do so exclusively for the pleasure of his Creator If the Hour of Disappointment were to sound for everyone at the same time we should see an entirely new version either of paradise or of hell Impossible to enter into a dialogue with physical pain To withdraw indefinitely into oneself like God after the six days Let us imitate Him on this point at least The light of dawn is the true primordial light Each time I observe it I bless my sleepless nights which afford me an occasion to witness the spectacle of the Beginning Yeats calls it sensuous a fine discovery and anything but obvious Learning that he was going to marry soon I decided to conceal my amazement by a generality Everything is compatible with everything To which he replied You re right since man is compatible with woman A flame traverses the blood To go over to the other side circumventing death That favorable look one assumes on the occasion of a blow of fate    At the climax of a performance superfluous to specify one longs to exclaim Consummatum est The cliches of the Gospels and singularly of the Passion are always good to have at hand for those moments when you might imagine you could do without them Skeptical observations so rare in the Fathers of the Church are today regarded as modern Obviously since Christianity having played its part which at its beginnings heralded its end is now a subject of delectation Each time I see a filthy raving drunken bum prostrate with his bottle in the gutter I think of a future humanity experimenting with its future and pulling it off Though seriously deranged he utters nothing but banalities Occasionally a remark that borders on cretinism and genius Dislocation of the mind must indeed serve some purpose When you imagine you have reached a certain degree of detachment you regard as histrionic all zealots including the founders of religions But doesn t detachment too have a histrionics of its own If actions are mummery the very refusal of action is one as well Yet a noble mummery His nonchalance leaves me perplexed and admiring He shows no haste follows no direction generates enthusiasm for no subject As if at birth he had swallowed a tranquilizer whose effect has never worn off and which allows him to preserve his indestructible smile Pity the man who having exhausted his reserves of scorn no longer knows what to feel about others about himself Cut off from the world having broken with all his friends he read me with an almost indispensable Russian accent given the situation the beginning of the Book of Books Reaching the moment where Adam gets himself expelled from paradise he fell silent dreamily staring into the distance while I thought to myself more or less distinctly that after millennia of false hopes humanity furious at having cheated would finally receive the meaning of the curse and thereby make itself worthy of its first ancestor If Meister Eckhart is the only scholastic who is still readable it is because in him profundity is matched by charm by glamour an advantage rare in periods of intense faith Listening to some oratorio how can we admit that such beseechings such poignant effusions conceal no reality and concern no one that there is nothing behind them and that they must vanish forever into thin air In a Hindu village where the inhabitants wove cashmere shawls a European manufacturer made an extended stay while examining the weavers unconscious methods Having studied them thoroughly he revealed them to these simple souls who thereupon lost all spontaneity and became indeed very poor workers Excess of deliberation frustrates all actions To expatiate upon sexuality is to sabotage it altogether Eroticism scourge of deliquescent societies is an offense against instinct an organized impotence We do not reflect with impunity upon exploits that dispense with reflection Orgasm has never been a philosophical event My dependence on climate will forever keep me from acknowledging the autonomy of the will Meteorology determines the color of my thoughts One cannot be more crudely determinist than I am but I am helpless to alter the case    Once I forget I have a body I believe in freedom but I immediately abandon such belief when my body calls me back to order and imposes its miseries and its whims Montesquieu belongs here Happiness or misery consists in a certain arrangement of organs Had I done what I intended would I be happier today Certainly not Having set out to travel far toward the extremity of myself I have begun on the way to doubt my task all tasks It is under the effect of a suicidal mood that one usually becomes infatuated by a person an idea What a light cast upon the essence of love and of fanaticism No greater obstacle to deliverance than the need for failure To know in vulgar terms is to get over something to know in absolute terms is to get over everything Illumination represents one further step the certainty that henceforth we will never again be taken in a last glance at illusion I strive to conceive the cosmos without    myself Fortunately death is here to remedy my imagination s inadequacy Since our defects are not surface accidents but the very basis of our nature we cannot correct them without deforming that nature without perverting it still more What dates most is rebellion that is the most vital of our reactions In Marx s entire oeuvre I don t think there is a single disinterested reflection on death    I was pondering this at his grave in Highgate Id rather offer my life as a sacrifice than be necessary to anything In Vedic mythology anyone raising himself by knowledge upsets the comfort of Heaven The gods ever watchful live in terror of being outclassed Did the Boss of Genesis behave any differently Did he not spy on man because he feared him Because he saw him as a rival Under these conditions one understands the great mystics desire to lee God His limits and His woes in order to seek boundlessness in the Godhead By dying one becomes the despot of the world When you get over an infatuation to fall for someone ever again seems so inconceivable that you imagine no one not even a bug that is not mired in disappointment My mission is to see things as they are Exactly the contrary of a mission Coming from a country where failure constituted an obligation and where I couldn t fulfill myself was the leitmotif of all confidences    No fate to which I could have adjusted myself I was made to exist before my birth and after my deaths not during my very existence Those nights when you convince yourself that everyone has evacuated this universe even the dead and that you are the last living being here the last ghost In order to reach compassion you must carry selfconcern to the saturation point to nausea such paroxysms of disgust being a symptom of healthy a necessary condition for looking beyond one s own trials and tribulations The true Nowhere everywhere effigies from which nothing is to be expected So why add to an initial disappointment all those that follow and that confirm it with diabolic regularity day after day The Holy Ghost Luther instructs us is not a skeptic Not everyone can be and that is really too bad Discouragement ever at the service of knowledge hides the other side the inner shadow of persons and things hence the sensation of infallibility it gives The pure passing of time naked time reduced to an essence of flux without the discontinuity of the moments is realized in our sleepless nights Everything vanishes Silence invades everywhere We listen we hear nothing The senses no longer turn toward the world outside What outside Engulfment survived by that pure passage through us that is ourselves and that will come to an end only with sleep or daylight    Seriousness is not involved in the definition of existence tragedy is since it implies a notion of risk of gratuitous disaster whereas what is serious postulates a goal Now the great originality of existence is to have nothing to do with such a thing When you love someone you hope the more closely to be attached that a catastrophe will strike your beloved No longer to be tempted save by what lies beyond    extremes If I were to obey my first impulse I should spend my days writing letters of insult and adieu There is a certain shamelessness in dying Indeed there is something indecent about death This aspect understandably is the last that comes to mind I have wasted hour after hour ruminating upon what seemed to me eminently worthy of being explored upon the vanity of all things upon what does not deserve a second s reflection since one does not see what there is still to be said for or against what is obvious If I prefer women to men it is because they have the advantage of being more off balance hence more complex more perspicacious and more cynical not to mention that mysterious superiority conferred by an ageold slavery Akhmatova like Gogol wanted to possess nothing She gave away the presents given to her and a few days later they would be found in other people s houses This characteristic recalls the behavior of nomads compelled to the provisional by necessity and by choice Joseph de Maistre cites the case of a Russian prince and his friends who would sleep anywhere in his palace and had so to speak no fixed bed for they lived with the sentiment of being transitory there of camping out until it was time to pull up stakes    When Eastern Europe furnishes such models of detachment why seek them out in India or elsewhere Letters one receives filled with nothing but internal debate metaphysical interrogations rapidly become tiresome In everything there must be something petty if there is to be the impression of truth If the angels were to write they would be except for the fallen ones unreadable Purity passes with difficulty because it is incompatible with breathing Out in the street suddenly overcome by the mystery of Time I told myself that Saint Augustine was quite right to deal with such a theme by addressing himself directly to God with whom else to discuss it Everything that disturbs me I could have translated had I been spared the shame of not being a musician A victim of crucial preoccupations I had taken to my bed in the middle of the afternoon an ideal position from which to ponder a nirvana without remainder without the slightest trace of an ego that obstacle to deliverance to the state of nonthought A sentiment of blessed extinction initially then a blessed extinction without sentiment I believed myself on the threshold of the final stage it was only its parody only the swerve into torpor into the abyss of  a nap According to Jewish tradition the Torah God s work preceded the world by two thousand years Never has a people esteemed itself so highly To attribute such priority to its sacred book to believe it predates the Fiat Lux Thus is created a destiny Having opened an anthology of religious texts I came straight off upon this remark of the Buddha No object is worth being desired I closed the book at once for after that what else is there to read The older we grow the more we lack character Each time we manage to have such a thing we are uncomfortable we feel inauthentic whence our uneasiness in the presence of those who smell of conviction The felicity of having frequented a Gascon an authentic Gascon The particular Gascon I am thinking of I have never seen depressed All his disasters and they were considerable he described to me as triumphs The gap between him and Don Quixote was infinitesimal Yet he tried my Gascon to see clearly from time to time though his efforts came to nothing He remained to the end a trifler in disappointment Had I listened to my impulses I should be today unhinged or hanged I have noticed that following any internal shock my reflections after a brief flight take a lamentable and even grotesque turn This has been invariably the case in my crises whether decisive or not As soon as one makes any sort of leap outside of life life takes its revenge and brings one down to its level Impossible for me to know whether or not I take myself seriously The drama of detachment is that we cannot measure its progress We advance into a desert and we never know where we are in it I had gone far in search of the sun and the sun found at last was hostile to me And if I were to fling myself off a cliff While I was making such rather grim speculations considering these pines these rocks these waves I suddenly felt how bound I was to this lovely accursed universe Quite unjustly we grant depression only a minor status well below that of anguish Actually it is the more virulent affliction but refractory to the manifestations it affects More modest and yet more devastating it can appear at any moment whereas anguish being remote reserves itself for great occasions He comes as a tourist and I always encounter him by chance This time being especially expansive he confides to me that he is wonderfully healthy that he is conscious of a sense of wellbeing at all times I reply that his health seems suspect to me that it is not normal to feel in continual possession of health that true health is never felt Watch out for your wellbeing were my last words when I left him Unnecessary to add that I have not encountered him since At the slightest vexation and a fortiori at the slightest affliction hurry to the nearest cemetery sudden distributor of a peace to be sought elsewhere in vain A miracle cure for once Regret that backward transmigration by resuscitating our life at will gives us the illusion of having lived several times My weakness for Talleyrand    when one has practiced cynicism exclusively in words one is filled with admiration for someone who has so magisterially translated it into action If a government decreed in midsummer that vacations were to be indefinitely extended and that on pain of death no one was to leave the paradise in which he was sojourning mass suicides would follow and unprecedented carnage Happiness and misery make me equally wretched Then why does it sometimes happen that I prefer the former The depth of a passion is measured by the low feelings it involves feelings that guarantee its intensity and its continuance Grim Death a poor portraitist according to Goethe gives faces something false something outside of truth it is assuredly not Goethe who like Novalis would identify death with the principle that romanticizes life It must be said in his defense that having lived fifty years longer than the author of Hymnen an die Nacht Goethe possessed all the time required to lose his illusions about death In the train a middleaged woman of a certain distinction beside her an idiot of thirty her son who occasionally took her arm and kissed it then stared at her blissfully She was radiant and smiled back What a petrified curiosity might be I did not know I know now because I experienced it in the presence of this spectacle A new variety of consternation was revealed to me Music exists only so long as hearing it lasts just as God exists only so long as ecstasy lasts The supreme art and the Supreme Being have this in common that they depend entirely on ourselves For some indeed for the majority music is stimulating and consoling For others it is a longedfor dissolving agent an unhopedfor means of losing themselves of melting into what may be the best of themselves To break with one s gods with one s ancestors with one s language and one s country to break tout court is a terrible ordeal that is certain but it is also an exalting one avidly sought by the defector and even more by the traitor Of all that makes us suffer nothing so much as disappointment gives us the sensation of at last touching Truth As soon as one begins to fail instead of being upset about it one should invoke the right of no longer being oneself We obtain almost everything except what we secretly crave No doubt it is fair that what we most desire should be unattainable that the essential of ourselves and of our course through life should remain hidden and unrealized Providence has managed things well let each of us derive the pride and the prestige linked to intimate debacles Remaining consistent to this end according to the Zohar God created man and recommended frequentation of the Tree of Life Man however preferred the other tree located in the region of variations His fall A craving for change fruit of curiosity that source of all misfortunes Thus what was only a whim in the first among us was to become law for us all A touch of pity enters into any form of attachment into love and even into friendship though not into admiration To leave life unscathed this could happen but doubtless never does A toorecent disaster has the disadvantage of keeping us from perceiving its good sides Schopenhauer and Nietzsche in the last century spoke best of love and of music Yet each frequented only brothels and of all composers the former adored Rossini the latter Bizet Happening to encounter L I remarked that the rivalry among the saints was the sharpest and the most secret of all He asked me for examples I found none at the moment and find no more now Nonetheless the fact seems to me established    Consciousness summa of our discomforts from birth to the present Such discomforts have vanished consciousness remains but it has lost its origins it doesn t even know what they were Melancholy feeds on itself and that is why it cannot renew itself In the Talmud a stupefying assertion The more men there are the more images of the divine there are in nature This may have been true in the period when the remark was made but it is belied today by all one sees and will be still further belied by all that will be seen I anticipated witnessing in my lifetime the disappearance of our species But the gods have been against me I am happy only when I contemplate renunciation and prepare myself for it The rest is bitterness and agitation To renounce is no easy thing yet nothing but striving for it affords some peace Striving Merely thinking of it suffices to give me the illusion of being someone else and this illusion is a victory the most flattering one and also the most fallacious No one had to the same degree as he a sense of the world s absurdity Each time I alluded to it he would utter with a smile of complicity the Sanskrit word lila absolute gratuitousness according to the Vedanta the creation of the world by divine caprice How we laughed at everything together And now he the most jovial of the disabused here he is cast into this slough by his own fault since he has deigned for once to take nothingness seriously  Beckett Some Meetings TO FATHOM THIS separate man we should focus on the phrase to hold oneself apart the tacit motto of his every moment on its implication of solitude and subterranean stubbornness on the essence of a withdrawn being who pursues an endless and implacable labor In Buddhism it is said of an adept seeking illumination that he must be as relentless as a mouse gnawing on a coffin Every authentic writer makes a similar effort He is a destroyer who adds to existence who enriches by undermining it Our time on earth is not long enough to spend on anything but ourselves this remark by a poet applies to whoever refuses the extrinsic the accidental the other Beckett or the incomparable art of being oneself Withal no apparent pride no inherent stigma in the consciousness of being unique if the word amenity did not exist it would have had to be invented for him Scarcely credible indeed monstrous he disparages no one unaware of the hygienic function of malevolence its salutary virtues its executory quality I have never heard him speak ill of friends or enemies a form of superiority for which I pity him and from which unconsciously he must suffer If denigration were denied me what difficulties and discomforts what complications would result He lives not in time but parallel to it which is why it has never occurred to me to ask him what he thinks of events He is one of those beings who make you realize that history is a dimension man could have done without Were he like his heroes in other words had he gained no acceptance he would be exactly the same He gives the impression of not wanting to assert himself at all of being equally alien to the notion of success and to the notion of failure How hard it is to figure him out And what style he has I tell myself each time I think of him If by some impossibility he concealed no secret I would still regard him as Impenetrable I come from a corner of Europe where outbursts of abuse loose talk avowals immediate unsolicited shameless disclosures are de rigueur where you know everything about everyone where life in common comes down to a public confessional and specifically where secrecy is inconceivable and volubility borders on delirium This alone suffices to account for my fascination with a man who is supernaturally discreet Amenity does not exclude exasperation At a dinner with friends harried by absurdly pedantic questions about himself and his work he took refuge in complete silence and actually ended by turning his back on us or just about The dinner was not yet over when he stood up and left reserved and somber as one might be before an operation or an interrogation About five years ago we ran into each other in Rue Guynemer when he asked me if I was working I answered that I had lost my taste for work that I saw no need to show myself to produce and that writing was a torment for me    He seemed amazed by this and I was even more amazed when precisely with regard to writing he spoke of joy Did he actually use that word Yes I m sure of it At the same moment I recalled that at our very first meeting ten years earlier at the Closerie des Lilas he had acknowledged his great lassitude his sense that there was nothing more to be had from words    Words who has loved them as much as he They are his companions and his sole support The man relies on no certainty yet you feel that among them he stands fast His fits of discouragement doubtless coincide with the moments when he stops believing in them when he imagines they are betraying him escaping him Once they are gone he remains helpless he is nowhere I regret not having noted and listed all the places where he refers to words where he inclines toward them drops of silence through silence as they are called in The Unnameable Symbols of fragility transformed into indestructible foundations In English the French text Sans is called Lessness a word coined by Beckett as he coined the German equivalent Losigkeit This word lessness as unfathomable as Boehme s Ungrund so fascinated me that one evening I told him I would not sleep until I found an honorable French equivalent    We considered together every possible form suggested by sans and moindre None seemed to come close to the inexhaustible lessness a mixture of privation and infinity a vacuity synonymous with apotheosis We parted rather disappointed Back home I went on worrying about that poor sans Just when I was about to capitulate it occurred to me that I should try something in the direction of the Latin sine I wrote him the next day that sineite seemed to me the word we were looking for He wrote back that he had thought of it too perhaps at the same moment Yet it had to be admitted that our discovery was nothing of the kind we agreed that the search would have to be abandoned that there was no French substantive capable of expressing absence in itself absence in the pure state and that we would have to resign ourselves to the metaphysical poverty of a preposition With writers who have nothing to say who have no world of their own what can you talk about but literature With him very rarely in fact almost never Everyday subjects material difficulties problems of all kinds interest him more in conversation of course What he cannot endure in any case is questions like Do you think that suchandsuch a work will last Does soandso deserve the rank he has Between X and Y who will survive who is the greater figure Any evaluation of this kind exasperates and depresses him What s the sense in all that he exclaimed to me after one particularly painful evening when the dinnertable conversation resembled a grotesque version of the Last Judgment He himself avoids commenting on his books his plays what matters to him is not the obstacles surmounted but those to be surmounted he identifies himself totally with what he is doing If you ask him about a play he will discuss not the content the meaning but the interpretation whose slightest details he envisions minute by minute almost second by second I shall not soon forget the energy with which he explained the requirements to be satisfied by any actress who wanted to perform Not I in which only a gasping voice dominates space and replaces it How bright his eyes when he saw that tiny yet encroaching omnipresent voice It was as if he were watching the ultimate metamorphosis the supreme collapse of the Pythia Having been a cemetery buff all my life and knowing that Beckett loved them too First Love it will be recalled begins with the description of a cemetery one that happens to be in Hamburg  I spoke to him last winter on Avenue de I Observatoire of a recent visit to PereLachaise and of my indignation at not finding Proust on the list of notables buried there Let me say in passing that the first time I came across Beckett s name was some thirty years ago when I found his little book on Proust in the American Library I don t know how we came to mention Swift although on reflection the transition had nothing abnormal about it given the funereal character of his humor Beckett told me that he was rereading Gulliver and that he had a predilection for the country of the Houyhnhnms particularly for the scene where Gulliver feels such terror and disgust at the approach of a female Yahoo He told me and this was a great surprise certainly a great disappointment that Joyce didn t like Swift Moreover he added Joyce had no inclination for satire contrary to what one might think He never rebelled he was detached he accepted everything For him there was no difference between the fall of a bomb and the fall of a leaf    A marvelous judgment that in its acuteness and its strange density reminds me of how Armand Robin once answered a question I put to him Why after translating so many poets haven t you ever tried Chuangtse who has more poetry in him than all the sages I ve often thought of it he replied but how can you translate a work that is comparable only to the barren countryside of northern Scotland How many times since I ve known Beckett have I wondered an obsessive and rather stupid interrogation about his relation to his characters What do they share Who could conceive of a more radical disparity Can it be true that not only their existence but his too is steeped in that leaden light described in Malone Dies More than one of his pages seems to me a sort of monologue after the end of some cosmic epoch    The sensation of entering into a posthumous universe some geography dreamed by a demon released from everything even his own malediction Beings who do not know whether they are still alive subject to an enormous fatigue not of this world to use a language contrary to Beckett s tastes  all conceived by a man whom we guess to be vulnerable and who for decency s sake wears the mask of invulnerability not long ago I had a sudden vision of the links that bind them to their author to their accomplice What I saw then or rather what I felt I cannot translate into an intelligible formula nonetheless ever since the merest remark of one of his heroes reminds me of the inflections of a certain voice    But I hasten to add that a revelation can be as fragile and as mendacious as a theory Ever since our first encounter I have realized that he reached the limit that he perhaps began there at the impossible at the exceptional at the impasse And the admirable thing is that he has not budged that having come up against a wall from the starts he has persevered as valiant as he has always been the limitsituation as point of departure the end as advent Which accounts for the feeling that that world of his though always tottering on the verge of deaths may continue indefinitely whereas ours will soon disappear I am not especially attracted by Wittgenstein s philosophy but I have a passion for the man himself Everything I read about him has the gift of stirring me More than once I have found features he and Beckett share Two mysterious apparitions two phenomena one is glad to find so baffling so inscrutable In both the same distance from beings and things the same inflexibility the same temptation to silence to the final repudiation of the word the same will to collide with frontiers never foreseen In other ages they would have been lured by the Desert We know now that Wittgenstein at a certain point actually envisaged entering a monastery As for Beckett how easy to imagine him some centuries back in a naked cell undisturbed by the least decoration not even a crucifix Do I digress Just remember that remote enigmatic inhuman gaze of his in certain photographs Granted our beginnings matter but we make the decisive step toward ourselves only when we no longer have an origin when we offer as little substance for a biography as God    It is both important and utterly unimportant that Beckett is Irish What is dead wrong is to maintain a French assertion that he is the typical AngloSaxon Certainly nothing would displease him more Is it his bad memories of his prewar stay in London I suspect him of finding the British vulgar This verdict that he has not passed which I am passing for him as a shortcut to his reservations if not his resentments I could scarcely adopt for my own especially because a Balkan illusion perhaps the British strike me as the most devitalized and the most threatened nation hence the most refined the most civilized Beckett who oddly enough feels quite at home in France has in reality no affinity with a certain dryness an eminently French virtue or at least a Parisian one Is it not significant that he versified Chamfort Not all Chamfort of course only a few maxims The enterprise remarkable in itself and in fact almost inconceivable if we think of the absence of lyric impulse that characterizes the moralists skeletal prose  is equivalent to an avowal if not a proclamation It is always in spite of themselves that secret minds betray the depths of their nature Beckett s is so impregnated with poetry that it is inseparable from it I find him as obstinate as any fanatic Even if the world crumbled he would not abandon the work under way nor would he alter his subject In the essential things he is certainly not to be influenced As for the rest the inessential he is defenseless probably as weak as all of us even weaker than his characters    Before collecting these notes I had intended to reread what Meister Eckhart and Nietzsche wrote from their different perspectives about the noble man I have not carried out my project but I have not forgotten for a single moment that I had conceived it  Meeting the Moments IT IS NOT BY GENIUS it is by suffering by suffering only that one ceases to be a marionette When we fall under the spell of death everything occurs as if we had known death in a previous existence and as if now we were impatient to get back to it as soon as possible Once you suspect someone of having the slightest weakness for the Future you can be sure he knows the address of more than one psychiatrist Your truths make it impossible to breathe Impossible for you I immediately replied to this innocent Yet I might have wanted to add And for me too instead of swashbuckling    Man is not content to be man But he doesn t know what to revert to nor how to recover a state of which he has no clear memory His nostalgia for it is the basis of his being and it is by such nostalgia he communicates with all that remains of what is oldest in himself In the deserted church the organist was practicing No one else there except a cat that wreathed itself around me    Its eagerness was a shock the inveterate tormenting questions assailed me The organ s answer did not seem satisfying to me but in my condition it was an answer nonetheless The ideally truthful being whom we are always permitted to imagine would be someone who at any moment would not seek refuge in euphemism Unrivaled in the worship of Impassivity I have aspired to it frantically so that the more I strained to achieve it the further from it I found myself A just defeat for a man who pursues a goal contrary to his nature Man proceeds from one chaos to the next This consideration is of no consequence and keeps no one from fulfilling his destiny from acceding in short to the integral chaos Anxiety far from deriving from a nervous disequilibrium is based on the very constitution of this world and there is no reason why one should not be anxious at every moment given that time itself is merely anxiety fully expanded an anxiety whose beginning and end are indistinguishable an eternally victorious anxiety Under an incomparably desolate sky two birds indifferent to that lugubrious background pursue one another    Their obvious delight is more apt to rehabilitate an old instinct than the entire body of erotic literature Tears of admiration sole excuse for this universe since one must be found Out of solidarity with a friend who had just died I closed my eyes and let myself be flooded by that semichaos preceding sleep After a few minutes I began to realize that infinitesimal reality which still binds us to consciousness Was I on the threshold of the end A second later I was at the bottom of an abyss without the slightest trace of fear Then was nolongerexisting so simple Probably if death were only an experiment but it is The Experiment And what a notion to play with a phenomenon that occurs but once One does not test the unique The more one has suffered the less one demands To protest is a sign one has traversed no hell As if I didn t have enough troubles here I am harassed by those that must have been known to the caveman We hate ourselves because we cannot forget ourselves because we cannot think of anything else It is inevitable that we should be exasperated by this excessive preference and that we should struggle to triumph over it Yet hating ourselves is the least effective stratagem by which to manage it Music is an illusion that makes up for all the others If illusion is a term doomed to disappear I wonder what will become of me To no one is it vouchsafed in a state of neutrality to perceive the pulsation of Time To achieve this a malaise sui generis is necessary a favor proceeding from who knows where When we have glimpsed vacuity and offered sunyata a worship alternately patent and clandestine we are helpless to ally ourselves with a personal incarnated paltry god From another aspect nakedness unscathed by any presence by any human contamination scoured of the very idea of a self compromises the possibility of any worship whatever necessarily linked to a whiff of individual supremacy For as a hymn of Mahayana Buddhism has it if all things are empty who is celebrated and by whom Much more than time it is sleep that is the antidote to grief Insomnia on the other hand which enlarges the slightest vexation and converts it into a blow of fate stands vigil over our wounds and keeps them from flagging Instead of paying attention to the faces of people passing by I watched their feet and all these busy types were reduced to hurrying steps toward what And it was clear to me that our mission was to graze the dust in search of a mystery stripped of anything serious The first thing I was told by a friend who had dropped out of sight for many years though he had accumulated a stock of poisons over a long period he had not managed to kill himself because he could not decide which one to take We do not undermine our reasons for living without at the same time undermining those for writing Nonreality is an obvious matter I forget and rediscover every day So intimately does this farce become part of my existence that I cannot dissociate them Why this buffoonery of starting all over again Yet it is no such thing for by this means I belong among the livings or appear to do so Every individual as such even before actually falling has already fallen and to the antipodes of his original model How to explain that the fact of not having been that the colossal absence preceding birth seems to disturb no one and that even the person who is troubled by it is not troubled to any excessive extent According to a Chinese sage a single hour of happiness is all that a centenarian could acknowledge after carefully reflecting upon the vicissitudes of his existence    Since everyone exaggerates why should the sages constitute an exception I should like to forget everything and waken to a light before time Melancholy redeems this universe and yet it is melancholy that separates us from it To have passed one s youth at a demiurgic temperature    How many disappointments are conducive to bitterness One or a thousand depending on the subject To conceive the act of thought as a poison bath the pastime of an elegaic viper God is the conditioned creature par excellence the slave of slaves prisoner of His attributes of what He is Man on the contrary has a certain leeway insofar as he is not insofar as possessing only a borrowed existence he struggles in pseudoreality To assert itself life gives evidence of a rare ingenuity and no less to deny itself What it has invented as ways of getting rid of itself Death is far and away its greatest find its most prodigious success The clouds passed by In the silence of the night you could have heard the noise they were making as they rushed overhead Why are we here what meaning can our infinitesimal presence have Questions without answers though I reply spontaneously without the shadow of reflection and without blushing at uttering such a distinguished banality It is in order to torment ourselves that we are here and for no other reason Had I been informed that my moments like all the rest were going to abandon me I should have felt neither fear nor regret nor joy Flawless absence Every personal accent had vanished from what I thought I was still feeling but in truth I was feeling nothing I was surviving my own sensations and yet I was not a living dead man I was alive but as one is seldom alive as one is alive only once To frequent the Desert Fathers and yet to be moved by the latest news In the first centuries of our era I would have belonged among those eremites of whom it is said that after a certain time they were wearied with seeking God Though we ourselves have come too late we shall be envied by our immediate successors and still more by our remote descendants In their eyes we shall have the look of privileged characters and rightly so for everyone wants to be as far as possible from the future Let no one enter if he has spent a single day in stupor s refuge Our place is somewhere between being and nonbeing between two fictions The other it must be confessed seems to us more or less of a lunatic We follow him only up to a point after that he necessarily strays since even his most legitimate concerns strike us as unjustified inexplicable Never ask language to furnish an effort out of proportion to its natural capacity in any case do not force it to yield its maximum Let us avoid all extravagance with words lest bewildered they can no longer bear the burden of a meaning No thought more corrosive nor more reassuring than the thought of death Doubtless it is because of this double quality that we brood over it to the point of being unable to do without it What luck to meet up in one and the same moment with a poison and a remedy a revelation that kills yet gives life a roborant venom After the Goldberg Variations superessential music to employ the mystical jargon we close our eyes giving ourselves up to the echo they have raised within us Nothing more exists except a plenitude without content which is indeed the sole way of approaching the Supreme To attain deliverance we must believe that everything is real or else that nothing is But we distinguish only degrees of reality things strike us as more or less true more or less in being And so it is that we never know where we are To trace back to the sovereign zero out of which emerges that subaltern zero that constitutes ourselves    The Serious is not quite an attribute of existence the Tragic is for it implies a notion of gratuitous disaster whereas the Serious suggests a minimum of finality And the charm of existence is that it allows of none Each of us passes through his Promethean crisis and all we do afterward is revel in or revile that past To exhibit a skull in a showcase already a challenge a whole skeleton a scandal After even the most furtive glance how will the passing wretch attend to his affairs and in what mood will the poor lover proceed to his assignation With all the more reason a prolonged halt before our ultimate metamorphosis can only discourage desire and delirium    And thus it is that as I walked away there was nothing for me to do but curse that vertical horror and its uninterrupted sneer When the bird of sleep thought to nest in my pupils it saw the lashes and fled in fear of the net Who better than this Ben alHamara an Arab poet of Andalusia has perceived the unfathomability of insomnia Those moments when a memory or even less is enough to slip out of the world Even as a runner who stops in the heat of the race trying to understand the meaning of it all to meditate is an admission that one is winded Enviable form of renown to attach our name like our first ancestor to mud that will dazzle the generations of men What is impermanent is suffering what is suffering is nonself What is nonself is not mine I am not that that is not I Samyutta Nikaya  What is suffering is nonself It is difficult it is impossible to agree with Buddhism on this point crucial though it is For us suffering is what is most ourselves most self What a strange religion It sees suffering everywhere yet at the same time declares it to be unreal On his countenance not a trace of mockery remaining It is because he had an almost sordid attachment to life Those who have not deigned to cling to it wear a scornful smile sign of deliverance and of triumph They are not going into nothingness they have left it behind Before his serious health problems he was a scholar since    he has fallen into metaphysics To be accessible to that essential divagation the cooperation of loyal miseries is necessary those eager to recur To have borne the Himalayas all night long and to call that sleep What sacrifice would I not make in order to be free of this wretched self which at this very moment occupies within the All a place no god has dared aspire to It takes an enormous humility to die The strange thing is that everyone turns out to have it These waves and their sempiternal prattle are eclipsed in futility by the yet more inept trepidation of the city If you close your eyes and let yourself sink beneath this double rumbling you imagine yourself present at the sketches for the Creation and you rapidly lose your way in cosmogonie lucubrations Wonder of wonders no interval between the first agitation and this unnameable point we have reached Every form of progress is a perversion in the sense that being is a perversion of nonbeing You may have endured insomnias of which a martyr would be jealous but if they have not marked your features no one will believe you Without witnesses you will continue to seem some kind of joker and acting the part better than anyone you yourself will be the first accomplice of the incredulous Proof that a generous action goes against nature it provokes sometimes immediately sometimes months or years later an uneasiness one dares not admit to anyone even to oneself At that funeral service everything was shadow and dream and dust returning to dust Then without transition the deceased was promised eternal joy and all that follows from it So much inconsistency vexed me and I forsook both the Greek Orthodox pope and the latelamented As I left I could not help thinking that I was in no position to protest against those who so ostensibly contradict themselves What a relief to throw into the garbage a manuscript witness of a fallen fever of a disconcerting frenzy This morning I thought hence lost my bearings for a good quarter of an hour Everything that inconveniences us allows us to define ourselves Without indispositions no identity the luck and misfortune of a conscious organism If to describe a misery were as easy as to live through it Daily lesson in reserve to realize if only for the wink of an eye that one day people will speak of our remains People insist on the diseases of the will they forget that the will as such is suspect and that it is not normal to will After having palavered for hours I am invaded by the void By the void and by shame Is it not indecent to display one s secrets to proffer one s very being to tell and to tell oneself whereas the fullest moments of one s life have been known in silence in the perception of silence As an adolescent Turgenev tacked to his bedroom wall a portrait of FouquierTinville Youths always and everywhere has idealized executioners provided they perform their task in the name of the vague and the bombastic Life and death have little enough content the one as well as the other Unfortunately we always know this too late when it can no longer help us either to live or to die You are calm you forget your enemy who meanwhile watches and waits Yet there is every reason to be ready when he attacks You will triumph for he will be weakened by that enormous consumption of energy his hatred Of all things one feels nothing gives the impression of being at the very heart of truth so much as fits of unaccountable despair compared to these everything seems frivolous debased lacking in substance and interest Weariness independent of the organs wear and tear timeless weariness for which no palliative exists and over which no rest even the last can triumph    Everything is salutary save to question ourselves moment by moment as to the meaning of our actions everything is preferable to the only question that matters Having once been concerned with Joseph de Maistre instead of explaining the figure by accumulating details I should have recalled that he managed to sleep only three hours a night at the most This suffices to account for the extravagances of a thinker or of anyone at all Yet I had neglected to observe the phenomenon an all the more unforgivable omission in that human beings are divided into sleepers and makers two specimens of beings forever heterogeneous with nothing but their physical aspect in common We should really breathe better if one fine day we were told that the quasitotality of our kind had evaporated as if by magic You must have powerful religious dispositions in order to utter with conviction the word being you must believe simply to say about an object or about someone that it or he is Every season is an ordeal nature changes and renews herself only in order to scourge us At the source of the least thought appears a slight disequilibrium What then are we to say about the kind from which thought itself proceeds If in primitive societies the old are disposed of a little too readily in civilized ones on the other hand they are flattered and overfed The future no doubt about it will retain only the first model Though you abandon all religious or political faith you will preserve the tenacity and the intolerance that impelled you to adopt it You will still be in a rage but your rage will be directed against the abandoned belief fanaticism linked to your very essence will persist there independent of the convictions you can defend or reject The basis your basis remains the same and it is not by changing opinions that you will manage to modify it The Zohar puts us in a quandary if it is telling the truth the poor man presents himself before God with only his soul while the others have nothing to offer but their bodies Given the impossibility of making a choice best to keep on waiting Do not confuse talent and verve Most often verve will characterize the charlatan From another point of view without it how give any spice to our truths to our errors Not a moment when I am not incredulous at finding myself in just that moment Out of dozens of our dreams only one has any meaning and even then The rest discards simplistic or vomitive literature imagery of sickly genius The dreams that are longdrawnout testify to the indigence of the dreamer who cannot see how to conclude and struggles unsuccessfully to find a denouement just as in the theater the playwright multiplies peripeties not knowing how and where to stop My problems or rather my pains follow a policy that is beyond me Sometimes they are concerted and advance together sometimes each goes its own way very often they oppose each other but whether they agree or dispute they behave as if their maneuvers had nothing to do with me as if I were merely their flabbergasted spectator Only what we have not accomplished and what we could not accomplish matters to us so that what remains of a whole life is only what it will not have been To dream of an enterprise of demolition that would spare none of the traces of the original Big Bang  SaintJohn Perse BUT WHAT IS THIS oh What is it in each thing that suddenly falls short No sooner is the question asked than the poet dismayed by the evident sources from which it rises as though from the abyss to which it leads  turns against it and wages in order to compromise it to destroy its insidious authority a battle whose details and vicissitudes we do not know as we do not know what secrets this abstract confidence conceals There is no history save of the soul Reluctant to divulge his history he condemns us to guess or to construct it hides behind the very avowals to which he assents and does not intend us to touch the pure keys of his exile Impenetrable out of a certain modesty anything but inclined to the abdications of limpidity the compromises of transparency he has multiplied his masks and if he has enlarged himself beyond the immediate and the finite past that intelligibility which is limit and acquiescence to limit it is not in order to espouse the Vague poetic prelude to vacuity but to haunt Being his sole means of escaping the terror of insolvency the flashing perception of what in each thing falls short Rarely given almost always conquered Being well deserves the honor of a capital letter in this case the conquest is so brilliant that it seems to emanate from a revelation rather than from a process or a struggle whence the frequent surprises the sensation of the instantaneous And suddenly everything is power and presence for me there where the theme of nothingness is smoking still The sea itself like a sudden ovation    Aside from the abyssal interrogation quoted above emphasis is laid on the sudden on the unforeseen so as to mark the emergence and the sovereignty of the positive the transfiguration of the inanimate victory over the void To have celebrated Exile to have replaced the I as much as possible by the Stranger yet to come to terms with the world to find anchorage there to become its spokesman such is the paradox of a continually triumphant lyricism in which each word inclines toward the thing it translates so as to bring it level with an apparently undeserved order so as to hoist it up to the miracle of a nevervanquished Yes and to enfold it in a hymn to diversity to the iridescent image of the One An erudite and virgin lyricism concerted and original produced from a knowledge of lifefluids from a learned intoxication with the elements preSocratic and antibiblical a lyricism that calls sacred everything capable of bearing a name everything over which language that true savior can have a hold To justify things is to baptize them is to wrest them from their darkness their anonymity insofar as he succeeds he will love them all even that golgotha of ordure and rust the modern city The recourse however ironic to Christian terminology has a strange effect in a fundamentally pagan work At once emanation and exegesis of a demiurge the Poem which in Perse s vision proceeds as much from cosmogony as from literature is elaborated like a universe it engenders enumerates compares the elements and incorporates them into its nature The Poem is closed subsisting in and of itself yet open a whole mute nation rises in my words  restive yet subjugated autonomous yet dependent as attached to expression as it is to the expressed to the subject that savors itself and to the subject that records the poem is ecstasy and enumeration inventory and absolute Sometimes merely responding to its formal aspects and forgetting that it sounds reality we are tempted to read it as if it were no more than the glamour of its music as if it corresponded to nothing objective nothing perceptible Beautiful all right like Sanskrit our passive and enchanted ego exclaims capitulating to the voluptuous delights of language as such But this language once again adheres to the object and reflects its appearances The space it delights in is that Raum der Ruhmung dear to Rilke that space of celebration in which reality never unfulfilled tends toward a surplus of being in which each thing participates in the Supreme because nothing falls under the curse of the Interchangeable source of negation and cynicism Existence is legitimate and valuable only if we are capable of discerning at whatever level even that of the infinitesimal the presence of the irreplaceable If we fail we reduce the spectacle of process to a series of equivalences and simulacra to a play of appearances against a background of identity We imagine ourselves clearsighted and doubtless we are but our perspicacity by dint of making us waver between the futile and the funereal ends by plunging us into fruitless ruminations in the abuse of irony and the complacencies of denial Despairing of ever being able to confer upon our imprecise animosities the density of venom and moreover weary of laboring over the invalidation of Being we turn to those who engaged in the enterprise of praise superior to the shadows exempt from the superstition of negation dare consent to everything because for them everything counts everything is irreparably unique The Poem will celebrate precisely uniqueness not that of the passing moment an inconsequence but the uniqueness in which the eternal exception of each thing is deployed In that epoch of celebration there is only one dimension the present limitless duration that enfolds the ages a moment at once immemorial and actual Are we in this age Or at the dawn of Greece or China Nothing more illegitimate than to bring chronological scruples to a work and an author blessedly unscathed by them Like the Poem Perse is a contemporary a timeless one I shall be there among the very first for the irruption of the new god We feel ourselves that he has already witnessed both advent and twilight of the old gods and that if he anticipates others he does so not as a prophet but as a mind in which reminiscence and presentiment far from taking opposite paths unite and coincide Closer to oracle than to dogma an initiate by energy and attitude by what we might call his Delphic aspect  he espouses no specific cult how condescend to the god of others how share him with them For all that he idolizes words converting their fiction into essence the poet creates a private mythology his own Olympus which he populates and depopulates at will a privilege he is granted by language whose proper role and final function is to engender and destroy the gods No more than he affects any specific period the Stranger of the Poem takes root in no country He seems to traverse some empire celebrating an inexhaustible festivity The human beings he encounters there and their customs doubtless attract him though less than the elements Even in books he will seek the wind and the thought of the wind and more than the wind the sea invested with the attributes and advantages ordinarily enjoyed by divinity unity restored light made substance for us Being surprised in its essence luminous instance    In its infinite productivity in many respects does it not evoke the Night of the romantics  the sea will be an Absolute arrayed a fathomless wonder yet a visible one revelation of a bottomless appearance The Poem will have as its mission to imitate the sea s undulation and brilliance to suggest its perfection in incompletion to be or to seem a swirling eternity coexistence of the past and the possible within a Becoming without succession a duration that endlessly falls back upon itself Neither historical nor tragic Perse s vision emancipated from both terror and nostalgia partakes of the Tremor of that tonic shudder of a mind that has built upon the abyss instead of falling into it and cultivating its pangs No predilection here for panic but the ecstasy that triumphs over vacuity the sensuality of awe From his universe in which the flesh acquires a metaphysical status  evil is banished and good as well for here existence finds its justification in itself Truly When the poet has doubts when he cannot sound Beingas he might the sea then he turns to language in order to study its great erosions to explore its depths the old layers Immersion complete he surfaces again to utter like the waves one long unstopped sentence forever unintelligible Were a single meaning to be attached to work it would be condemned without appeal stripped of that halo of indeterminacy and ambiguity which flatters and multiplies its commentators it collapses in the woes of clarity and ceasing to dismay suffers the dishonor reserved for the obvious If the work would avoid the humiliation of being understood it must by a certain dosage of the unimpeachable and the obscure by attention to the equivocal provoke divergent interpretations and perplexed fervors those symptoms of vitality those guarantees of lasting It is lost once it permits the commentator to know at what level of reality it is located and of what world it is the reflection The author no less than the work must dissimulate his identity yield everything of himself except the essential persevere in his enchantment and his solitude a sovereign subservient to his words their dazzled slave Even so evident a master of words as Perse we cannot help feeling suffers their despotism which in his fascination he identifies with the elements even with the elemental with the caprices and commands from which he can never escape This impression may be corrected by another contrary one every bit as legitimate the more we read him the more we discern in Perse the dimension of a legislator impatient to codify the vague and the impalpable to call words to order     to wrest them from their anarchy or rouse them from their torpor in order to send them to our aid charged with salubrious and vivifying truths Antithetical to a Valery or an Eliot Ash Wednesday is the exact antipodes of the world of Perse  he avoids insisting on the purity of Nonbeing or on the infirm glory of the positive hour and when he invokes death it is to denounce its immense pomps not to exploit its magic A poet in his complicity his affinity with beings and with things he neither regrets nor condemns that original rupture which swept them out of unity into a procession anything but funereal according to him actually blessed since it provoked that parade of the multiple of the patent and the strange whose exhaustive accounting he undertakes Everything one sees deserves to be seen whatever exists is incurably existent he seems to be telling us while in a trance in the vertigo of plenitude in an orgiastic appetite for reality he labors to fill to cram the void without inflicting upon it that scourge of opacity and gravitation which discredits matter There are poets whose help we seek in our willtowane we want them to encourage our gainsaying to aggravate our stupor our vice They are irresistible marvelously debilitating    There are other poets more difficult of access because they do not espouse our rancors and our obsessions Mediators in the conflict that sets us against the world they invite us to acceptance to an effort over the ego    When we are overcome by ourselves and still more by our cries when that eminently modern craving to protest and to assert our rights assumes the gravity of a sin what a comfort to encounter a mind that never falls into such ways that retreats from the vulgarity of revolt like a man of antiquity of both heroic antiquity and waning antiquity like Pindar or even like Marcus Aurelius who exclaimed Whatever the hours bring me is a flavorsome fruit O Nature In Perse there is a note of lyric sagesse a superb litany of contentment an apotheosis of necessity and expression of fate and of the word just as there is without the slightest Christian accent a visionary side And the star of no nation climbs into the heights of the green age do we not seem to be reading some verses of a serene variant of the Apocalypse Were the universe to vanish nothing would be lost since language would immediately take its place If just one word a simple word were to survive the general engulfment it would in itself defy nothingness Such is the conclusion the Poem implies and demands   Exasperations AT TWO in the afternoon rowing on the etang de Soustons I was suddenly thunderstruck by the recollection of a phrase All is of no avail Had I been alone I should have flung myself into the water then and there Never have I felt with such violence the necessity of putting an end to it all Devouring biographies one after the next to be convinced of the futility of any undertaking of any destiny I run into X I would have given anything in the world never to encounter him again To have to endure such specimens While he talked I was inconsolable not to possess a supernatural power that could annihilate both of us on the spot This body what use is it if not to make us understand the meaning of the word torturer An acute sense of absurdity makes the merest action unlikely indeed impossible Lucky those who lack such a thing Providence has looked out for them At an exhibit of Oriental art a manyheaded Brahma irritated sullen besotted to the last degree It is in this attitude that I enjoy seeing representations of the god of gods Out of patience with them all But I like to laugh And I cannot laugh alone Never having known what I was after in this world I am still waiting for someone to tell me what he himself pursues Asked why the monks who followed him were so    radiant Buddha answered that it was because they thought neither of the past nor of the future We turn gloomy in fact whenever we contemplate either one and worse than gloomy whenever we contemplate both Counterirritant to desolation close your eyes for a long while in order to forget light and all that it reveals When a writer passes himself off as a philosopher you can be sure he does so in order to camouflage any number of deficiencies Ideas a screen that hides nothing In admiration as in envy the eyes suddenly light up How to distinguish one from the other in those we are uncertain about He calls me in the middle of the night to tell me he can t sleep I give him a good lecture on this variety of disaster which is in reality disaster itself At the end I am so pleased with my performance that I go back to bed feeling like a hero proud to confront the hours separating me from daylight The publication of a book involves the same kinds of problems as a marriage or a funeral Never write about anyone I am so convinced of this that each time I am inclined to do so my first thought is to attach even if I admire him the person of whom I am to speak And God saw that the light was good such is the opinion of mortals with the exception of the sleepless for whom it is an aggression a new inferno more pitiless than the night s There comes a moment when negation itself loses its luster and much deteriorated goes down the drain with appearances According to Louis de Broglie there is a relation between faire de l esprit and making scientific discoveries esprit here signifying the capacity spontaneously to establish unexpected comparisons If this were so the Germans would be incapable of innovating with regard to the sciences Swift himself was amazed that a nation of dullards should have so great a number of inventions to its credit but invention does not suppose agility so much as perseverance the capacity to explore to penetrate to persist    The spark is struck by obstinacy Nothing is tiresome for a man swept on by the craving for investigation Proof against boredom he will expatiate endlessly about anything without sparing if he is a writer his readers without even deigning if he is a philosopher to take them into consideration I tell an American psychoanalyst that while on a friend s property I happened to take a bad fall while I was doing some of my inveterate pruning struggling with the dry branches of a sequoia You were struggling with that tree not to prune it but to punish it for outliving you Your secret desire was to take revenge by stripping it of its branches Enough to disgust one forever with any deep explanation Another Yankee this time a professor was complaining that he didn t know what he would discuss in his next year s lectures Why not chaos and its charms I don t know about that I ve never been subject to that kind of spell he replied Easier to reach an understanding with a monster than with the contrary of a monster I was reading Rimbaud Le Bateau ivre to someone who didn t know the poem and who moreover was a stranger to poetry itself It sounds as if it came from the tertiary age was his comment once I had finished reading As judgments go not bad P Tz a genius if ever there was one Oral frenzy out of a horror or an impossibility of writing Scattered through the Balkans thousands and thousands of quips lost forever How to give a notion of his verve his passion his madness You re a mixture of God and Quixote I told him once At the time he was flattered but the next morning very early he came to tell me I don t like that business about Don Quixote From the age of ten to the age of fourteen I lived in a boarding house Every morning on my way to school passing a bookstore I would glance at the books which were changed relatively often even in this provincial Rumanian town Only one in the corner of the shop window seemed to have been forgotten for months Bestia umana Zola s Human Beast  Of those four years the only memory that haunts me is that title My books my work the grotesquerie of such possessives Everything was spoiled once literature stopped being anonymous Decadence dates from the first author I had decided never again to shake hands with anyone healthy Yet I have had to compromise for I soon discovered that many of those I suspected of wellbeing were less subject to it than I had supposed What was the use of making enemies on the basis of mere suspicions Nothing so hampers continuity of thought as to feel the mind s insistent pressure Perhaps this is why the mad think only in flashes That man in the street what does he want Why is he alive And that child and its mother and that old man No one finds favor in my eyes during this accursed promenade At last I went into a butcher shop where something like half a calf s carcass was hanging At the sight I was quite ready to burst into tears In my fits of rage I feel vexatiously close to Saint Paul My affinities with the frantic with all whom I detest    who has ever so resembled his antipodes Looming up out of a sort of primordial Ineffectually    Just now trying to contend with a serious subject and failing altogether I went to bed How frequently have my plans led me to this predestined term of all my ambitions There is always someone above you beyond God Himself rises Nothingness To perish that verb which is my favorite and which oddly enough suggests nothing irreparable Whenever I have to meet someone I am overcome with such a craving for isolation that when I am about to speak  I lose all control over my words and their somersaulting is taken for    verve This universe so magisterially miscarried as one keeps telling onself when one happens to be in a concessive mood Braggadocio and physical pain do not go together As soon as our carcass makes itself known we are brought back to our normal dimensions to the most mortifying  the most devastating certitude What an incitation to hilarity hearing the word goal while following a funeral procession We have always been dying and yet death has lost none of its freshness its originality Herein lies the secret of secrets To read is to let someone else work for you the most delicate form of exploitation Anyone who quotes us from memory and incorrectly is a saboteur who should be taken to court A garbled quotation is equivalent to a betrayal an insult a prejudice all the more serious in that the intention was to do us a favor The tormented who are they if not martyrs embittered by not knowing for whose sake to immolate themselves To think is to submit to the whims and commands of an uncertain health Having begun my day with Meister Eckhart I then turned to Epicurus And the day is not yet over with whom shall I end it Once I emerge from the I I put myself to sleep Who does not believe in Fate proves he has not lived If I should ever happen to die one of these days    A middleaged woman passing me on the street took it into her head to announce without looking at me Today I see nothing but walking corpses wherever I look Then still without looking at me she added I m crazy aren t I Monsieur Not all that crazy I replied with a glance of complicity To see in every baby a future Richard III    At every age of our life we discover that life is a mistake Only at fifteen is this a revelation that combines a shudder of fear and a touch of enchantment With time this revelation degenerating turns into to a truism and thus we come to regret the period when it was a source of the unforeseen In the spring of  as I was walking on the grounds of the psychiatric hospital of Sibiu in Transylvania a pensioner approached me We exchanged a few words and then I said to him It s pleasant here I know it s worth the trouble of being crazy he replied But still you are in a sort of prison If you like but we live here quite without anxiety Besides there s a war coming you know that as well as I do And this is a safe place We won t be called up and they never bomb insane asylums If I were you I d get myself committed right away Troubled amazed I left him and tried to find out something more about my interlocutor I was assured that he was genuinely mad Mad or not no one has ever given me more reasonable advice It is flawed humanity that constitutes the substance of literature The writer congratulates himself upon Adam s perversity and prospers only to the degree that each of us assumes and renews it As for biological patrimony the merest innovation is it would seem a disaster Life is conservative and flourishes only through repetition through cliche through formula Just the contrary of art Ghenghis Khan took along the greatest Taoist sage of his time on all of his expeditions Extreme cruelty is rarely vulgar it always has something strange and refined about it that inspires fear and respect William the Conqueror as pitiless to his allies as he was to his enemies liked only wild beasts and dark forests where he would always walk alone I was about to go out when in order to tie my scarf I glanced at myself in the mirror Suddenly an unspeakable terror who is that Impossible to recognize myself Though I had no trouble identifying my overcoat my necktie my hat I couldn t make out who I was for I was not myself that was not me This lasted a certain number of seconds twenty thirty forty When I managed to come to my senses the terror persisted I had to wait for it to consent to disappear An oyster to build up its shell must pass its weight in seawater through its body fifty thousand times    Where have I turned for my lessons in patience Read somewhere the statement God speaks only of Himself On this specific pointy the Almighty has more than one rival To be or not to be    Neither one nor the other Each time I happen upon even the merest sentence of Buddhist lore I am overcome by a desire to return to that wisdom which I have tried to absorb for quite a long period of time and which inexplicably I have partially forsaken In that wisdom abides not so much truth as something better still    and it is by that wisdom we accede to the state where we are purified of all things of illusions first of all No longer to have any such things yet not to risk ruin to sink into disillusion while avoiding bitterness to be a little more emancipated every day from the obnubilation in which these living hordes languish    To die is to change genre to renew oneself    Beware of thinkers whose minds function only when they are fueled by a quotation If relations between men are so difficulty it is because men have been created to knock each other down and not to have relations Conversation with him was as conventional as with a dying man Ceasing to exist signifies nothings can signify nothing What is the use of being concerned with what survives a nonreality with a semblance that succeeds another semblance Death is in fact nothing it is at most a simulacrum of mystery like life itself Antimetaphysical propaganda of the graveyards In my childhood there was one figure I could never forget a peasant who having just inherited some money went from tavern to tavern followed by a musician A splendid summer day the whole village was in the fields he alone accompanied by his violinist wandered the empty streets humming some tune After two years he was as poor as before But the gods were kind he died soon after Without knowing why I was fascinated and rightly so When I think of him now I still believe he was really someone of all the inhabitants of the village he alone had enough imagination to ruin his life Longing to yell to spit in people s faces to drag them along the ground to trample them  I have trained myself to decency in order to humble my rage and my rage takes revenge as often as it can If I were asked to summarize as briefly as possible my vision of things to reduce it to its most succinct expression I should replace words with an exclamation point a definitive Doubt creeps in everywhere with however a signal exception there is no skeptical music Demosthenes copied out Thucydides eight times That is how you learn a language One ought to have the courage to transcribe all the books one loves That someone should detest what we do we tolerate more or less But if someone disdains a book we have recommended to him that is much more serious and it wounds us like an underhanded attack For then it is our taste that is called into question and even our discernment When I observe how I slide into sleep I have the impression of sinking into a providential abyss of falling into it for eternity without ever being able to escape Moreover no desire to escape even touches me What I desire in such moments is to perceive them as clearly as possible to lose nothing of them and to enjoy them until the last before unconsciousness before beatitude The last important poet of Rome Juvenal and the last decisive writer of Greece Lucian both labored in irony Two literatures that ended thus as everything literature or not ought to end This return to the inorganic ought not to affect us in any fashion Yet so lamentable not to say so laughable a phenomenon makes cowards of us all It is time to rethink death to imagine a less mediocre downfall Astray here on earth as I would doubtless be astray anywhere There cannot be pure sentiments between those who follow similar paths One need merely recall the glances we cast at each other when we share the same sidewalk One grasps incomparably more things in boredom than by labor effort being the mortal enemy of meditation To shift from scorn to detachment seems easy enough Yet this is not so much a transition as a feat an accomplishment Scorn is the first victory over the world detachment the last the supreme The interval separating them is identified with the path leading from liberty to liberation I have never met one deranged mind that lacked curiosity about God Are we to conclude from this that there exists a link between the search for the absolute and the disaggregation of the brain Any maggot to regard itself as first among its peers would immediately assume the status of man If everything were to be erased from my mind except the traces of what I have known as unique where would these come from if not from the thirst for nonexistence How many missed opportunities to compromise myself with God Overwhelming joy if extended is closer to madness than is the persistent melancholy which justifies itself by reflection and even by mere observation whereas joy s excesses derive from some derangement If it is disconcerting to be happy over the mere fact of being alive it is quite normal on the other hand to be sad even before learning baby talk The luck of the novelist or the playwright to express himself by disguising himself to release himself from his conflicts and still more from all those characters brawling within himself Things turn out otherwise for the essayist faced with a problematic genre into which he projects his own incompatibilities only by contradicting himself at every step One is freer in the aphorism triumph of a disintegrated ego    I am thinking at this moment of someone whom I used to admire unreservedly who kept none of his promises and who by disappointing all those who believed in him died in a virtual paroxysm of satisfaction Language compensates for the inadequacy of remedies and cures most of our diseases The chatterbox does not haunt pharmacies Stupefying lack of necessity life improvisation fantasy of matter ephemeral chemistry    Love s great and sole originality is to make happiness indistinct from misery Letters letters to write This one for instance    but I cannot do it I suddenly feel myself incapable of lying On this estate dedicated like its manor house to the crackbrained enterprises of charity everywhere one looks there are old women kept alive by virtue of surgical operations There was a time when one died at home in the dignity of solitude and desertion now the moribund are collected crammed and their indecent throes extended as long as possible No sooner have we lost one defect than another presses forward to take its place Such is the price of our equilibrium Words have become so external to me that making contact with them assumes the proportions of a feat We have nothing more to say to one another and if I employ them still it is to denounce them while secretly deploring an everimminent rupture At the Luxembourg a woman of about forty almost elegant but with a certain bizarre look about her was speaking in an affectionate even impassioned tone to someone who was not to be seen As I caught up with her I noticed that she was clutching a marmoset to her bosom She then sat down on a bench where she continued her monologue with the same intensity The first words I heard as I passed her were You know I ve had about enough I walked on not knowing whom to pity more her or her confidant That man is going to disappear has been heretofore my firm conviction But now I ve changed my mind he must disappear Aversion to all that is human is compatible with pity I should even say that these reactions are interdependent but not simultaneous Only someone who knows the former is capable of intensely experiencing the latter Just now the sensation of being the last version of the Universe worlds revolved around me yet I felt not the slightest trace of disequilibrium only something far above what it is licit to experience Waking with a start wondering if the word sense has any meaning then astounded not to be able to fall asleep again It is characteristic of pain not to be ashamed of repeating itself To that very old friend who informs me of his decision to put an end to his days I reply that he mustn t be in any hurry that the game s ending is not without a charm of its own and that one can even come to terms with the Intolerable provided one never forgets that everything is a bluff a bluff that generates torments    He worked and produced he flung himself into massive generalizations astonished by his own fecundity He was quite ignorant fortunately for him of the nightmare of nuance To exist is a deviation so patent that it acquires thereby the prestige of a longedfor infirmity To recognize in oneself all the vile instincts of which one is ashamed    If they are so energetic in someone who strives to be rid of them how much more virulent must they be in those who lacking a minimum of lucidity will never manage to be on their guard and still less to loathe themselves In the heat of success or of failure remember how we were conceived Incomparable recipe for triumphing over euphoria or discontent Only the plant approaches wisdom the animal is unsuited to it As for man    Nature should have stopped with the vegetable kingdom instead of disqualifying herself by a craving for the extraordinary The young and the old and the others too all odious they can be brought to heel only by flattery which ends by making them more odious still Heaven is open to no one    it will open only after the disappearance of the world Tertullian  One is speechless that after such a warning we have continued our agitation Of what obstinancy is history the fruit Dorotea von RoddeSchloezer accompanying her husband the mayor of Lubeck to Napoleon s coronation wrote There are so many madmen on earth and especially in France that it is child s play for this Corsican prestidigitator to make them dance like marionettes to the sound of his pipe They all fling themselves after this rat charmer and no one asks where he is leading them Periods of expansion are periods of delirium periods of decadence and recession are by comparison reasonable even too reasonable and that is why they are almost as deadly as the others Opinions yes convictions no That is the point of departure for an intellectual pride We are all the more attached to someone when his instinct for selfpreservation is ambivalent not to say obliterated Lucretius we know nothing specific about his life Specific Not even vague An enviable destiny Nothing comparable to the onset of depression at the moment of waking It takes one back billions of years back to the first signs to the prodromes of Being indeed back to the very principle of depression You have no need to end up on the Cross for you were born crucified December    What would I not give to recall what could have provoked a despair so overweening We recall Pascal s frenzy in The Provincial Letters over the casuist Escobar who according to a French traveler visiting him on the Iberian peninsula knew nothing of these attacks Further Pascal was scarcely known in his own country Misunderstanding and unreality wherever one looks So many friends and enemies who showed an equal interest in us vanished one after the next What a relief To be able to let oneself go at last no longer having to fear their censure or their disappointment To pass irreconcilable judgments upon anything including death is the sole manner of not cheating According to Asanga and his school the triumph of good over evil is merely a victory of maya over maya similarly putting an end to transmigration by illumination is like a king of illusion vanquishing a king of illusion Mahayanasutralamkara  These Hindus have had the audacity to set illusion so high to make it a substitute for self and world and to convert it into the supreme given Remarkable conversion ultimate and inescapable stage What is to be done Every extremity even liberation being an impasse how to escape in order to catch up with the Possible Perhaps one must lower the terms of the debate endow things with a shadow of reality restrain the hegemony of clearsightedness dare to maintain that everything that seems to exist does exist in its way and then weary of wandering off the pointy change the subject     Mircea Eliade I FIRST MET ELIADE around  in Bucharest where I had just finished some sort of studies in philosophy He was at that time the idol of the new generation a magic formula we were proud to invoke We scorned the old the dodderers anyone over thirty Our intellectual leader waged a campaign against them he demolished them one by one striking almost always to the heart I say almost because occasionally he missed his aim as when he attacked Tudor Arghezi a great poet whose only fault was to be acclaimed consecrated  The struggle between generations seemed to us the key to every conflict and the explanatory principle of every event To be young for us was automatically to have genius Such infatuation it will be said is universal No doubt But I don t think it was ever carried so far as it was with us in it was expressed was exacerbated a determination to force History an appetite to find our place within it and to affect the New at any price Frenzy was the order of the day In whom was it embodied In someone who had returned from India from the country that has always and specifically turned its back on History on chronology on Becoming as such I should not point out this paradox if it did not testify to a profound duality to a character trait in Eliade equally solicited by essence and by accident the timeless and the quotidian mysticism and literature This duality involves no laceration for him it is his nature and his luck to be able to live simultaneously or alternately on different spiritual levels to ponder ecstasy and pursue anecdotes without making a fuss In the period when I knew him I was already amazed that he could be studying Sankhya about which he had just published a long article and also be interested in the latest novel Subsequently I have never failed to be amazed by the spectacle of a curiosity so immense and so intense in anyone else it would be morbid He has nothing of the grim and perverse obstinacy of the maniac of the obsessive who limits himself to a single realm to a single sector and rejects all the rest as secondary and trivial The one obsession I recognize in him and in truth it has diminished with the years is that of the polygraph the universal writer hence of the antiobsessive par excellence since he is eager to fling himself upon any subject in his unquenchable thirst for exploration Nicolas Iorga the Rumanian historian an extraordinary figure fascinating and dismaying the author of over a thousand works that in places are extremely lively but in general are confused poorly constructed unreadable shot through with flashes of wit smothered in tedium in those days Eliade admired him passionately the way one admires the elements a forest the sea the fields fecundity itself everything that burgeons proliferates erupts and asserts itself The superstition of vitality and productivity especially in literature has never left him I may be speaking out of turn here but I have every reason to believe that in his unconscious he sets books above the gods more than to the latter it is to books that he addresses his worship In any case I have met no one who loved them so much as he I shall never forget the fever with which arriving in Paris just after the liberation he touched them caressed them leafed through them in bookstores he exulted he officiated it was something like enchantment idolatry So much enthusiasm presupposes a great depth of generosity a defect of which one cannot determine the profusion the exuberance the prodigality all qualities thanks to which the mind imitates and exceeds nature I have never been able to read Balzac to tell the truth I stopped trying on the threshold of adolescence His world is closed to me inaccessible I never manage to enter it I am refractory to it How many times has Eliade tried to convert me He first read the Comedie humaine in Bucharest he reread it in Paris in  perhaps he is rereading it in Chicago now He has always loved ample exuberant novels that unfold on several levels accompanying the endless melody the massive presence of time the accumulation of details and the abundance of complex and divergent themes on the other hand he has no use for anything in letters that is exercise the anemic and refined games aesthetes play the overripe faisande aspect of certain productions lacking in instinct and in juice But one can also explain his passion for Balzac in another way There are two kinds of minds those that love process and those that love the result The first are attached to the unfolding the stages the successive expressions of thought or of action the second to the final expression except for which nothing matters By temperament I have always been inclined toward the latter toward a Chamfort a Joubert a Lichtenberg who give you a formula without revealing the path that has led them to it Whether out of modesty or out of sterility they cannot free themselves from the superstition of concision they want to say everything in a page a phrase a word sometimes they succeed though rarely it must be said laconism must resign itself to silence if it wants to avoid a fake enigmatic profundity Still when one lives this quintessentialized or sclerotic form of expression it is difficult to wrest oneself away from it and to care much for any other variety He who has frequented the moralists for a long time will have difficulty understanding Balzac but he can divine the reasons of those who have a great weakness for him who derive from his universe a sensation of life of expansion of freedom unknown to the lover of maxims a minor genre in which perfection is identified with asphyxia However distinct Eliade s taste for huge syntheses it is just as clear that he might also have excelled in the fragment in the brief and brilliant essay indeed he has done so witness his first productions that multitude of succinct texts he published both before his departure for India and after his return In  and  he contributed regularly to a Bucharest daily I was living in a provincial town where I was completing my secondary studies the paper was delivered there at eleven in the morning During recess I would rush to the kiosk to buy it and that was how I became familiar with the more or less exotic names of Asvaghosha Ksoma of Koros Buonaiutti Eugenio d Ors and so many more I much preferred the articles about foreigners because their works not to be found in my little town seemed so mysterious and definitive happiness for me was the hope of reading them someday Eventual disappointment was therefore remote whereas it was within arm s reach with the native writers How much erudition how much vigor and verve were poured out in those fugitive articles I am sure that they were throbbing with life with interest and that I am not exaggerating their value by the distortions of memory I read them as an enthusiast it is true but as a lucid enthusiast What I particularly valued was the young Eliade s gift for making every idea vivid contagious for investing each with a halo of hysteria but a hysteria that was positive stimulating healthy It is clear that this gift is entirely that of a certain time of life and that even if one still possesses it beyond that time one prefers to display it only when one takes up the history of religions    Nowhere was it more evident than in those Letters to a Provincial Reader that Eliade wrote after his return from India and that appeared in installments in the same daily I don t think I missed a single one of those letters I read them all indeed we all read them for they concerned us they were addressed to us Most often we were taken to task and each of us waited our turn One day mine came I was invited to do nothing less than liquidate my obsessions cease invading the periodicals with my grim notions deal with other problems than that of death my fixation then as always Would I yield to such a challenge I had no intention of doing so I was reluctant to admit that one could address any problem other than this one I had just published a text on the vision of death in northern art and I planned to persevere in the same direction In my heart of hearts I blamed my friend for not identifying himself with something indeed for identifying himself with nothing for trying to be everything since he was unable to be something for being in short incapable of fanaticism of delirium of depth by which I meant the faculty of giving oneself up to an obsession and standing by it I imagined that to be something was to assume an attitude totally and therefore to reject availability entertainment any perpetual renewal To create a world for oneself a limited absolute and to cling to it with all one s might that seemed to me the ultimate intellectual duty It was the notion of commitment of engagement if you will but engagement that had the inner life as its sole object a commitment to myself and not to others I reproached Eliade for being elusive because he was so open so mobile so enthusiastic I also reproached him for not being interested exclusively in India it seemed to me that India could effectively replace all the rest and that it was a fallingoff to be concerned with anything else All these grievances were embodied in an article with the aggressive title The Man without a Destiny in which I assailed the instability of this figure I so admired his inability to be a man of one idea I set forth the negative aspect of each of his virtues which is the classical way of being unjust and disloyal to someone  I blamed him for mastering his moods and his passions for being able to use them as he liked for spiriting away the tragic and for being unaware of fatality This formal attack had the defect of being too general it might have been launched against anyone Why should a theoretical mind a man absorbed by problems figure as a hero or a monster There is no affinity of substance between ideas and tragedy But at the time I thought that every idea must incarnate itself or turn into a lyric cry Convinced that discouragement was the very sign of awakening of awareness I castigated my friend for being too optimistic for being interested in too many things and for manifesting an activity incompatible with the demands of true knowledge Because I was abulic I believed myself more advanced than he as if my abulic were the result of a spiritual conquest or a willtowisdom I remember telling him once that in a previous life he must have fed entirely on greens to be able to preserve so much freshness and trust and so much innocence too I could not forgive him for the fact that I felt older than he I held him responsible for my acrimony and my fiascos and it seemed to me that he had acquired his hopes at the expense of mine How could he function in so many different sectors It was his curiosity in which I saw a demon or with Saint Augustine a disease that was my invariable grievance But in him curiosity was not a disease on the contrary it was a sign of health And I blamed him for that health and envied it at the same time But here I must be permitted a little indiscretion I should probably not have dared to write The Man without a Destiny if a special circumstance had not determined me to do so We had a mutual friend an actress of great talent who unfortunately for her was obsessed with metaphysical problems This obsession eventually compromised both her talent and her career On the stage right in the middle of a scene her essential preoccupations would overwhelm her invade her seize her mind so that what she was saying suddenly seemed of an intolerable inanity Her performances suffered she was much too obsessed to be able to change or to want to change She was not dismissed merely given minor parts that would cause her no difficulties at all She took advantage of this to devote herself to her interrogations and her speculative tastes bringing to them all the passion she had deployed in the theater Seeking answers she turned in her confusion to Eliade then less inspired to me One day unable to stand it anymore he sent her away and refused to see her again She came to tell me her disappointments and after that I saw her often listening as she talked She was dazzling it is true but so allabsorbing so wearing so insistent that after each of our meetings I would go to the nearest bistro and get drunk exasperated and fascinated A peasant girl for she was an autodidact who had grown up in a godforsaken village who talked to you about Nothingness with such brio such fervor She had learned several languages dabbled in theosophy read the great poets experienced a good number of disappointments though none had affected her so much as the last Her merits like her torments were such that at the beginning of my friendship with her it seemed to me inexplicable and inadmissible that Eliade should have treated her so cavalierly Regarding his behavior toward her as inexcusable I wrote to avenge her The Man without a Destiny When the article appeared on the first page of a monthly she was delighted by it read it aloud in my presence as if it were some glamorous tirade and then proceeded to analyze it paragraph by paragraph You ve never written anything better she told me misplaced praise she was actually bestowing on herself for was it not she who had somehow provoked the article and provided me with its elements Subsequently I understood Eliade s weariness and exasperation with her and the absurdity of my excessive attack which he never held against me which even amused him This character trait deserves note for experience has taught me that writers all afflicted with prodigious memory are incapable of forgetting an overly wounding impertinence It was during this same period that he began teaching at the Faculty of Letters in Bucharest I attended his lectures whenever I could The fervor he lavished on his articles was fortunately recognizable in his lectures the most animated the most vibrant I have ever heard Without notes without anything swept on by a vertigo of lyric erudition he was a fountain of convulsed yet coherent words underlined by the spasmodic movements of his hands An hour of tension after which miraculously he did not seem tired and perhaps indeed was not It was as if he possessed the art of indefinitely postponing fatigue Everything negative everything that incites to selfdestruction on the physical as well as the spiritual plane was then and is now alien to him whence his inaptitude for resignation for remorse for all the sentiments that imply impasse stagnation nonfuture Once again I may be speaking out of turn but I believe that if he has a perfect comprehension of sin he has no sense of it he is too febrile for that too dynamic too hurried too full of projects too intoxicated by the possible Only those have such a sense who endlessly ruminate upon their past who fasten themselves to it and are unable to tear themselves away who invent defects out of a need for moral torment and delight in the memory of any shameful or irreparable action they have committed or above all wanted to commit Obsessives to speak of them further They alone have time to descend into the abysses of remorse to sojourn there to wallow there they alone are kneaded of that substance out of which the authentic Christian is made that is someone ravaged corroded from within suffering the morbid desire to be a reprobate and ending all the same by overcoming that desire such a victory never complete being what he calls having faith Since Pascal and Kierkegaard we can no longer conceive of salvation without a procession of infirmities and without the secret pleasures of the interior drama Today especially since malediction is in vogue it is literature we are discussing we would have everyone live in anguish and anathema But can a man of learning be accursed And why should he be Does he not know too much to condescend to hell and its narrow circles It is virtually certain that only the dark aspects of Christianity still rouse a certain echo in us Perhaps Christianity if we would regain its essence must be seen in fact en noir If this image this vision is correct Eliade is from all appearances marginal to this religion But perhaps he is marginal to all religions as much by profession as by conviction is he not one of the most brilliant representatives of a new Alexandrianism that after the fashion of the old puts all beliefs on the same level without being able to adopt any Once we refuse to hierarchize them which are we to prefer which adopt and which divinity invoke One does not imagine a specialist in the history of religions at prayer Or if indeed he does pray then he belies his teaching contradicts himself ruins his Treatises in which no true god figures in which all gods are on equal footing Though he describes and discusses them with all the talent in the world he cannot inspire them with life he will have extracted all their sap he will have compared them to each other scoured them against each other to their great detriment and what will be left of them is anemic symbols with which a believer can do nothing if at this stage of erudition of disillusion and of irony there can still be someone who truly believes We are all Eliade first of all cidevant believers we are all religious spirits without religion  That Fatal Perspicacity EACH EVENT is only one more bad sign Occasionally though an exception does occur which the chronicler exaggerates to create the illusion of the unexpected That envy is universal is best proved by the fact that it breaks out among the mad themselves in their brief intervals of lucidity Every anomaly seduces us Life in the first place that anomaly par excellence Standing one readily admits that every passing moment vanishes forever prone this obvious point seems so inadmissible that we long never to get up again Progress and the Eternal Return two meaningless things What remains Resignation to becoming to surprises that are no such things to calamities that pretend to be uncommon If we began by doing away with all those who can breathe only on a platform Vehement by nature vacillating by choice Which way to tend With whom to side What self to join Our virtues and our vices must be tenacious to keep themselves on the surface to safeguard that enterprising style we need in order to resist the glamour of destruction or despair You speak of God frequently It is a word I no longer use an exnun writes me Not everyone has the good fortune to be disgusted by it In the still of certain nights for lack of a confidant we are reduced to the One who played this part for centuries for millennia Irony that nuanced rancorous impertinence is the art of being able to stop The merest probe beneath the surface destroys it If you have a tendency to insist you run the risk of capsizing with it What is marvelous is that each day brings us a new reason to disappear Since the only things we remember are humiliations and defeats what is the use of all the rest To inquire into the basis of anything makes one long to throw oneself on the ground In any case that is how I used to answer the crucial questions questions without an answer Opening this textbook on prehistory I come across some specimens of our ancestors as grim as could be Doubtless they had to be so Disgusted and ashamed I quickly close the book realizing I will open it again whenever I want to dwell on the genesis of our horrors and our filth The secret life of antilife and this chemical comedy instead of inclining us to smile gnaws at our vitals and maddens us The need to devour oneself absolves one of the need to believe If fury were an attribute of the Almighty I should long since have transcended my mortal status Existence might be justified if each of us behaved as if he were the last man alive Ignatius of Loyola tormented by scruples whose nature he does not specify tells us that he considered destroying himself Even he This temptation is certainly more widespread and more deeply rooted than is realized It is in fact the honor of mankind until it becomes the duty To create only someone mistaken about himself someone ignorant of the secret motives behind his actions creates Once the creator is transparent to himself he no longer creates Selfknowledge antagonizes the demon Here is where we must seek out the reason that Socrates wrote nothing That we can be wounded by the very people we despise discredits pride In a work admirably translated from English just one blemish les abimes du scepticism for which the translator should have supplied doute for in French the word skepticism has a nuance of dilettantism even frivolity not to be associated with the notion of the abyss A taste for formula goes along with a weakness for definitions for whatever has least relation to reality Everything that can be classified is perishable Only what is susceptible to several interpretations endures To confront the blank page what a Waterloo prospect In conversation with someone whatever his merits may be never forget for a moment that in his profound reactions he is no

every form of failure including success We haven t a single letter of Shakespeare s Didn t he write any One would have liked to hear Hamlet complain about his mail The eminent virtue of calumny is that it produces a vacuum around you without your having to raise a finger Desperate disgust in the presence of a crowd whether highspirited or sullen Everything is in decline and always has been Once this diagnosis is well established you can utter any enormity you are even obliged to If you are almost always overcome by events it is because you need merely wait in order to realize that you have been guilty of naivete The passion for music is in itself an admission We know more about a stranger who abandons himself to it than about someone indifferent to it whom we deal with every day Dead of night No one nothing but the society of the moments Each pretends to keep us company then escapes desertion after desertion To side with things testifies to an upsetting perturbation To say living is to say partial objectivity a belated phenomenon an alarming symptom is the first stage of capitulation One would have to be as unenlightened as an angel or an idiot to imagine that the human escapade could turn out well A neophyte s virtues are accentuated and reinforced under the effect of his new convictions He knows this what he does not know is that his faults increase proportionately The source of his chimeras and his vainglory My children salt comes from water and if it comes in contact with water it dissolves and vanishes In the same way the monk is born of woman and if he

Genesis Every life is the story of a collapse If biographies are so fascinating it is because the heroes and the cowards quite as much strive to innovate in the art of debacle Disappointed by everyone it is inevitable that we should eventually be so by ourselves unless that is how we began Since I first began to observe men I have learned only to love them more writes Lavater a contemporary of Chamfort Such a remark normal for an inhabitant of a Swiss village might have seemed of an indecorous simplicity to a frequenter of Parisian salons Regret at not having been deceived like all the rest rage at having seen clearly such is the secret misery of more than one enlightened person How could I resign myself even for a moment to what is not eternal Yet this happens to me at this very moment for example Each of us clings as best he can to his unlucky star The older one grows the more clearly one realizes that though one believes oneself liberated from everything in reality one is liberated from nothing On a gangrened planet we should abstain from making plans but we make them still optimism being as we know a dying man s reflex Meditation is a waking state sustained by a dim

only sensation granted a content if not a meaning Despondency This English word charged with all the nuances of collapse will have been the key to my years the emblem of my moments of my negative courage of my invalidation of all tomorrows When we have no further desire to show ourselves we take refuge in music that Providence of the abulic The reasons for persisting in Being seem less and less well founded and our successors will find it easier than we to be rid of such obstinacy Once we are grazed by certainty we no longer mistrust ourselves and others Confidence in all its forms is a source of action hence of error When we encounter someone actual our surprise is such that we wonder if we are not the victim of some vertigo What is the use of combing works of consolation since they are legion and since only two or three count If you don t want to explode with rage leave your memory alone abstain from burrowing there Whatever follows the laws of life hence whatever decays inspires me with reflections so contradictory that they border on mental confusion To live in fear of being bored to death everywhere even in God this obsession with boredom imposes limits in it I see the reason for my spiritual unfulfillment Between Epicurism and Stoicism which are we to choose I shift from one to the other and most often am faithful to both at once which is my way of espousing the maxims Antiquity preferred to the swarming of dogmas It is to our inertia that we owe our rescue from the inflation into which more than one man falls out of an excess of vanity labor or talent If it is not comforting it is in any case flattering to tell ourselves that we shall die without having given our measure To have shouted one s doubts from the rooftops even while siding with that school of discretion which is skepticism The considerable service done us by pests thieves of our time who keep us from leaving behind a complete image of our capacities It is praiseworthy for us to love anything and anyone except our kind precisely because they resemble ourselves This phenomenon suffices to explain why history is what it is Most of our evils issue from a great distance from this or that ancestor ruined by his excesses We are punished for his dissipations no need to drink he will have drunk in our place That hangover which so surprises us is the price we pay for his euphorias Thirty years of ecstasy at the altar of the Cigarette Now when I see others sacrifice to my former idol I do not understand them I regard them as unhinged or defective If a vice we have conquered becomes alien to us to such a degree how can we fail to be astounded by those we have not practiced In order to deceive melancholy you must keep moving Once you stop it wakens if in fact it has ever dozed off The desire to work comes over me only when I have an appointment I always go off feeling certain I am missing a unique opportunity to outdo myself I cannot do without the things I care nothing for the Duchess du Maine liked to say Frivolity to this degree is a prelude to renunciation If the Almighty could realize how burdensome the merest action is to me on some occasions He would not fail in an impulse of pity to yield me His place Not knowing which way to turn preferring a discontinuous reflection image of time broken into pieces    What I know wreaks havoc upon what I want Returning home after a cremation instant devaluation of Eternity and all the other great words Nameless prostration then dilation beyond the limits of the world and the resistance of the mind The thought of death enslaves those whom it haunts It liberates only at the beginning then it degenerates into an obsession thereby ceasing to be a thought The world is an accident of God accidens Dei How right the formula of Albertus Magnus seems By virtue of depression we recall those misdeeds we buried in the depths of our memory Depression exhumes our shames In our veins flows the blood of monkeys If we were to think of it often we should end by giving up No more theology no more metaphysics which comes down to saying no more divagations no more arrogance no more excess no more anything    Is it conceivable to adhere to a religion founded by someone else Tolstoy s excuse as a preacher is that he had two disciples who derived the practical consequences of his homilies Wittgenstein and Gandhi The first gave away his possessions the second had none to give away The world begins and ends with us Only our consciousness exists it is everything and this everything vanishes with it Dying we leave nothing Then why so much fuss around an event that is no such thing There comes a moment when one imitates nothing more than oneself When you waken with a start and long to get back to sleep you must dismiss every impulse of thought any shadow of an idea For it is the formulated idea the distinct idea that is sleep s worst enemy A hairraising figure the misunderstood man brings everything back to himself His sneers fail to counterbalance the praises that he never ceases to grant himself and that exceed those not offered him O for the lucky ones rare it is true who having triumphed are able on occasion to stand aside In any case they do not exhaust themselves in recriminations and their vanity consoles us for the arrogance of the misunderstood If from time to time we are tempted by faith it is because faith proposes an alternative humiliation it is after all preferable to find oneself in a position of inferiority before a god than before a hominid We can console someone only by following the direction of his affliction to the point where the afflicted man can endure being so no longer So many memories that loom up without apparent necessity of what use are they except to show us that with age we are becoming external to our own life that these remote events no longer have anything to do with us and that one day the same will be true of this life itself The mystic s all is nothing is merely a preliminary to the absorption in that all which becomes miraculously existent that is really all This conversion was not to function in me the positive luminous portion of mysticism having been denied me Between the demand to be clear and the temptation to be obscure impossible to decide which deserves more respect Having scrutinized those we must envy to realize we would willingly exchange fates with no one everyone reacts in this way Then how explain that envy is the oldest and least threadbare of infirmities Not easy to avoid resentment of a friend who has insulted you during a fit of madness Though you keep telling yourself that he was not himself you react as if for once he had revealed a wellkept secret If Time were a patrimony a possession death would be the worst form of theft Not taking revenge only half flatters us considering that we never know whether our behavior is based on nobility or on cowardice Knowledge or the crime of indiscretion No use counting on the windfall of being alone always escorted by oneself Without will no conflict no tragedy among the abulic Yet the failure of will can be experienced more painfully than a tragic destiny We come to terms one way or another with any fiasco with the exception of death fiasco itself When we have committed some vile action we hesitate to take it on ourselves to designate the party responsible we waste ourselves in endless ruminations which are only a further vileness though attenuated by the acrobatics of shame and remorse The relief of discovering on the threshold of dawn that it is futile to get to the heart of anything at all If He who is called God were not the symbol par excellence of solitude I should never have paid Him the slightest attention But ever intrigued by monsters how could I neglect their adversary more alone than any of them Every victory is more or less a lie it touches us only on the surface whereas a defeat however trivial affects us in the deepest part of ourselves where it will make sure it is not forgotten Thus whatever happens we can count on its company The amount of emptiness I have accumulated while keeping my individual status the miracle of not having exploded under the weight of so much nonexistence Without the perfume of the Incurable that it trails after it boredom would be the most insupportable of all scourges Consciousness of my indignity was crushing me No argument came to oppose to weaken it Though I invoked this or that exploit nothing availed You are merely a supernumerary a selfassured voice kept repeating Finally beside myself I answered with the right panache No need to treat me this way is it really my responsibility to be the sworn enemy of the planet indeed of the macrocosm To die is to prove one knows one s own interest The moment that separates itself from all others that liberates itself from them and betrays them with what joy do we hail its infidelity If we knew the hour of our brain Unless everything is changed which never happens no one can resolve his contradictions Death alone helps here and it is here that it scores points and outclasses life To have invented the murderous smile    For thousands of years we were merely mortal At last we are promoted to the rank of the moribund To think we could have spared ourselves from living all that we have lived On this immaculate page a gnat was making a dash for it Why be in such a hurry Where are you going what are you looking for Relax I screamed out in the middle of the night I would have been so pleased to see it collapse It s harder than you think to gain disciples To have nothing in common with the Universe and to wonder by virtue of what disorder one belongs to it Why fragments one young philosopher reproached me Out of laziness out of frivolity out of disgust but also for other reasons    And since I was finding none of these I launched into prolix explanations that sounded serious to him and that ended by convincing him French the ideal idiom for translating equivocal sentiments with some delicacy In a borrowed language you are conscious of words they exist not in you but outside of you This interval between yourself and your means of expression explains why it is difficulty even impossible to be a poet in another language besides your own How extract a substance from words that are not rooted in you The newcomer lives on the surface of language he cannot in a tongue belatedly learned translate that subterranean agony from which poetry issues Devoured by a nostalgia for paradise without having known a single attack of true faith    Bach in his grave So I shall have seen him like so many others by one of those indiscretions so familiar to gravediggers and journalists since then I keep thinking of those skulls that have nothing original about them except that they proclaim the nothingness he denied So long as there is a single god standing man s task is not done The kingdom of the Insoluble extends as far as the eye can see Our satisfaction therein is mitigated however What better proof that we are contaminated by hope from the start After all I have not wasted my time I too have fidgeted like anyone else in this aberrant universe  Caillois Fascination of the Mineral CAILLOIS S EARLY STUDIES were entirely comme il faut to the point of acknowledging his reactions as a disciple witness the pains he takes in the  foreword to Man and the Sacred to reassure his masters asking them to ignore the last pages of the book where exceeding the limits of positive knowledge he permits himself several metaphysical developments Since at this time he appeared to believe in the history of religions in sociology and ethnology he might normally have confined himself to one of these fields and ended his career as a scientist and a scholar That he took another path was due largely to external circumstances but as always they do not account for what is essential It is important to know why at the outset he already inclined toward the fragment rather than toward the system and why too he exhibited that horror of massive constructions that concern for elegance that felicity of expression that touch of breathlessness in demonstration that proportion finally of reasoning and rhythm of theory and seduction These superior infirmities these flaws he might have camouflaged provided he sacrificed himself abdicated his singularity like more than one possessor of positive knowledge  Not being disposed to do so he was to deviate from his first preoccupations betray or disappoint his masters follow a personal path choose diversity turn away in short from science accessible only to those who know and endure the intoxication of monotony He would traverse a number of subjects and disciplines poetry Marxism psychoanalysis dreams games never as a dilettante but as an impatient and greedy spirit condemned by irony to inadhesion and frequently to injustice One can readily imagine him raging against a theme he has seized upon a problem he has elucidated which he will abandon to the scrupulous or the obsessive as spending any more time on it would strike him as indecent This exasperation based on lassitude exigence or tact is the key to his permanent renewal to his intellectual peregrinations One cannot help thinking here of a converse procedure such as that of a Maurice Blanchot who in the analysis of literary phenomena has brought to the point of heroism or asphyxia the superstition of depth in a rumination that combines the advantages of the vague and the abyss I have often wondered whether in the case of Caillois the refusal of reassessment what he calls his fundamental dispersion would not make difficult and even impossible any attempt to identify his true self He is the contrary of an obsessive yet only obsessives yield their true self for they alone perhaps are sufficiently limited to have such a thing Without attributing to him obsessions that he would reject I have nonetheless been led to seek where he is supremely himself and which of his books had he written only that one would reveal him best and testify that he has pursued and overtaken his own essence It has seemed to me that Caillois subject to so many enthusiasms has encountered only one passion and that in the work where he describes it he has divulged the best part of his secret When one undertakes a quest in any realm the sign of finding is a change of tone those outbursts of lyricism that are not a priori indispensable Stones begins with a prefacehymn and continues for page after page on a note of enthusiasm tempered by meticulousness I leave aside the secondary reasons for this fervor in order to indicate only the principal one which seems to me to reside in the search and the nostalgia for the primordial in the obsession with beginnings with the worlds before man with a mystery slower vaster and graver than the fate of that transitory species To hark back not only beyond the human but beyond life itself to attain to the principle of the ages to make oneself a contemporary of the immemorial such is the enterprise of this exalted mineralogist who rejoices when he detects in a nodule of agate that is abnormally light the sound of a liquid water hidden there since the dawn of the planet anterior water water of origins incorruptible fluid that gives the sensation to the living man contemplating it that he is but a dumbfounded intruder in the universe The quest for beginnings is the most important of all those we can undertake Each of us makes it if only in brief moments as if performing this return presented the unique means of recovering and transcending ourselves of triumphing over ourselves and over everything It is also the only mode of escape that is not a desertion or a deception But we have got in the habit of attaching ourselves to the future of putting apocalypse above cosmogony of idolizing the explosion and the end of banking to an absurd degree on the Revolution or the Last Judgment Would it not be wiser to turn back toward a chaos much richer than the one we anticipate It is toward the moment when this initial chaos gradually subsiding experimented with form that Caillois chooses to turn toward that phase where stones after the glowing moment of their genesis became algebra vertigo order But whether he invokes them burning melting or incurably cold he exhibits in his description of them an ardor that is not habitual in him I am thinking particularly of his almost visionary way of presenting a specimen of native copper taken from Lake Michigan whose brittle meshes at once fragile and hard offer the imagination the paradox of a hyperbolic sclerosis They inexplicably transcend the Inert they add the rigor of death to what never was alive They inscribe upon the metal s surface the folds of a superfluous ostentatious pleonastic shroud Reading Stones I found myself wondering more than once if this was not a language sealed inside its own significations with no reality other than its particular glamour Under these conditions why not go see for myself After all I have never looked at a stone and as for the ones called precious that epithet alone suffices to make me detest them So I paid a visit to the Hall of Mineralogy and to my great surprise discovered that the book had merely told the truth that it was the work not of a virtuoso but of a guide determined to grasp from within certain solidified marvels in order to reconstitute by a scarcely conceivable regression their state of original indeterminacy I had just initiated myself into the mineral during a crucial hour that brought home to me the inanity of being a sculptor or a painter Having haunted a few years earlier the paleontology section of the museum I felt then that the skeletons on display were so clean as to disgust one with the scandalous precariousness of flesh that they could by contrast suggest a certain serenity Yet compared to stones skeletons are pitiful But do stones themselves actually afford as Caillois observes several serenities and will they wield their spellbinding power over him to the end Will they resist his need for change his craving for the new the disease of dispersion  In thinking back to the moment of their genesis he approached an illumination an unexpected kind of mystical state an abyss in which to dissolve This illumination was to be shortlived once the abyss has been escaped we are informed very clearly that it contains nothing divine that is not matter lava fusion cosmic tumult I cannot insist sufficiently on the originality of this failure We are all of course failures in some mystic aspiration we have all recorded our limits and our impossibilities at the heart of some extreme experience But if we have tried to explode our temporal shackles it is because we have frequented the Desert Fathers Meister Eckhart or the later Buddhists whereas it was by brooding over dendrites and pyrites or by following in reverse the career of a certain quartz of a certain agate that Caillois felt himself slide out of time and made contact beyond the great technical ordeals with the motionless matter of the longest quietude where he could not continue because his mind tempted and disappointed by trance found it impossible to accede to deliverance by Nothing not even the mineral He would say it himself in his book and better still in the conclusion of the Recit du Deloge a revealing text recently published in Commerce I have attained the ultimate reality which is not nothingness but the blur that I have become Hence not nothingness and we realize why nothingness is ultimately merely a purer version of God which is why the mystics have plunged into it with such frenzy as have moreover the unbelievers with a certain religious capital Caillois does not envy the former and would probably shrink from being classed with the latter He acknowledges himself unsuited for the illuminating annihilation he admits his defeat his lassitudes and his resignations he proclaims and savors his collapse After the enfeeblement of a fascination after the orgy and ecstasy of origins the superbia of disarray the journey into    blur  Michaux The Passion of the Exhaustive FIFTEEN YEARS AGO Michaux would take me regularly to the Grand Palais where all sorts of scientific films were shown some curious others technical impenetrable To tell the truth I was intrigued less by the projections than by the interest my friend took in them I could not understand the motive behind so obstinate an attention How I kept wondering did a mind so vehement so oriented toward itself in perpetual fervor or frenzy manage to be attracted by demonstrations so meticulous so scandalously impersonal It was only later brooding over his explorations of drugs that I understood what excesses of objectivity and rigor Michaux could achieve His scruples were to lead him to a fetishism of the infinitesimal of the imperceptible nuance as much psychological as verbal endlessly recapitulated with a breathless insistence To reach vertigo by investigation that seemed to me the secret of his enterprise Read in L Infini turbulent the page where he describes himself as pierced by white where everything is white where hesitation itself is white and horripilation no less After that there is no more white he has exhausted white he has killed white His obsession with the bottom of things makes him brutal he liquidates appearance after appearance not sparing one he exterminates them by engulfing himself in them by pursuing them precisely to their bottom that bottom which is nonexistent radically insignificant    One English critic has found these soundings terrifying For me on the contrary they are positive and exalting in their impatience to disintegrate and to pulverize by which I mean to discover and to know truth in anything being merely the consummation of a sapping operation Though he classified himself among those who are born tired what has he ever done but flee delusion excavate search Nothing it is true is so tiring as the effort toward lucidity toward the vision without mercy Apropos of a famous contemporary fascinated by that universal gangrene History he one day used a revealing expression spiritual blindness Michaux himself on the contrary is someone who has abused the imperative to see within and around himself to get to the bottom not only of an idea which is easier than one thinks but of the merest experience or impression has he not subjected each of his sensations to a scrutiny that includes everything torture jubilation willtoconquest This passion to apprehend himself this exhaustive comingtoconsciousness leads to an ultimatum he ceaselessly addresses a devastating incursion into the darkest zones of his being It is from such a given that we must envision his revolt against his dreams and the need he feels despite the hegemony of psychoanalysis to minimize them to denounce them to lay them open to ridicule Disappointed by them he delights in punishing them and in proclaiming their emptiness But the real reason for his fury is perhaps less their nullity than their total independence of him the privilege they enjoy of escaping his censorship of hiding of mocking and humiliating him by their mediocrity Mediocre yes but autonomous sovereign It is in the name of consciousness of becoming conscious as an exigence and a duty and also out of wounded pride that Michaux inculpates and calumnies them that he lodges an indictment against them a veritable challenge to the enthusiasms of the period By discrediting the performances of the unconscious he rids himself of the most precious illusion in circulation for over half a century All interior violence is contagious his more than any other One never leaves his presence demoralized And it is of little consequence after all whether one frequents him assiduously or only on occasion from the moment when in all essential circumstances one tries to imagine his reaction or his remarks solitary omnipresent he is always there     forever inseparable from what counts in an existence This longdistance intimacy is possible only with an obsessive who is capable of impartiality an introvert who is open to everything and disposed to speak of everything even of current affairs  His views on the international situation his diagnoses of political matters are remarkably just and often prophetic To have so exact a perception of the external world and at the same time manage to apprehend delirium from within to traverse its many forms to appropriate them so to speak one can accept this anomaly so captivating so enviable as just that without seeking to understand it Yet I am going to suggest a necessarily approximate explanation Nothing is more agreeable at least for me than a conversation with Michaux about sickness It is as if he had anticipated and feared all diseases expected and fled them    Any one of his books is a procession of symptoms of threats glimpsed and in part made actual infirmities pondered again and again His sensibility to the diverse modalities of disequilibrium is prodigious But politics that subPromethean temptation what is politics but a permanent and exasperated disequilibrium the curse par excellence of a megalomaniac monkey The least neutral mind the least passive I know could not help but be interested in politics if only to wield his sagacity or his disgust Writers in general when they comment upon current events display a laughable naivete It is important it seems to me to cite an exception I believe I caught Michaux only once in flagrante delieto not of naivete he is psychologically unfit for it but of good feelings of confidence of abandon of something I translated at the time into terms it may be useful to give here I admired him for his aggressive clearsightedness for his denials and his phobias for the sum of his aversions Last night in the little street where we had been talking for hours he told me with quite an unexpected touch of emotion that the idea of man s ultimate disappearance moved him    Whereupon I left him convinced I should never forgive him for that commiseration and that weakness If I extract this unspeakably naive note from an undated diary it is to show that at the time what I especially prized in him was his incisive tense inhuman aspect his explosions and his sneers his flaying humor his vocation as a convulsionary and a gentleman Indeed it seemed secondary that he was a poet One day he confessed I remember that he sometimes wondered whether he was one That he is a poet is obvious but it is conceivable that he might not have been one What he is much more obviously I understood when I realized that as a young man contemplating entering the priesthood he devoured the mystics I assert as fact that had he not been one himself he would never have launched himself so methodically so desperately in pursuit of extreme states Extreme this side of the absolute His works on drugs proceeded from the dialogue with the mystic he originally was a repressed and sabotaged mystic waiting to take his revenge If we were to collect all the passages in which Michaux deals with ecstasy and if we were to suppress all references in them to mescaline or any other hallucinogen would we not have the impression of reading explicitly religious experiences inspired and not provoked and deserving to figure in a breviary of unique moments and dazzling heresies The mystics aspire not to subside into God but to exceed Him swept on as they are by something remote by a delirium of the ultimate which we encounter among all those who have been visited and submerged by trance states Michaux joins the mystics through his inner gusts his longing to attack the inconceivable to force it to break it open to go beyond without ever stopping without retreating before any danger Having neither the luck nor the misfortune to weigh anchor in the absolute he creates his own abysses provoking ever new ones plunges into them and describes them These abysses it may be objected are only states No doubt But for us everything is a state and nothing but a state consigned as we are to psychology ever since we were forbidden to wander in the Supreme    A true mystic yet an unrealized one We understand Michaux insofar as he has undertaken everything in order not to conclude keeping his irony at the very extremities to which his researches have led him When he has reached some limitexperience an impure absolute where he vacillates where he no longer knows where he has come out he never fails to resort to a familiar or comical turn of phrase in order to make it clear that he is still himself that he remembers that he is experimenting that he will never completely identify himself with any of the moments of his quest In all of these simultaneous excesses cohabit the ecstatic outbursts of an Angela di Foligno and the sarcasms of a Swift It is admirable that a man so constituted to destroy himself should have lived for many years in full possession of his vitality I take out the old man     his damn body that breaks down to which he clings so our one body for the two of us he writes in  in Vents et Poussieres Always that interval between sensation and consciousness always that superiority over what he is and over what he knows    Thus he has managed in his metaphysical perturbations in his perturbations tout court to remain by the obsession of knowledge external to himself Whereas our contradictions and incompatibilities eventually subjugate and paralyze us Michaux has succeeded in making himself the master of his without slipping toward sagesse without being swallowed up by it All his life he has been tempted by India merely tempted fortunately for if by some fatal metamorphosis he had ended by yielding to such enchantments beclouded he would have abdicated his prerogative of possessing more than one flaw that leads to wisdom and yet at the same time being fundamentally refractory to it What a catastrophe had he taken to Vedanta or to Buddhism He would have left his gifts there his faculty for excess Deliverance would have annihilated him as a writer no more gusts no more torments no more exploits It is because he has not lowered himself to any formula of salvation to any simulacrum of illumination that frequenting him is so stimulating He offers one nothing he iswhat he is he has no recipe for serenity he continues he feels his way as if he were beginning And he accepts one on condition that one offers him nothing either Once again a nonsage a nonsage on his own It astonishes me that he has not succumbed to so much intensity It is true that his intensity is not of that accidental fluctuating kind which is manifested in fits and starts constant lawless it resides in itself and relies upon itself it is inexhaustible precariousness intensity of being an expression I borrow from the language of the theologians the only one suitable to designate a success   Benjamin Fondane  Rue Rollin THE MOST CREASED and furrowed face one could imagine a face with millennial wrinkles never still animated as they were by the most contagious and the most explosive torment I could not contemplate that countenance enough Never before had I seen such harmony between appearance and utterance between physiognomy and speech Impossible for me to think of Fondane s slightest remark without immediately perceiving the imperious presence of his features I used to see him often I knew him during the Occupation  always planning to stay no more than an hour and I would end up spending the afternoon it was my fault of course but his as well he loved to talk and I lacked the courage and still more the desire to interrupt a monologue that left me exhausted and enthralled Yet it was I who was the garrulous one during my first visit which I had paid with the intention of asking him some questions about Shestov Probably out of a need to show off I asked none at all preferring to set forth the reasons for my own interest in the Russian philosopher of whom Fondane was the disciple though less faithful than inspired It may be apposite to note here that between the two wars Shestov was very well known in Rumania and that his books were read more fervently there than elsewhere Fondane had no idea of this and was greatly surprised to learn that in the country of his birth we had followed the same trajectory as he    Wasn t there something disturbing about this and much more than a coincidence Many readers of Fondane s Baudelaire have been struck by the chapter on boredom I myself have always linked his predilection for this theme to his Moldavian origins A paradise of neurasthenia Moldavia is a province of an unendurable dreary charm in  I spent two weeks in Jassy the capital where if it had not been for alcohol I would have foundered in the most dissolving of depressions Fondane loved to quote lines by Bacovia the laureate of Moldavian ennui a boredom less refined but much more corrosive than Baudelaire s spleen It is an enigma to me that so many people manage not to die of it The experience of the abyss has as we see remote sources Like Shestov Fondane liked to start with a quotation a simple pretext to which he kept referring and from which he drew unexpected conclusions In his developments there was always despite their subtlety something alluring subtle he certainly was he even abused his subtlety it was his patent vice In general he couldn t stop he had the genius of variation and it seemed when one listened to him that he had a horror of the period This was glaringly apparent in his improvisations as it was in his books especially Baudelaire On several occasions he told me he ought to cut a good many pages and it is incomprehensible that he did not do so when we realize that he was living in the quasicertainty of an imminent disaster He believed himself to be threatened and indeed he was but it may be that inwardly he was resigned to the victim s lot for without that mysterious complicity with the Ineluctable and without a certain fascination with tragedy there is no explanation for his rejection of all precautions the most elementary of which was that of changing residences He was betrayed by his concierge A strange unconcern on the part of someone who was anything but naive and whose psychological and political judgments testified to an exceptional perspicacity I still have a very exact memory of one of my first visits during which after enumerating Hitler s dizzying faults and flaws he launched into a visionary description of Germany s collapse and this in such detail that I was convinced then and there that I was witnessing a delirium It was only an anticipation of the facts In literary matters I did not always share his tastes He insistently recommended Hugo s book on Shakespeare a virtually unreadable work that reminds me of a phrase recently used by an American critic to describe the style of Tristes Tropiques the aristocracy of bombast The expression is a striking one though unfair in that instance I understood better his partiality for Nietzsche in whom he loved the foreshortenings that were so much denser than those of Novalis about whom he had reservations In truth he was always less interested in what an author said than in what he might have said in what he concealed in this he adopted Shestov s method that is the peregrination through souls much more than through doctrines Uniquely sensitive to extreme cases to the beguiling twists and turns in certain sensibilities he once told me about a White Russian who had suffered in silence for eighteen years because he thought his wife was cheating on him After so many years of mute torment one day unable to bear it any longer he had it out with her whereupon after acquiring the certitude that all his suspicions had been false incapable of enduring the notion that he had tortured himself for nothing over such a long period he went into the next room and blew his brains out On another occasion when he was describing his years in Bucharest Fondane gave me an abject article attacking him written by Tudor Arghezi a great poet but a still greater pamphleteer in prison at the time for political reasons this was just after the First World War  Fondane then a very young man had managed to visit him there for some sort of interview In return the poet had proceeded to write a caricatural portrait so unspeakable that I have never been able to understand how Fondane could have shown it to me He had his moments of detachment    Usually indulgent he ceased to be so toward those who supposed they had found    those in short who converted to anything at all He greatly esteemed Boris de Schloezer and was terrible disappointed to learn that the magisterial translator of Shestov could have shifted to Catholicism He couldn t get over it and identified the occasion with a betrayal To search was for him more than a necessity or an obsession to search without stopping was a fatality his fatality perceptible even in his way of speaking especially when he was enthusiastic or would vacillate continually between irony and breathlessness I will forever blame myself for not having written down his remarks his trouvailles the leaps of a mind turning in all directions constantly in combat with tyranny and the nullity of facts greedy for contradictions and somehow in dread of succeeding I see him now rolling cigarette after cigarette Nothing he used to say over and over again equaled the pleasure of lighting up on an empty stomach He kept on doing so despite a gastric ulcer that he proposed to deal with later in a future about which he nursed no illusions    The wife of his oldest friend told me at the time that she could not love him because of what she called his sickly look On his face he did not it is true bear the signs of prosperity but everything in him was beyond sickness and health as if both were merely stages he had transcended Whereby he resembled an ascetic an ascetic of a prodigious vivacity and verve that made one forget while he was talking his fragility his vulnerability But when he stopped talking he who in spite of everything had mastered his fate he gave the impression of dragging around something pitiful and at certain moments lost The British poet David Gascoyne who was also to suffer under other circumstances a tragic fate told me that he had been haunted for months by the image of Fondane after he encountered him by chance on the Boulevard SaintMichel on the day of Shestov s death It will readily be understood why even after thirtythree years a being so fascinating is singularly present in my mind and why too I never pass by Number  Rue Rollin without a pang   Borges Letter to Fernando Savater Paris December   Dear Friend In November during your visit to Paris you asked me to collaborate on a volume of tributes to Borges My first reaction was negative my second    as well What is the use of celebrating him when the universities themselves are doing so The misfortune of being recognized has befallen him He deserved better He deserved to remain in obscurity in the Imperceptible to remain as ineffable and unpopular as nuance itself There he was at home Consecration is the worst of punishments for a writer in general and particularly for a writer of his kind Once everyone starts quoting him you must leave off if you do not you feel you are merely swelling the ranks of his admirers of his enemies Those who want to do him justice at all costs are merely hastening his downfall I shall stop here for if I continue in this style I shall end by pitying his fate And there is every reason to suppose he can do that on his own I think I have already told you that if I was so interested in him it was because he represented a vanishing specimen of humanity he embodies the paradox of a sedentary man without an intellectual patrie a stayathome adventurer at ease in several civilizations and literatures a splendid and doomed monster In Europe as a kindred example we may cite that friend of Rilke s Rudolf Kassner who early in this century published a work of the very first order about English poetry it was after reading that book during the last war that I began to learn English    and who spoke with admirable acuity of Sterne of Gogol of Kierkegaard as well as of the Maghreb or of India Normally depth and erudition do not go together but he somehow reconciled them a universal mind lacking only grace only seduction It is here that Borges s superiority appears incomparably seductive he has managed to put a touch of the impalpable the aerial a wisp of lace on everything even on the most arduous reasoning For in Borges everything is transfigured by the spirit of play by a dance of dazzling trouvailles and delicious sophistries I have never been attracted by minds confined to a single form of culture Not to take root not to belong to any community such has been and such is my motto Oriented toward other horizons I have always wanted to know what was happening elsewhere by the time I was twenty the Balkan skyline had nothing more to offer me This is the drama and also the advantage of being born in a minor cultural space The foreign had become my god whence that thirst to travel through literatures and philosophies to devour them with a morbid ardor What is happening in Eastern Europe must inevitably happen in the countries of Latin America and I have noticed that its representatives are infinitely better informed more cultivated than the incurably provincial Westerners Neither in France nor in England do I see anyone who has a curiosity comparable to Borges s a curiosity hypertrophied to the point of mania to vice I say vice for in matters of art and reflection whatever does not turn into a somewhat perverse fervor is superficial hence unreal As a student I was led to investigate the disciples of Schopenhauer Among them was a certain Philipp Mainlander who particularly attracted me Author of a Philosophy of Deliverance he enjoyed the additional distinction in my eyes of having committed suicide This completely forgotten philosopher I flattered myself belonged to me alone not that there was any particular merit in my preoccupation my studies had inevitably brought me to him But imagine my astonishment when much later I came across a text by Borges that plucked him precisely out of oblivion If I cite this example it is because from that moment I began thinking more seriously than before about the condition of Borges fated reduced to universality constrained to exercise his mind in all directions if only to escape the Argentine asphyxia It is the South American void that makes the writers of an entire continent more open more alive and more diverse than those of Western Europe paralyzed by their traditions and incapable of shaking off their prestigious sclerosis Since you ask what I like most about Borges I have no hesitation in answering that it is his freedom in the most varied realms his faculty of speaking with an equal subtlety of the Eternal Return and the Tango For him everything is equally worthwhile from the moment he is the center of everything Universal curiosity is a sign of vitality only if it bears the absolute mark of a self a self from which everything emanates and where everything ends up sovereignty of the arbitrary beginning and end that can be interpreted according to the most capricious criteria Where is reality in all this The Self that supreme farce    Borges s playfulness reminds me of a certain romantic irony the metaphysical exploration of illusion juggling with the Infinite Friedrich Schlegel today has his back to Patagonia    Once again one can only deplore that an Encyclopedie smile and a vision so refined should provoke general approbation with all that implies    But after all Borges might become the symbol of a humanity without dogmas or systems and if there is a utopia to which I should gladly subscribe it would be the one where we all model ourselves on him on one of the least ponderous minds that ever was the last to give its true meaning to the word select  Maria Zambrano A Decisive Presence AS SOON as a woman takes up philosophy she becomes vain and aggressive with all the reactions of a parvenu Arrogant yet uncertain visibly dumbfounded she is not evidently in her element How does it happen that the uneasiness inspired by such a case is never felt in the presence of Maria Zambrano I have often asked myself the question and I believe I can answer it Maria Zambrano has not sold her soul to the Idea she has safeguarded her unique essence by setting the experience of the Insoluble above reflection upon it in short she has transcended philosophy    In her eyes only what precedes or follows the formulated is true only the word wrested from the shackles of expression or as she herself says magnificently La palabra liberada del lenguaje She is one of those beings whom one regrets meeting only too rarely but of whom one cannot stop thinking and whom one longs to understand or at least to surmise An inner fire that eludes an ardor that conceals itself beneath an ironic resignation everything in Maria Zambrano leads to something else everything involves an elsewhere everything Though one can discuss anything at all with her one is nonetheless sure to slide sooner or later toward crucial interrogations without necessarily following the meanders of reasoning Hence a style of conversation unblemished by objectivity a dialogue in which she leads one toward oneself toward one s illdefined pursuits one s virtual perplexities I remember precisely the moment when at the Cafe de Flore I made the decision to explore Utopia On this subject which we had mentioned in passing she quoted a remark of Ortega s that she quite casually developed I determined then and there to commit myself to the regret or the longing for the golden age which I did not fail to do subsequently with a frenetic curiosity that little by little was to wear itself out or rather turn into exasperation Nonetheless readings extending over two or three years had their origin in that conversation Who so much as she has the gift in anticipating one s anxiety one s search of dropping the unforeseeable and decisive word the pregnant answer And that is the reason one would like to consult her at life s turning points on the threshold of a conversion of a breakup of a betrayal at the moment of ultimate confidences the heavy and compromising kind so that she might offer one somehow a speculative absolution and reconcile one as much to one s impurities as to one s impasses one s stupors  Weininger Letter to Jacques Le Rider Paris December   Reading your book about my old and distant idol I could not help remembering what an event Geschlecht und Charakter had been for me This was in  I was seventeen and hungering for every form of excess and heresy I delighted in deriving the ultimate consequences from an idea extending rigor to aberration to provocation conferring upon frenzy the dignity of a system In other words I was passionate about everything with the exception of nuance In Weininger it was the dizzying exaggeration that fascinated me the infinity of negation the denial of common sense the murderous intransigence the search for an absolute position the craving to carry a piece of reasoning to the point where it destroyed itself and ruined the structure to which it belonged Add to this the obsession with the criminal and the epileptic particularly in uber die letzten Dinge  the cult of the inspired formula and the arbitrary excommunication the identification of woman with Nothing and even with something less    To this devastating affirmation my adherence was complete from the start The object of my letter is to acquaint you with the circumstance that incited me to espouse these extreme theses on the aforesaid Nothing A banal circumstance if ever there was one yet it dictated my conduct for several years I was still in the Lycee mad about philosophy and about a girl in the Lycee as well One important detail I did not know her personally though she belonged to the same milieu as I the bourgeoisie of Sibiu in Transylvania  As often happens with adolescents I was both insolent and timid but my timidity prevailed over my insolence For over a year this torment lasted culminating one day when I happened to be reading some book or other leaning against a tree in the town park Suddenly I heard giggling Turning around I saw who Her accompanied by one of the boys in my class the one scorned by us all and nicknamed The Louse After more than fifty years I remember perfectly how I felt at that moment I forgo the details The fact remains that I vowed on the spot to abjure sentiments And that was how I became a frequenter of brothels A year after this radical and commonplace disappointment I discovered Weininger And found myself in the ideal situation to understand him His splendid enormities concerning women intoxicated me How could I have been beguiled by a subbeing I kept asking myself Why this torment this calvary on account of a fiction a zero incarnate A fated figure had come at last to deliver me But that deliverance was to cast me into a superstition that he himself condemned for I was drifting toward that Romantik der Prostitution incomprehensible to serious minds and a specialty of eastern and southeastern Europe In any case my student life was passed under the spell of the Whore in the shadow of her protective cordial even maternal abasement Weininger by supplying me with the philosophical reasons for detesting an honest woman cured me of love during the proudest and most frenetic period I have experienced in my life I did not foresee a time when his indictments and his verdicts would no longer count for me except insofar as they would occasionally make me regret the madman I had been  Fitzgerald The Pascalian Experience of an American Novelist FOR SOME lucidity is a primordial gift a privilege even a sort of grace They have no need to acquire it to strain toward it they are predestined to it All their experiences concur to make them transparent to themselves Stricken with clearsightedness they do not even suffer from it so closely does it define them If they live in a perpetual crisis they accept that crisis quite naturally it is imminent to their existence For others lucidity is a belated result the fruit of an accident of an internal rupture occurring at a specific moment Hitherto enclosed within an agreeable opacity they adhered to the obvious aspects of things without weighing or even divining their vacuity Suddenly they are disabused and somehow engaged in spite of themselves in the career of knowledge suddenly they are stumbling among unbreathable truths for which nothing has prepared them Hence they resent their new condition regarding it not at all as a favor but as a blow Nothing prepared Scott Fitzgerald to face or to endure such unbreathable truths the effort he made to adapt himself to them however has a pathos all its own Of course all life is a process of breaking down but the blows that do the dramatic side of the work the big sudden blows that come or seem to come from outside the ones you remember and blame things on and in moments of weakness tell your friends about don t show their effect all at once There is another sort of blow that comes from within that you don t feel until it s too late to do anything about it until you realize with finality that in some regard you will never be as good a man again These are not considerations by a brilliant fashionable novelist    This Side of Paradise The Great Gatsby Tender Is the Night The Last Tycoon if Fitzgerald had limited himself to those novels he would present no more than a literary interest Fortunately he is also the author of that text The CrackUp from which I have just quoted the opening and in which he describes his failure his only great success As a young man he was dominated by a single obsession to become a successful literary man He did so He experienced notoriety and even a genuine sort of glory An incomprehensible thing for me T S Eliot wrote to Fitzgerald that he had read The Great Gatsby three times Money obsessed him he wanted to make money and he talked about it shamelessly In his letters as in his notebooks he keeps coming back to it to such a degree that we sometimes wonder whether we are in the presence of a writer or a businessman Not that I dislike correspondence in which material problems are discussed I prefer it a thousand times to the falsely spiritualized kind that slides over them or swathes them in poetry But there is the manner and the tone How many of Rilke s letters I once loved so much now seem insipid and bloodless They never allude to the shabby side of penury Intended for posterity their nobility sickens me The angels always live next door to the poor Doesn t it seem that there s a certain offhandedness or a calculated naivete in writing such things at such length in letters addressed to duchesses To play the pure spirit borders on indecency I don t believe in Rilke s angels I believe even less in his poor Too distinguished they lack cynicism that salt of poverty On the other hand the letters of a Baudelaire or a Dostoyevsky begging letters touch me by their suppliant desperate gasping tone You feel that they talk about money because they can t make any that they were born poor and will remain poor whatever happens Poverty is consubstantial with them They hardly aspire to success since they know they can never achieve it Now what embarrasses me in Fitzgerald in the early Fitzgerald is that he aspires to success and achieves it But fortunately his success will be only a detour an eclipse of his consciousness before awakening to himself to the revelation that he will never be as good a man again Fitzgerald died in  at the age of fortyfour his crisis occurred around   the period when he wrote the articles that constitute The CrackUp Before this date the crucial event in his life remained his marriage to Zelda Together they led the artificial existence of Americans on the Cote d Azur Later he would describe his stay in Europe as seven years of waste and tragedy seven years when they indulged every extravagance as though haunted by a secret desire to exhaust themselves to empty themselves out The inevitable happened Zelda collapsed into schizophrenia and survived her husband only to die in an asylum fire He had said of her Zelda is a case and not a person No doubt he meant that she was of interest only to psychiatry He on the other hand would be a person a case answerable to psychology or to history My own happiness in the past often approached such an ecstasy that I could not share it even with the person dearest to me but had to walk it away in quiet streets and lanes with only fragments of it to distil into little lines in books and I think that my happiness or talent for selfdelusion or what you will was an exception It was not the natural thing but the unnatural unnatural as the Boom and my recent experience parallels the wave of despair that swept the nation when the Boom was over I leave aside Fitzgerald s complacency in regarding himself as the expression of a lost generation or in interpreting his own crisis from external givens For that crisis if it emanated solely from a contingency would lose all its scope Insofar as they are specifically American the revelations of The CrackUp concern only literary history or history itself As inner experiences however they partake of an essence of an intensity that transcends contingencies and continents What has just happened to me    what had happened to Fitzgerald He had lived in the intoxication of success wanted happiness at all costs aspired to become a writer of the first importance Literally and figuratively he had lived asleep But then sleep left him He began to wake and what he discovered in his waking filled him with horror A clearsighted sterility submerged and paralyzed him Insomnia sheds a light on us which we do not desire but to which unconsciously we tend We demand it in spite of ourselves against ourselves From it and at the expense of our health we seek something else dangerous harmful truths everything that sleep has kept us from glimpsing Yet our insomnia liberates us from our facility and our fictions only to confront us with a blocked horizon it illuminates our impasses It dooms us while it delivers us an ambiguity inseparable from the experience of the night This experience Fitzgerald tried in vain to escape It assailed him crushed him it was too profound for his spirit Would he turn to God He detested lying which is to say that he had no access to religion The nocturnal universe rose before him like an absolute Nor had he any access to metaphysics though he would be forced toward it Obviously he was not ripe for his nights The horror has come now like a storm what if this night prefigured the night after death what if all thereafter was an eternal quivering on the edge of an abyss with everything base and vicious in oneself urging one forward and the baseness and viciousness of the world just ahead No choice no road no hope only the endless repetition of the sordid and the semitragic Or to stand forever perhaps on the threshold of life unable to pass it and return to it I am a ghost now as the clock strikes four In truths aside from the mystic and the man who is prey to a grand passion who is really ripe for his nights We may desire to lose sleep if we are believers but if we are without any certainty how to remain for hours and hours in a teteatete with ourselves We can reproach Fitzgerald for not divining the importance of the night as an occasion for or a method of knowledge as an enriching disaster but we cannot remain insensitive to the pathos of his vigils when the repetition of the sordid and the semitragic was for him the consequence of his denial of God of his incapacity to be an accomplice in the greatest metaphysical fraud in the supreme lie of our nights Now the standard cure for one who is sunk is to consider those in actual destitution or physical suffering this is an allweather beatitude for gloom in general and fairly salutory daytime advice for everyone But at three o clock in the morning a forgotten package has the same tragic importance as a death sentence and the cure doesn t work and in a real dark night of the soul it is always three o clock in the mornings day after day The daytime truths have no validity in the real dark night of the soul And instead of blessing it as a source of revelations Fitzgerald curses that night identifies it with his collapse and denies it all value as knowledge He has a Pascalian experience without the Pascalian spirit Like all frivolous men he trembles at venturing further into himself Yet a fatality impels him onward He resists extending his being to its limits and he reaches them in spite of himself The extremity to which he accedes far from being the result of a plenitude is the expression of a broken spirit it is the boundlessness of the Flaw it is the negative experience of the infinite His sickness plunges down to the very sources of affectivity This he will explain himself in a text that gives us the key to his troubles I only wanted absolute quiet to think out why I had developed a sad attitude toward sadness a melancholy attitude toward melancholy and a tragic attitude toward tragedy why I had become identified with the objects of my horror or compassion A crucial text a sick man s text In order to understand its importance let us try to define by contrast the behavior of the healthy man the active man Let us grant ourselves to this effect a supplement of health    However contradictory and intense our states normally we master them we manage to neutralize them health is the faculty we possess of keeping a certain distance from them A wellbalanced being always manages to slide over his depths or to thread his way across his own abysses Health the condition of action presupposes a flight from oneself a desertion of ourselves No true action without the fascination of the object When we act our inner states count only by their relation to the external world they have no intrinsic value hence it is permissible for us to master them If we should happen to be sad we are so on account of a specific situation an incident or a distinct reality The sick man proceeds entirely otherwise He realizes his states in themselves his sadness sadly his melancholy melancholically and he espouses he experiences all tragedy tragically He is merely subject and nothing but If he identifies himself with the objects of his horror or of his compassion these objects constitute for him only various modalities of himself To be sick is to coincide totally with oneself Every act of life from the morning toothbrush to the friend at dinner had become an effort   I saw that even my love for those closest to me was become only an attempt to love that my casual relations were only what I remembered I should do from other days Divorced from reality which Zelda was to know in its irreparable aspect Fitzgerald was lucky enough to experience in an attenuated form a schizophrenia for litterateurs    Let us add another piece of luck for him that he was expert at selfpity His abuse of it preserved him from total ruin This is not a paradox An excess of sympathy for ourselves preserves our reason for such brooding over our miseries proceeds from an alarm in our vitality from a reaction of energy at the same time that it expresses an elegiac disguise of our instinct of selfpreservation Have no pity for those who pity themselves they will never give way altogether    Fitzgerald survived his crisis without surmounting it completely He hoped nonetheless to find a balance between the sense of the futility of effort and the sense of the necessity to struggle between the conviction of the inevitability of failure and still the determination to succeed Hisbeing he thought would then continue its course as an arrow shot from nothingness to nothingness with such force that only gravity would bring it to earth at last These fits of pride were accidental Deep in himself he would have liked to return in his relations with men to the subterfuges of conventional existence he would have liked to retreat To do so he would assume a mask A smile ah I would get me a smile I m still working on that smile It is to combine the best qualities of a hotel manager an experienced old social weasel a headmaster on visitors day a colored elevator man    a trained nurse coming on a new job a bodyvendor in her first rotogravure a hopeful extra swept near the camera    His crises would lead him not to mysticism or to a final despair or to suicide but to disillusion The sign CAVE CANEM is hung permanently just above my door I will try to be a correct animal though and if you throw me a bone with enough meat on it I may even lick your hand He was enough of an aesthete to modify his misanthropy with irony and to introduce a note of elegance into the economy of his disasters His casual style lets us glimpse what we might call the charm of a broken life I should even add that one is modern to the degree that one is sensitive to this charm Reaction of the disabused no doubt of individuals who incapable of resorting to a metaphysical background or to a transcendent form of salvation cling to their woes with complacency as to accepted defeats Disillusion is the equilibrium of the defeated And it was as a defeated man that Fitzgerald after conceiving the pitiless truths of The CrackUp went to Hollywood to look for success always success in which moreover he could no longer believe At the end of a Pascalian experience to write screenplays In his last years it was as if he no longer aspired to anything but compromising his abysses swallowing his neuroses as if in his heart of hearts he felt himself unworthy of the downfall he had just suffered I speak with the authority of failure he had said one day Except that with time he degraded this failure stripped it of all its spiritual value Nor should we be surprised in the real dark night of the soul he struggled more as a victim than as a hero The same is true of all those who live their drama solely in terms of psychology unsuited to perceiving an exterior absolute to combat or to yield to they eternally relapse into themselves in order to vegetate ultimately beneath the truths they have glimpsed They are once again disillusioned for disillusion retreat after a defeat is characteristic of the individual who cannot destroy himself by a disaster nor endure it to the end in order to triumph over it Disillusion is the semitragic hypostatized And since Fitzgerald could not remain worthy of his own drama we cannot count him among those of high anguish The interest he offers for us consists precisely in that disproportion between the inadequacy of his means and the extent of anxiety that he experienced A Kierkegaard a Dostoyevsky a Nietzsche override their own experiences like their spells because they are worth more than what happens to them Their destiny precedes their life This is not so for Fitzgerald his existence is inferior to what it discovers The culminating moment of his life he saw only as a disaster for which he could not console himself despite the revelations he gained from it The CrackUp is a novelist s season in hell by which we have no intention of minimizing the scope of a testimony in itself overwhelming A novelist who wants to be nothing but a novelist undergoes a crisis that for a certain time projects him outside the lies of literature He wakens to certain truths that devastate his awareness the repose of his spirit a rare event in the world of letters where sleep is de rigueur an event that in the case that concerns us has not always been grasped in its true signification Thus Fitzgerald s admirers deplore the fact that he brooded over his failure and by dint of ruminating so deeply upon it spoiled his literary career We on the contrary deplore that he did not remain sufficiently loyal to that failure that he did not sufficiently explore or exploit it It is a secondorder mind that cannot chose between literature and the real dark night of the soul   Guido Ceronetti The Body s Hell Letter to the Editor Paris March   You have asked me dear friend what sort of man is the author of Le Silence du corps Your curiosity is understandable for one cannot read this book without constantly wondering about the admirable monster who conceived it I must admit that I have actually met him only during his visits to Paris but I am frequently in contact with him by telephone and by letter And also in an indirect fashion through a person as astonishing as he an Italian girl of nineteen whom he partly brought up and who two years ago came to Paris for a stay of some months Of an amazing intellectual maturity for her age she frequently reacted like a very young girl even like a child and this melange of inspired acuity and ingenuousness made it impossible to forget her for a single instant She penetrated your life she was truly a presence an enchanted creature visited by sudden terrors that increased both her woes and her charms She was even more present in Guido s thoughts and cares I cannot of course go into details though there is nothing suspect or improper to conceal As if it were yesterday I can see the two of them in the Luxembourg on a rainy November afternoon he pale grim oppressed leaning forward and she disturbing unreal taking her tiny swift steps after him As soon as I caught sight of them I hid behind a tree The day before I had received a letter from him the most heartrending anyone had ever sent me Their sudden appearance in the empty park left me with an impression of distress of desolation that has pursued me for a long time I have forgotten to tell you that at our first meeting his expression of being nowhere of fundamental unbelonging of predestination to exile here on earth made me think immediately of Prince Myshkin Moreover the letter in question had a Dostoyevskian accent throughout For her he was unassailable he alone escaped the devastating judgments that she passed on everyone else She unreservedly adopted his vegetarian fanaticism Not to eat as other people do is more serious than not to think as they do Guido s alimentary principles no his dogmas are of a rigor that makes the manuals of ascesis read like invitations to gluttony and debauch I myself am quite obsessive about my diet but compared to the two of them I seem no better than a cannibal If you do not feed yourself as others do you do not take care of yourself as others do either Impossible to imagine Guido going into a pharmacy One day he called me from Rome to ask me to buy him in a healthfood store run by a young Vietnamese a certain Japanese yam apparently very effective against arthritis According to Guido all you have to do is rub it on your joints and the pain will stop immediately All the acquisitions of the modern world are hateful to him everything revolts him even health if it is due to chemistry And yet his book which incontestably emanates from a demand for purity attests to an undeniable craving for horror as if he were an eremite seduced by hell By the hell of the body A sure sign of failing and indeed of threatened health to feel one s organs to be conscious of them to the point of obsession The curse of dragging about a corpse is the very theme of this book From beginning to end a procession of physiological secrets that fill you with dread You have to admire the author s courage in reading so many ancient and modern treatises of gynecology certainly a terrifying task one likely to discourage for good even the most hardened satyr A voyeur s heroism in the matter of suppurations a curiosity excited by the supreme antipoetry of menstruation by hemorrhages of all kinds and by the most intimate miasmas by the fetid universe of pleasure the tragedy of the physiological functions The parts of the body that smell the strongest are those that contain the most soul All the soul s excretions all the mind s diseases all the blackness of life and that s what we call love Reading Le Silence du corps I was reminded several times of Huysmans particularly of his biography of Saint Lydwine of Schiedam Except in the essentials sanctity is answerable to the aberrations of the organs to a series of anomalies to an inexhaustible variety of disorders and this is true of whatever is profound intense unique No interior excesses without an inadmissible substratum the most ethereal ecstasy recalls in certain aspects the most crass Is Guido a connoisseur of derangements disguised as a man of erudition Sometimes I think so but ultimately not For if he has an evident weakness for corruption on the other hand he is equally solicited by what is purest in the visionary or despairing wisdom of the Old Testament Has he not admirably translated Job Ecclesiastes and Isaiah Here we are no longer in pestilence and horror but in lamentation and outcry Here is someone who lives according to a profound necessity and sometimes according to his moods on different spiritual levels His last book La Vie apparente illustrates these contradictory temptations preoccupations that are both immediate and timeless What one most loves in him is the avowal of his defeats I am a failed ascetic he confides rather embarrassed A providential failure for on its account we are sure of understanding each other of really belonging to the perduta gente Had he taken the decisive step toward salvation how easy it is to conceive of him as a monk  we should have been deprived of a delicious companion filled with imperfections manias and moods one whose elegiac inflections match his vision of a world so obviously doomed Just listen to him How can a pregnant woman read a newspaper without immediately aborting How can we judge abnormal and mentally diseased those who are terrified by the human face If you were to ask me what ordeals he passed through I would not be in a position to answer All I can tell you is that the impression he gives is of someone wounded like all those I am tempted to add to whom the gift of illusion has been denied Do not be afraid of meeting him of all creatures the least intolerable are those who hate human beings Never run away from a misanthrope  She Was Not of Their World    I ONLY MET HER TWICE Seldom enough But the extraordinary is not to be measured in terms of time I was instantly conquered by her air of absence and bewilderment her whisperings she didn t speak  her uncertain gestures her glances that did not adhere to people or things her quality of being an adorable specter    Who are you Where do you come from were the questions you wanted to ask her right away She wouldn t have been able to answer so identified was she with her mystery so reluctant to betray it No one will ever know how she managed to breathe by what aberration she yielded to the claims of breath nor what she was seeking among us The one sure thing is that she was not from here and that if she shared our fallen state it was merely out of politeness or some morbid curiosity Only angels and incurables inspire a sentiment analogous to the one you felt in her presence Fascination supernatural malaise The first moment I saw her I fell in love with her timidity a unique unforgettable timidity that gave her the appearance of a vestal exhausted in the service of a secret god or else of a mystic ravaged by the nostalgia or the abuse of ecstasy forever unfit to reinstate the surfaces of life Overwhelmed by possessions fortunate according to the worlds she nonetheless seemed utterly destitute on the threshold of an ideal beggary doomed to murmur her poverty at the heart of the Imperceptible Moreover what could she own and utter when silence stood for her soul and perplexity for the universe And did she not suggest those creatures of lunar light that Rozanov speaks of The more you thought about her the less you were inclined to regard her according to the tastes and views of time An unreal kind of malediction weighed upon her Fortunately her charm itself was inscribed within the past She should have been born elsewhere and in another age in the mist and desolation of the moors around Haworth beside the Bronte sisters    Knowing anything about faces you could readily see in hers that she was not doomed to endure that she would be spared the nightmare of the years Alive she seemed so little the accomplice of life that you could not look at her without thinking you would never see her again Adieu was the sign and the law of her nature the flash of her predestination the mark of her passage on earth hence she bore it like a nimbus not by indiscretion but by solidarity with the invisible Foreshortened Confession I WANT TO WRITE only in an explosive state in a fever or under great nervous tension in an atmosphere of settling accounts where invectives replace blows and slaps It usually begins this way a faint trembling that becomes stronger and stronger as after an insult one has swallowed without responding Expression means a belated reply or else postponed aggression I write in order not to take action to avoid a crisis Expression is relief the indirect revenge of one who cannot endure shame and who rebels in words against his kind against himself Indignation is not so much a moral as a literary impulse it is indeed the wellspring of inspiration And wisdom Just the opposite The sage in us ruins all our best impulses he is the saboteur who diminishes and paralyzes us who lies in wait for the madman within in order to calm and compromise him in order to dishonor him Inspiration A sudden disequilibrium an inordinate pleasure in affirming or destroying oneself I have not written a single line at my normal temperature And yet for years on end I regarded myself as the one individual exempt from flaws Such pride did me good it allowed me to blacken paper I virtually ceased producing when my delirium abated and I became the victim of a pernicious modesty deadly to that ferment from which intuitions and truths derive I can produce only if the sense of absurdity having suddenly abandoned me I esteem myself the beginning and the end    Writing is a provocation a fortunately false view of reality that sets us above what is and what seems to be    To rival God even to exceed Him by the mere virtue of language such is the feat of the writer an ambiguous specimen torn and infatuated who having forsaken his natural condition has given himself up to a splendid vertigo always dismaying sometimes odious Nothing more wretched than the word yet it is by the word that one mounts to sensations of felicity to an ultimate dilation where one is completely alone without the slightest feeling of oppression The Supreme achieved by syllables by the very symbol of fragility It can also be achieved oddly by irony on the condition that the latter carrying its demolition work to extremes dispenses shudders of a god in reverse Words as agents of an ecstasy inside out    Everything that is truly intense partakes of paradise and hell with this difference that the former we can only glimpse whereas we have the luck to perceive and better still to feel the latter There exists an even more notable advantage on which the writer has a monopoly that of ridding himself of his dangers Without the faculty of blackening pages I wonder what I would have become To write is to get free of one s remorse and one s rancors to vomit up one s secrets The writer is an unbalanced being who uses those words to cure himself How many disorders how many grim attacks have I not triumphed over thanks to these insubstantial remedies Writing is a vice one can weary of In truth I write less and less and I shall doubtless end up no longer writing at all no longer finding the least charm in this combat with others and with myself When one attacks a subject however ordinary one experiences a feeling of plenitude accompanied by a touch of arrogance A phenomenon stranger still that sensation of superiority when one describes a figure one admires In the middle of a sentence how easily one believes oneself the center of the world Writing and worship do not go together like it or not to speak of God is to regard Him from on high Writing is the creature s revenge and his answer to a botched Creation Translated into German by Paul Celan my Precis de Decomposition A Short History of Decay was published by Rowohlt in  When it was republished in Germany in  the editor of Akzente asked me to introduce it to the magazine s readers That is the origin of this text REREADING THIS BOOK which is now over thirty years old I try to recognize the person I was a person who escapes me to some degree My gods were Shakespeare and Shelley I still frequent the former the latter rarely I cite him to indicate the kind of poetry that intoxicated me An untidy lyricism matched my dispositions unfortunately I discern traces of it in all my efforts of the period Who can still read a poem like Epipsychidion I used to read it in any case with delight Shelley s hysterical Platonism repels me now and to effusion whatever its form I prefer concision rigor a deliberate coldness My vision of things has not fundamentally changed what certainly has changed is the tone The content of thought is rarely modified in any real way what does undergo a metamorphosis on the other hand is the turn of phrase appearance rhythm Growing old I have noticed that poetry is less and less necessary to me perhaps one s taste for it is linked to a surplus of vitality I have an increasing tendency fatigue must have a lot to do with it toward dryness toward laconism at the expense of explosion Now the Precis was an explosion Writing it I had the impression I was escaping a sense of oppression with which I could not have continued for long I had to breathe I had to break out I felt the need to come to decisive terms not so much with men as with existence as such which I would have liked to provoke to single combat if only to see which of us would win I had to be frank a quasicertitude that I would gain the upper hand that it would be impossible for existence to triumph To corner existence to force it into its last hiding places to reduce it to nothingness by frenzied reasonings and accents recalling Macbeth or Kirilov such was my ambition my intention my dream the program of my every moment One of the first chapters is called The AntiProphet As a matter of fact I reacted as a prophet assigned myself a mission a corrosive one if you like but a mission all the same By attacking the prophets I was attacking myself and    God according to my principle in those days which was that one should be concerned solely with Him and with oneself Whence the uniformly violent tone of an ultimatum not succinct as it should have been but verbose diffuse insistent  of a challenge addressed to Heaven and earth to God and to God s ersatz in short to everything In the desperate fury of those pages where it would be bootless to look for a grain of modesty of serene and resigned reflection of acceptance and respite of smiling fatalism it is the unbridled madness of my youth as well as an incoercible love of denial that attain their apogee What has always beguiled me in negation is the power of substituting oneself for everyone and everything of being a sort of demiurge of possessing the worlds as if one had collaborated in its advent and then had the right even the duty to precipitate its ruin Destruction immediate consequence of the spirit of negation corresponds to a profound instinct to a type of jealousy that each of us must experience in his heart of hearts with regard to the First Beings to His position and the idea He represents and symbolizes However much I have frequented the mystics deep down I have always sided with the Devil unable to equal him in power I have tried to be worthy of him at least in insolence acrimony arbitrariness and caprice After the Spanish publication of the Precis two Andalusian students asked me if it was possible to live without fundamentacion I answered that it was true that I had found no solid basis anywhere and that I had nonetheless managed to endure for with the years one got used to everything even vertigo Then too one does not constantly keep watch and interrogate oneself absolute lucidity being incompatible with breathing If one were at every moment conscious of what one knew if for example the sentiment of foundationlessness were both continual and intense one would kill oneself or allow oneself to slip into imbecility One exists thanks to the moments when one forgets certain truths this is because during such intervals one accumulates energy and it is energy that permits one to confront those selfsame truths When I despise myself I tell myself in order to shore up my confidence that after all I have managed to maintain myself in being or in a semblance of being with a perception of things that very few could have endured Several young people in France have told me that the chapter that most attracted them was The Automaton that intolerable quintessence In my way I must be a fighter since I have not succumbed to my ruminations The two students also asked me why I had not stopped writing and publishing Not everyone has the luck to die young was my answer My first book with its sonorous title On the Summits of Despair I wrote in Rumanian at the age of twentyone while promising myself never to begin another Then I committed a second with the same promise subsequently The farce has been repeated for over forty years Why Because writing however little has helped me pass from one year to the next the expressed obsessions being weakened and halfway overcome To produce is an extraordinary comfort And to publish another To have a book coming out that is your life or a part of your life that becomes external to you that no longer belongs to you that has ceased to torment you Expression diminishes you impoverishes you lifts weights off you expression is loss of substance and liberation It drains you hence it saves you it strips you of an encumbering overflow When you detest someone to the point of wanting to liquidate him the best thing is to take a sheet of paper and to write on it any number of times that X is a bastard a fool a monster and you will immediately discover that you hate him less and that you are no longer thinking quite so much about vengeance This is more or less what I did with regard to myself and the world The Precis I drew from my lower depths in order to insult life and insult myself The result I have endured myself a little better as I have better endured life You look after yourself as best you can The first version of the book was written very quickly in  and was called Negative Exercises I showed it to a friend who gave it back to me a few days later saying You have to rewrite the whole thing I deeply resented his advice but luckily I took it In fact I rewrote the thing three times for on no account did I want it to be considered as the work of a foreigner My ambition was nothing less than to compete with the natives Where could such effrontery have come from My parents who spoke only Rumanian and Hungarian and a little German knew no French words except bonjour and merci This was the case with almost everyone in Transylvania When I went to Bucharest in  for some sort of studies I realized that most intellectuals there spoke French fluently this produced in me who read French and no more a fury that would last for a long time and that still endures in another form since reaching Paris I have never been able to rid myself of my Wallachian accent If I cannot speak like the natives at least I shall try to write like them this must have been my unconscious reasoning otherwise how explain my desperate eagerness to do as well as they and even insane presumption better than they The efforts we expend to assert ourselves to measure ourselves against our kind and if possible to outstrip them have vile inadmissible hence powerful reasons The noble resolutions on the contrary issuing from a desire for effacement inevitably lack vigor and we quickly abandon them with or without regret Everything by which we excel proceeds from a murky and suspect source from our depths in fact And there is also this I should have chosen any other language than French for I have little in common with its distinguished vaunt it is at the antipodes of my nature of my outbursts of my true self and my kind of wretchedness In its rigidity in the quantity of elegant constraints that it represents French seems to me an exercise in ascesis or rather the combination of a straitjacket and a salon Yet it is precisely on account of this incompatibility that I have attached myself to this language to the point of exulting when the great New York scholar Erwin Chargaff born like Paul Celan in Czernowitz confided to me one day that for him only what was expressed in French deserved to exist    Today when this language is in full decline what saddens me most is to perceive that the French themselves do not seem to mind And it is I a Balkan reject who suffer at seeing it go under Well then I shall sink inconsolable with it
